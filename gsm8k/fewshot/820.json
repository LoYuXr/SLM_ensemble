    "question": "Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores for 8 hours on a particular day. She also walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, to Hollock valley shores. Calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes.",
    "completion": "To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and then sum up the times.\n\n1. **First Day:**\n   - Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores.\n   - The time taken on the first day is given as 8 hours.\n\n2. **Second Day:**\n   - Sandy walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day.\n   - Therefore, the time taken on the second day is \\( \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\) hours.\n\n3. **Total Time Calculation:**\n   - The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is the sum of the time taken on the first day and the time taken on the second day.\n   - Total time = Time on the first day + Time on the second day\n   - Total time = 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours\n\n4. **Convert Total Time to Minutes:**\n   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time from hours to minutes.\n   - Total time in minutes = 12 hours \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes\n\nTherefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes.",
    "answer": "If she walked half as many hours on the second day as the first day, she walked for 1/2*8 = <<8*1/2=4>>4 hours on the second day.\nThe total time Sandy walked in the two days is 8+4 =<<8+4=12>>12 hours.\nSince 1 hour has 60 minutes, Sandy walked for 12*60 = <<12*60=720>>720 minutes in the two days.\n#### 720"
