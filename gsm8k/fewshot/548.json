    "question": "Mark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month. If his final weight was 70 pounds, what was his initial weight?",
    "completion": "To determine Mark's initial weight, we need to work backwards from his final weight. We know that Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, and his final weight is 70 pounds.\n\nLet's denote Mark's initial weight as \\( W \\).\n\n1. After 3 months, Mark's weight is 70 pounds. So, after 3 months, his weight was \\( W - 3 \\times 10 \\) pounds.\n2. This means that after 3 months, his weight was \\( W - 30 \\) pounds.\n3. According to the problem, after 3 months, his weight was 70 pounds. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   W - 30 = 70\n   \\]\n4. To find \\( W \\), we solve the equation by adding 30 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   W = 70 + 30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   W = 100\n   \\]\n\nSo, Mark's initial weight was \\(\\boxed{100}\\) pounds.",
    "answer": "Since Mark was losing 10 pounds each month, in 3 months he lost 10 * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 pounds.\nAdding the weight lost to the final weight gives an initial weight of 70 + 30 = <<70+30=100>>100 pounds.\nMark's initial weight was 100 pounds.\n#### 100"
