    "question": "At the Burger Palace restaurant, there is an enormous jar containing red, blue and green jelly beans.  On the outside of the jar is a note that reads, \"This jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.\"  If the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans, how many more green jelly beans does it contain than red jelly beans?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans in the jar, we need to set up equations based on the given information and solve for the number of red and green jelly beans.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( R \\) as the number of red jelly beans.\n- \\( B \\) as the number of blue jelly beans.\n- \\( G \\) as the number of green jelly beans.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500.\n2. The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.\n3. The jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.\n\nFirst, we express the total number of jelly beans in terms of \\( R \\), \\( B \\), and \\( G \\):\n\\[ R + B + G = 4500 \\]\n\nNext, we use the information about the percentage of red and green jelly beans:\n\\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \\]\n\\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \\]\n\nNow, substitute these expressions into the total jelly bean equation:\n\\[ R + B + G = 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \\]\n\\[ 3.00B = 4500 \\]\n\nSolve for \\( B \\):\n\\[ B = \\frac{4500}{3.00} = 1500 \\]\n\nNow that we have \\( B \\), we can find \\( R \\) and \\( G \\):\n\\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \\times 1500 = 1485 \\]\n\\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \\times 1500 = 1515 \\]\n\nFinally, we need to find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:\n\\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \\]\n\nThus, there are \\(\\boxed{30}\\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans in the jar.",
    "answer": "If the total number of jelly beans is 4500, there must be 1500 blue jelly beans\n4500/3= <<4500/3=1500>>1500\n1500/100= <<1500/100=15>>15 jelly beans (1% of blue jelly beans)\n1500+15= <<1500+15=1515>>1515 Green Jelly beans\n1500-15= <<1500-15=1485>>1485 Red Jelly beans\n1515-1485= <<1515-1485=30>>30 jelly beans difference between red and green\n#### 30"
