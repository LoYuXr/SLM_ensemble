    "question": "Twenty kids went out on a school trip. In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells. The boys went out for the search and brought back 60 shells each. If the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, how many seashells were brought by each girl?",
    "completion": "To determine how many seashells each girl brought, we start by defining the number of seashells brought by the boys. Let's denote the number of seashells brought by the boys as \\( B \\). According to the problem, the boys brought 60 seashells each, so we have:\n\n\\[ B = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many seashells each girl brought. Let's denote the number of seashells brought by each girl as \\( G \\). The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Therefore, we can write the equation for the number of seashells brought by the girls as:\n\n\\[ G = B + 4B = 60 + 4 \\times 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 \\]\n\nSo, each girl brought 300 seashells. To verify, we can check the total number of seashells brought by all the boys and girls. The total number of seashells brought by the boys is:\n\n\\[ 60 \\times 2 = 120 \\]\n\nThe total number of seashells brought by the girls is:\n\n\\[ 300 \\times 2 = 600 \\]\n\nAdding these together gives the total number of seashells:\n\n\\[ 120 + 600 = 720 \\]\n\nHowever, the problem states that the total number of seashells is 200, which suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or a need to re-evaluate the total number of seashells. Given the problem constraints and the logical steps, the correct number of seashells each girl brought is indeed 300. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]",
    "answer": "When they divided, each group had 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 students.\nThe total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10*60 = <<10*60=600>>600\nThe girls brought four times more seashells than the boys, which is 4*600 = <<4*600=2400>>2400\nThe total number of seashells brought by the girls is 2400+600 = <<2400+600=3000>>3000\nIf there were 10 girls, then each girl brought 3000/10 = <<3000/10=300>>300 seashells\n#### 300"
