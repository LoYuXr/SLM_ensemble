    "question": "The rainstorm flooded the wetlands and washed Phineas Frog 200 yards away from his home in the swamp.  To return home, he will need to hop and swim his way back.  If he hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute, and swims through water at a speed of 10 yards per minute, how long will it take Phineas, in minutes, to return home if half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it will take Phineas to return home, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts and calculate the time for each part separately.\n\n1. **Determine the total distance to return home:**\n   The total distance is 200 yards.\n\n2. **Calculate the distance on land:**\n   Since half of the distance is on land, the distance on land is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{200 \\text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \\text{ yards}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the distance in water:**\n   The other half of the distance is in water, so the distance in water is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{200 \\text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \\text{ yards}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the time to hop on land:**\n   Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. Therefore, the time to hop on land is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{100 \\text{ yards}}{20 \\text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the time to swim through water:**\n   Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. Therefore, the time to swim through water is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{100 \\text{ yards}}{10 \\text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total time to return home:**\n   The total time is the sum of the time to hop on land and the time to swim through water:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ minutes} + 10 \\text{ minutes} = 15 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is \\(\\boxed{15}\\) minutes.",
    "answer": "Half of 200 yards is 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100 yards.\n100 yards at 20 yards per minute is 100/20=<<100/20=5>>5 minutes.\n100 yards at 10 yards per minute is 100/10=<<100/10=10>>10 minutes.\nIn total, it will take Phineas 5+10=<<5+10=15>>15 minutes to return home.\n#### 15"
