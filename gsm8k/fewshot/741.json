    "question": "Jeremy saw 12 birds in their backyard and threw a stone at them, scaring away 1/3 of that number. A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. How many birds are now in the backyard?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of birds in Jeremy's backyard after the events, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Number of Birds**: Jeremy initially saw 12 birds in their backyard.\n2. **Birds Scared Away**: Jeremy threw a stone at the birds, scaring away \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the birds. To find out how many birds were scared away, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, 4 birds were scared away.\n\n3. **Remaining Birds**: Subtract the number of birds scared away from the initial number of birds:\n   \\[\n   12 - 4 = 8\n   \\]\n   Therefore, there are 8 birds remaining in the backyard.\n\n4. **Birds Joined Later**: A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. To find out how many birds there are now, we add the 20 new birds to the 8 birds that were initially scared away:\n   \\[\n   8 + 20 = 28\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of birds in the backyard now is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",
    "answer": "The total number of birds scared away after he threw the stone at them is 1/3 * 12 = <<1/3*12=4>>4 birds.\nThe total number of birds remaining is 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 birds.\nIf 20 more birds joined, the total number of birds in the backyard will become 8 + 20 = <<8+20=28>>28 birds.\n#### 28"
