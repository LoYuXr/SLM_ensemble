    "question": "The temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight and then increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. What was the temperature, in degrees Celsius, in the morning?",
    "completion": "To determine the temperature in the morning, we need to follow the changes in temperature step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Temperature**: The temperature was 2 degrees Celsius.\n2. **Temperature Drop Overnight**: The temperature dropped by 8 degrees Celsius overnight. So, we subtract 8 degrees from the initial temperature:\n   \\[\n   2 - 8 = -6 \\text{ degrees Celsius}\n   \\]\n   This means the temperature was -6 degrees Celsius at the end of the night.\n3. **Temperature Increase in the Morning**: The temperature then increased by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. So, we add 3 degrees to the temperature at the end of the night:\n   \\[\n   -6 + 3 = -3 \\text{ degrees Celsius}\n   \\]\n   This means the temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius.\n\nTherefore, the temperature in the morning was \\(\\boxed{-3}\\) degrees Celsius.",
    "answer": "Start = +<<2=2>>2 degrees\nDrop 8 degrees = 2 - 8 = -6 degrees\nIncrease 3 degrees = -6 + 3 = -3 degrees\nIt was -3 degrees Celsius in the morning.\n#### -3"
