    "question": "The Adams family is busy making cookies. So far, they've made 7995 cookies. They have 2595 rainbow cookies, 3075 oatmeal cookies, and some chocolate chip cookies. How many chocolate chip cookies have they made?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies made by the Adams family, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of cookies made by the Adams family.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cookies} = 7995\n   \\]\n\n2. Identify the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies made.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rainbow cookies} = 2595\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Oatmeal cookies} = 3075\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total rainbow and oatmeal cookies} = 2595 + 3075 = 5670\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies to find the number of chocolate chip cookies.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Chocolate chip cookies} = 7995 - 5670 = 2325\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of chocolate chip cookies made by the Adams family is \\boxed{2325}.",
    "answer": "The total number of pieces of rainbow and oatmeal cookies is 2595 + 3075 = <<2595+3075=5670>>5670.\nTherefore, they made 7995 - 5670 = <<7995-5670=2325>>2325 chocolate chip cookies.\n#### 2325"
