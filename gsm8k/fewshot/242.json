    "question": "Mike was a pen pal with 5 people.  He stopped being penpals with 2 of them.  They each send 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long.  He responds in kind.  He can write a page every 6 minutes.  How many hours does he spend writing a week?",
    "completion": "To determine how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of letters sent by Mike:**\n   - Mike has 5 pen pals.\n   - Each pen pal sends 2 letters per week.\n   - Therefore, the total number of letters sent is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ pens} \\times 2 \\text{ letters per pen pal} = 10 \\text{ letters}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of pages written:**\n   - Each letter is 5 pages long.\n   - Therefore, the total number of pages written is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\text{ letters} \\times 5 \\text{ pages per letter} = 50 \\text{ pages}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of minutes Mike spends writing:**\n   - Mike writes a page every 6 minutes.\n   - Therefore, the total number of minutes spent writing is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{50 \\text{ pages}}{6 \\text{ minutes per page}} = \\frac{50}{6} \\text{ minutes} \\approx 8.33 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert the total minutes into hours:**\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n   - Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{8.33 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes per hour}} \\approx 0.1383 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Round to a reasonable number of decimal places:**\n   - Typically, we round to two decimal places for practical purposes.\n   - Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing is:\n     \\[\n     0.1383 \\text{ hours} \\approx 0.14 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Mike spends approximately \\(\\boxed{0.14}\\) hours writing a week.",
    "answer": "He is penpals with 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 people\nThus he gets 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 letters a week\nSo he writes 6*5=<<6*5=30>>30 pages a week\nSo he writes for 30*6=<<30*6=180>>180 minutes a week\nSo he writes 180/60=<<180/60=3>>3 hours a week\n#### 3"
