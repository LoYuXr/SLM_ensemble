    "question": "A simple folding newspaper or tabloid can be made by folding a piece of paper vertically and unfolding. Then, say, page 1 is printed on the left back, page 2 is printed on the left front, and then, perhaps page 32 is printed on the right back, and page 31 is printed on the right front. How many pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the pattern of how the pages are printed. The pages are printed in a repeating sequence of 12 pages (from left to right) and then printed in a different sequence of 12 pages (from right to left).\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the sequence of pages printed:**\n   - The first page is printed on the left back.\n   - The second page is printed on the left front.\n   - The third page is printed on the right back.\n   - The fourth page is printed on the right front.\n   - This pattern repeats every 12 pages.\n\n2. **Determine the number of complete cycles of 12 pages in 32 pages:**\n   - Since 32 is a multiple of 12, we can calculate the number of complete cycles in 32 pages.\n   - \\(32 \\div 12 = 2\\) with a remainder of 4.\n   - This means there are 2 complete cycles of 12 pages in 32 pages.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of pages in one complete cycle:**\n   - Each complete cycle consists of 12 pages.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of pages in 2 complete cycles:**\n   - \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) pages.\n\n5. **Determine the number of pages printed in the remaining pages:**\n   - The remaining pages are 32 - 24 = 8 pages.\n   - These 8 pages are printed in the same sequence as the first 8 pages of the first cycle, which is 12 pages.\n\n6. **Calculate the total number of pages printed:**\n   - Total pages printed = 24 (from the complete cycles) + 12 (from the remaining pages) = 36 pages.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
    "answer": "Each piece prints 4 pages.\nThen 32/4=<<32/4=8>>8 pieces of paper would be used.\n#### 8"
