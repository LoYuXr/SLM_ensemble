    "question": "Charisma works for 8 hours every day.  She has a timer to remind her to get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour she\u2019s at work.  After 5 days at the office, how many minutes has she walked?",
    "completion": "To determine how many minutes Charisma has walked, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of hours Charisma works at the office:**\n   - Charisma works 8 hours every day.\n   - She works for 5 days at the office.\n   - Therefore, the total number of hours she works is:\n     \\[\n     8 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 40 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of minutes Charisma walks:**\n   - Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour she works.\n   - Therefore, the total number of minutes she walks is:\n     \\[\n     40 \\text{ hours} \\times 5 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 200 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nThus, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked for a total of \\boxed{200} minutes.",
    "answer": "She works 8 hours every day and she sets a timer to walk 5 minutes every hour for a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 minutes of walking\nIf she walks 40 minutes a day while at the office then over 5 days she walks 40*5 = <<40*5=200>>200 minutes\n#### 200"
