    "question": "Tim wanted to make lemonade for a pool party.  For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?",
    "completion": "To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed for 4 gallons of lemonade.\n2. Determine the amount of lemon juice needed for the extra gallon.\n3. Calculate the number of lemons required for the extra gallon.\n\nFirst, we know that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice. Therefore, for 4 gallons of lemonade, the total amount of lemon juice needed is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ gallons} \\times 6 \\text{ lemons/gallon} = 24 \\text{ cups of lemon juice} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much lemon juice is needed for the extra gallon. Since the extra gallon is twice as tart as the other gallons, we can assume that the lemon juice for the extra gallon is the same as the lemon juice for the other 3 gallons. Therefore, the lemon juice for the extra gallon is:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many lemons are required for 24 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice, the number of lemons needed for 24 cups of lemon juice is:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ cups} \\times 6 \\text{ lemons/cup} = 144 \\text{ lemons} \\]\n\nThus, the number of lemons Tim will need is:\n\\[ \\boxed{144} \\]",
    "answer": "Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch\nIn addition, he will make 4 regular gallons of lemonade, which each need 1 cup juice so 4*1 = <<4*1=4>>4 cups total\nAll total he will need 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups of juice\nEach cup requires 6 lemons each and he needs 6 cups of juice so 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 lemons needed\n#### 36"
