    "question": "Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils which give a total of 26 pencils. If her sister, Meg, has 46 pencils, how many boxes do Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils?",
    "completion": "To determine how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:**\n   - Jam has three boxes.\n   - Each box contains 26 pencils.\n   - Therefore, the total number of pencils Jam has is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 26 = 78\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of pencils Meg has:**\n   - Meg has 46 pencils.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together:**\n   - Add the number of pencils Jam has to the number of pencils Meg has:\n     \\[\n     78 + 46 = 124\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils:**\n   - Each box contains 26 pencils.\n   - To find out how many boxes are needed, divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{124}{26} = 4.615384615384615\n     \\]\n   - Since the number of boxes must be a whole number, we need to round up to the next whole number because even a fraction of a box means one more box is needed.\n\nTherefore, Jam and Meg need \\(\\boxed{5}\\) boxes to store all their pencils.",
    "answer": "There are a total of 26 - 2 = <<26-2=24>>24 pencils in the three boxes.\nThus, each box can contain 24 / 3 = <<24/3=8>>8 pencils.\nTogether, Jam and Meg have 26 + 46 = <<26+46=72>>72 pencils.\nTherefore, they need 72 / 8 = <<72/8=9>>9 boxes to put in all their pencils.\n#### 9"
