    "question": "The employees of Google went on a day trip. 4 buses were rented that have the capacity of holding 60 employees. 6 minibusses that can hold 30 employees, and 10 minivans that can hold 15 employees. How many employees can join the day trip?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.\n\n1. **Buses:**\n   - Each bus can hold 60 employees.\n   - There are 4 buses.\n   - Total capacity of buses = \\( 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\) employees.\n\n2. **Minibusses:**\n   - Each minibus can hold 30 employees.\n   - There are 6 minibusses.\n   - Total capacity of minibusses = \\( 6 \\times 30 = 180 \\) employees.\n\n3. **Minivans:**\n   - Each minivan can hold 15 employees.\n   - There are 10 minivans.\n   - Total capacity of minivans = \\( 10 \\times 15 = 150 \\) employees.\n\nNow, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:\n\\[\n240 \\text{ (buses)} + 180 \\text{ (minibusses)} + 150 \\text{ (minivans)} = 570 \\text{ employees}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is \\(\\boxed{570}\\).",
    "answer": "60 x 4 = <<60*4=240>>240 employees can ride on the bus.\n30 x 6 = <<30*6=180>>180 employees can ride on the minibusses.\n15 x 10 = <<15*10=150>>150 employees can ride on the minivans.\nTherefore 240 + 180 + 150 = <<240+180+150=570>>570 employees can join the day trip.\n#### 570"
