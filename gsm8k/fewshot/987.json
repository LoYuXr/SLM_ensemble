    "question": "Artemis is potting flowers with her father. They buy a 30-pound bag of soil. Each rose needs 1 pound. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds. Each Sunflower needs 3 pounds. If they plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations, how many roses can they plant?",
    "completion": "To determine how many roses Artemis can plant, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of soil available.\n2. Determine the total amount of soil needed for the sunflowers and carnations.\n3. Subtract the amount of soil needed for the sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil available to find out how much soil is left for the roses.\n\nLet's start with the total amount of soil available:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of soil needed for the sunflowers and carnations:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ sunflowers} \\times 3 \\text{ pounds per sunflower} = 12 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\\[ 10 \\text{ carnations} \\times 1.5 \\text{ pounds per carnation} = 15 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\\[ 12 \\text{ pounds} + 15 \\text{ pounds} = 27 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the amount of soil needed for the sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil available:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ pounds} - 27 \\text{ pounds} = 3 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSince each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses that can be planted is:\n\\[ \\frac{3 \\text{ pounds}}{1 \\text{ pound per rose}} = 3 \\text{ roses} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of roses that can be planted is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]",
    "answer": "They used 12 pounds on the sunflowers because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12\nThey used 15 pounds on carnations because 10 x 1.5 = <<10*1.5=15>>15\nThey have used 27 pounds in total because 12 + 15 = <<12+15=27>>27\nThey have 30 pounds left because 30 - 27 = <<30-27=3>>3\nThe can plant three roses because 3 / 1 = <<3/1=3>>3\n#### 3"
