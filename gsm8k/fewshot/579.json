    "question": "A boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has. How many cards do they have together?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of cards the boy and his brother have together, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of cards the boy has.\n   The boy has 5 cards.\n\n2. Determine how many cards the brother has.\n   The brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy. Therefore, the brother has \\(5 - 3 = 2\\) cards.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of cards the boy and his brother have together.\n   The total number of cards is the sum of the cards the boy has and the cards the brother has. So, we add 5 and 2:\n   \\[\n   5 + 2 = 7\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of cards the boy and his brother have together is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
    "answer": "His brother has 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 cards.\nTogether, they have 5 + 2 = <<5+2=7>>7 cards.\n#### 7"
