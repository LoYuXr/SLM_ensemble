    "question": "Prince is a butcher. He sells 15kg of meat every hour he works, and he works 10 hours a day. His friend Bill gives him a bull that weighs 750kg. How many days will it take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull?",
    "completion": "To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day.\n2. Determine how many days it will take for Prince to sell the entire weight of the bull.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day. Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the total amount of meat he can sell in one day is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ kg/hour} \\times 10 \\text{ hours/day} = 150 \\text{ kg/day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many days it will take for Prince to sell the entire weight of the bull, which weighs 750 kg. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince can sell in one day:\n\\[ \\frac{750 \\text{ kg}}{150 \\text{ kg/day}} = 5 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Prince \\(\\boxed{5}\\) days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.",
    "answer": "In a day Bill sells 15 * 10 = <<15*10=150>>150kg of meat.\nIt will take Bill 750 / 150 = <<750/150=5>>5 days to sell all the meat from the bull.\n#### 5"
