    "question": "Mark decides to buy packs of old magic cards and open them to sell.  He buys 3 packs for $1800 each.  He gets 1 card that is worth $4000 and another card worth $1000.  There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each.  How much money profit did he make?",
    "completion": "To determine the profit Mark made, we need to calculate the total cost of the magic cards and then subtract the total revenue from the total cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the magic cards:\n- Mark buys 3 packs of cards at $1800 each.\n- The cost per pack is $1800.\n- Therefore, the total cost for 3 packs is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 1800 = 5400 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we add the value of the 1 card worth $4000 and the 1 card worth $1000:\n- The value of the 1 card worth $4000 is $4000.\n- The value of the 1 card worth $1000 is $1000.\n- Therefore, the total value of the 2 cards is:\n  \\[\n  4000 + 1000 = 5000 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we add the value of the 30 cards worth $50 each to the total value of the 2 cards:\n- The value of each of the 30 cards is $50.\n- Therefore, the total value of the 30 cards is:\n  \\[\n  30 \\times 50 = 1500 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total revenue by adding the value of the 1 card worth $4000, the 1 card worth $1000, and the total value of the 30 cards:\n- The total revenue is:\n  \\[\n  4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nThe profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:\n- The profit is:\n  \\[\n  6500 - 5400 = 1100 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the profit Mark made is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1100}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The cheaper cards are worth a total of 30*50=$<<30*50=1500>>1500\nSo all the cards together are worth 1500+4000+1000=$<<1500+4000+1000=6500>>6500\nThe cost for the cards was 1800*3=$<<1800*3=5400>>5400\nSo he made a profit of 6500-5400=$<<6500-5400=1100>>1100\n#### 1100"
