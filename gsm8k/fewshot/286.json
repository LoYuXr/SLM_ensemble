    "question": "Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, how many cents will she have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how many cents Kelly will have left after buying a can of pop, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Kelly has initially.\n2. Subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has initially. Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. We know that:\n- 1 quarter is worth 25 cents.\n- 1 dime is worth 10 cents.\n\nSo, the total amount of money in cents is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ quarters} \\times 25 \\text{ cents/quarter} + 2 \\text{ dimes} \\times 10 \\text{ cents/dime} \\]\n\\[ = 5 \\times 25 + 2 \\times 10 \\]\n\\[ = 125 + 20 \\]\n\\[ = 145 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money:\n\\[ 145 \\text{ cents} - 55 \\text{ cents} = 90 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Kelly will have left is \\(\\boxed{90}\\) cents.",
    "answer": "Her quarters are worth 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 cents.\nThe dimes are worth 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 cents\nKelly has a total of 125 + 20 = <<125+20=145>>145 cents\nAfter buying the can of pop, Kelly will have 145 - 55 = <<145-55=90>>90 cents left.\n#### 90"
