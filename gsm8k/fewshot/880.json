    "question": "Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 a meter. Sarah plans to use the profit to buy a new rope, which at the store costs $1.5 a meter. How much money will she have left over after she buys the new rope?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the new rope.\n2. Determine the profit Sarah will make from selling the old rope.\n3. Subtract the profit from the total cost of the new rope to find out how much money Sarah will have left over.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and the old rope is 20 meters long. Therefore, the total cost of the new rope is:\n\\[ 1.5 \\times 20 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the profit Sarah will make from selling the old rope. The profit is the total cost of the new rope minus the cost of the old rope:\n\\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the profit from the total cost of the new rope to find out how much money Sarah will have left over:\n\\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
    "answer": "Her friend pays her $40 for the rope because 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40\nShe can buy the rope at the store for $30 because 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30\nShe has $10 left over because 40 - 30 = <<40-30=10>>10\n#### 10"
