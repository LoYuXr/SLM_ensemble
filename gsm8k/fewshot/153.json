    "question": "Dave bought a large pack of french fries and ate fourteen before a hungry seagull stole the pack out of his hand. When the seagull landed, he gobbled down half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Then three pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries. Later, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it, we need to work backwards from the information given. Let's denote the initial number of french fries as \\( F \\).\n\n1. Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole the pack.\n2. The seagull then stole half of the fries Dave ate, so Dave ate \\( 14 / 2 = 7 \\) fries.\n3. After the seagull stole the fries, three pigeons bullied Dave away, and each pigeon ate 3 fries, so Dave ate \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\) fries.\n4. After the pigeons stole the fries, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the raccoon stole \\( 9 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 6 \\) fries.\n5. After the raccoon stole the fries, Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 fries behind.\n\nNow, let's work backwards from the last step:\n\n- The raccoon stole 6 fries, so there were \\( 9 + 6 = 15 \\) fries left.\n- Ants carried off 1 French fry, so there were \\( 15 - 1 = 14 \\) fries left.\n- The seagull stole 7 fries, so there were \\( 14 - 7 = 7 \\) fries left.\n- The seagull then stole half of the fries Dave ate, so Dave ate \\( 7 / 2 = 3.5 \\) fries, but since the number of fries must be a whole number, we assume Dave ate 3 fries (as the problem implies whole fries).\n- Therefore, there were \\( 7 - 3 = 4 \\) fries left after Dave ate 3 fries.\n- The seagull then stole 14 fries, so there were \\( 4 - 14 = -10 \\) fries, but since the number of fries must be a whole number, we assume Dave ate 14 fries (as the problem implies whole fries).\n- Therefore, there were \\( 4 - 14 = -10 \\) fries left, but since the number of fries must be a whole number, we assume Dave ate 14 fries (as the problem implies whole fries).\n\nThus, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
    "answer": "Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.\nThe 3 pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 fries.\nThe ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.\nThe raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.\nThus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.\n#### 48"
