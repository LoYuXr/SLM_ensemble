    "question": "Debra is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?",
    "completion": "To determine how many bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of bees that leave and return over the 12-hour period.\n\n1. **First 6 hours:**\n   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.\n   - Number of bees that return in the next 6 hours: \\( \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\) bees.\n\n2. **Next 6 hours:**\n   - Debra sees 15 bees return.\n   - Number of bees that fly back to the hive: \\( 15 \\times 2 = 30 \\) bees.\n\n3. **Last 6 hours:**\n   - The last 6 hours are when the bees that flew back return to the hive.\n   - Number of bees that fly back to the hive: 30 bees.\n\nNow, we sum up the bees that fly back to the hive over the last 6 hours:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ (first 6 hours)} + 30 \\text{ (next 6 hours)} = 60 \\text{ bees} \\]\n\nThus, the number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
    "answer": "Debra first sees 30 bees leave the hive, then sees 1/2 that many return, 30 x 1/2 = <<30*1/2=15>>15 bees that return and 15 bees that are still away from the hive.\nDebra sees twice as many bees as first left the hive--which was 30--fly from the hive in the next 6 hours, 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 bees that leave the hive.\nIn total, 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 bees left the hive.\nThere were 90 bees total that left the hive - 15 bees that already returned = <<90-15=75>>75 bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.\n#### 75"
