    "question": "Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of lines for the first scene. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. The solo song has 54 lines, so the first scene has:\n\\[ 2 \\times 54 = 108 \\text{ lines} \\]\n\nNext, let's find the number of lines for the second scene. The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. The solo song has 54 lines, so the second scene has:\n\\[ 54 + 6 = 60 \\text{ lines} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of lines Sean has to memorize for each scene. The first scene has 108 lines, and Sean's lines are a third of the lines in the first scene:\n\\[ \\frac{108}{3} = 36 \\text{ lines} \\]\n\nThe second scene has 60 lines, and Sean's lines are a fourth of the lines in the second scene:\n\\[ \\frac{60}{4} = 15 \\text{ lines} \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the lines Sean has to memorize for both scenes:\n\\[ 36 + 15 = 51 \\text{ lines} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is:\n\\[ \\boxed{51} \\]",
    "answer": "The first scene has twice the number of lines as his solo song, so it has 2 * 54 = <<2*54=108>>108 lines.\nA third of them are Sean\u2019s lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = <<108/3=36>>36 lines.\nThe second scene has 54 + 6 = <<54+6=60>>60 lines.\nFour fifths of the second scene\u2019s lines are Sean\u2019s, so he has to memorize 4 * 60 / 5 = 4 * 12 = <<4*60/5=48>>48 lines.\nSean has to memorize his entire solo song, so he has to memorize 54 + 36 + 48 = <<54+36+48=138>>138 lines in all.\n#### 138"
