    "question": "Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as her less-experienced colleague Jewel. Daily, Jewel processes 50 customers. What is the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week?",
    "completion": "To determine the total weekly production for Julie and her colleague Jewel, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the production rate of each person:**\n   - Let \\( J \\) be the production rate of Jewel per day.\n   - Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, her production rate is \\( 2J \\) per day.\n\n2. **Determine the daily production for each person:**\n   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.\n   - Therefore, her daily production is \\( 50J \\) customers.\n\n3. **Calculate the total production for each person over the course of a week:**\n   - There are 7 days in a week.\n   - So, the total production for Jewel in a week is \\( 7 \\times 50J = 350J \\) customers.\n   - The total production for Julie in a week is \\( 7 \\times 2J = 14J \\) customers.\n\n4. **Find the combined total production for both people over the week:**\n   - The combined total production is \\( 350J + 14J = 364J \\) customers.\n\nThus, the total weekly production for the two is \\(\\boxed{364J}\\).",
    "answer": "While Jewel is processing 50 orders in a day, Julie processes 50 orders/day * 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 orders/day.\nIn a day, they process 100 orders/day + 50 orders/day = <<100+50=150>>150 orders together.\nThe total number of orders the two processes in a week is 150 orders/day * 7 days/week = <<150*7=1050>>1050 orders\n#### 1050"
