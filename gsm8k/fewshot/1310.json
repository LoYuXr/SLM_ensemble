    "question": "Aaron and Vanessa were relay race partners on a running team. Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa was able to run twice as far as Aaron did. If Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, how long in minutes did Vanessa take to complete her part?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Aaron's speed:**\n   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.\n   - Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.\n   - Therefore, Aaron's speed is \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\) miles per hour.\n\n2. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**\n   - Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did.\n   - Since Aaron ran 4 miles, Vanessa ran \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\) miles.\n   - Vanessa's speed is \\( \\frac{8 \\text{ miles}}{16 \\text{ minutes}} = 0.5 \\text{ miles per minute} \\).\n\n3. **Determine Vanessa's time to complete her part:**\n   - Vanessa ran 8 miles in 16 minutes.\n   - To find the time it took her to complete her part, we divide the total distance by her speed:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{8 \\text{ miles}}{0.5 \\text{ miles per minute}} = 16 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Vanessa took \\(\\boxed{16}\\) minutes to complete her part of the race.",
    "answer": "Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 miles.\nAaron took 16 minutes, so he ran each mile in 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 minutes.\nVanessa takes twice as long to run a mile, so she took 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 minutes for each mile.\nShe ran 4 miles, so she took 4 * 16 = <<4*16=64>>64 minutes to complete her part of the race.\n#### 64"
