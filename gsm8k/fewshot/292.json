    "question": "Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes for an online task she does. If she works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. and pauses in between for half an hour, how much money does she earn for the online task?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Susan earns for the online task, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate the earnings accordingly.\n\n1. **Determine the total time Susan works:**\n   - Susan works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.\n   - Since she pauses for half an hour, the total time she works is \\(3 \\text{ hours} + 0.5 \\text{ hours} = 3.5 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the number of 10-minute intervals in 3.5 hours:**\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 3.5 hours, there are \\(3.5 \\times 60 = 210\\) minutes.\n   - Since each 10-minute interval is 10 minutes, the number of 10-minute intervals in 210 minutes is \\(210 \\div 10 = 21\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the total earnings:**\n   - Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval.\n   - Therefore, her total earnings are \\(21 \\times 5 = 105\\) dollars.\n\nSo, the amount of money Susan earns for the online task is \\(\\boxed{105}\\).",
    "answer": "Because she rests for half an hour, the time she works is 11 - 8 - 0.5 = <<11-8-0.5=2.5>>2.5 hours.\nSo she works 2.5 * 60 = <<2.5*60=150>>150 minutes\nShe earns $5 per 10 minutes, so for the online task she earns in total 150 * 5/10=$<<150*5/10=75>>75.\n#### 75"
