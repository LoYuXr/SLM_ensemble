    "question": "Archie buys beef jerky that comes 30 sticks to a bag and costs $18.00 per bag.  If Archie buys 1 bag while they're $3.00 off a bag, how much will each stick of jerky cost in cents?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost per stick of beef jerky, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the 1 bag of jerky.\n2. Determine the discounted price of the 1 bag of jerky.\n3. Find the cost per stick of jerky.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the 1 bag of jerky. The original price of the 1 bag is $18.00, and they are $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is:\n\\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the cost per stick of jerky. Since the 1 bag costs $15.00 and contains 30 sticks, the cost per stick is:\n\\[ \\frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \\text{ dollars per stick} \\]\n\nSince we need the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents by multiplying by 100:\n\\[ 0.50 \\times 100 = 50 \\text{ cents per stick} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost per stick of jerky is \\(\\boxed{50}\\) cents.",
    "answer": "The bags are $18.00 with a $3.00 coupon so each bag is 18-3 = $<<18-3=15.00>>15.00\nThe bag has 30 sticks of jerky and costs $15.00 so each stick will cost 15/30 = $0.50\n#### 50"
