    "question": "Lorie earns $10 per hour. Karen earns twice what Lorie earns. How much does Karen earn in two days if she works 3 hours per day?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Karen earns in two days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Karen's hourly wage.\n2. Determine how much Karen earns in one day.\n3. Calculate how much Karen earns in two days.\n\nFirst, we know that Lorie earns $10 per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, we can calculate Karen's hourly wage as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Karen's hourly wage} = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ dollars per hour} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much Karen earns in one day. Since she works 3 hours per day, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works each day:\n\\[ \\text{Karen's earnings per day} = 20 \\times 3 = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, to find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:\n\\[ \\text{Karen's earnings in two days} = 60 \\times 2 = 120 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Karen earns \\(\\boxed{120}\\) dollars in two days.",
    "answer": "Karen earns $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20 per hour.\nSo she earns $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60 per day.\nThus, she earns $60 x 2 = $<<60*2=120>>120 in two days.\n#### 120"
