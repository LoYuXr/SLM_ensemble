    "question": "A perfume company is trying to create new scents. They already have 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents available. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of vanilla scents sold.\n2. Identify the number of fruity scents sold.\n3. Subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n- The perfume company already has 4 vanilla scents available.\n- They sell 5 vanilla scents in total.\n- The perfume company already has 8 fruity scents available.\n- They sell 2 fruity scents in total.\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference:\n- Number of vanilla scents sold: 5\n- Number of fruity scents sold: 2\n\nDifference = Number of vanilla scents sold - Number of fruity scents sold\nDifference = 5 - 2\nDifference = 3\n\nTherefore, the perfume company sold 3 more vanilla scents compared to fruity scents.",
    "answer": "The store sold 4 types of vanilla scents * 5 sales each = <<4*5=20>>20 of the vanilla scents.\nThe store sold 8 types of fruity scents * 2 sales each = <<8*2=16>>16 of the fruity scents.\nThis means that the store sold 20 vanilla \u2013 16 fruity = <<20-16=4>>4 more vanilla scents.\n#### 4"
