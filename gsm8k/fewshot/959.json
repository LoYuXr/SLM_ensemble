    "question": "Coach brought one bag filled with basketballs to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor before practice began.  After the practice time was over, he asked Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey to pick up the balls and carry them over to the bag.  The three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip.  Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. If Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, what is the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of basketballs the coach brought to practice, we need to set up equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's denote the number of balls Jason carried as \\( J \\).\n\nAccording to the problem:\n- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried \\( \\frac{J}{2} \\) balls.\n- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jordan, so Jordan carried \\( 2J \\) balls.\n\nThe total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls each boy carried:\n\\[ J + \\frac{J}{2} + 2J \\]\n\nWe can simplify this expression:\n\\[ J + \\frac{J}{2} + 2J = J + \\frac{J}{2} + \\frac{4J}{2} = J + \\frac{5J}{2} = \\frac{2J}{2} + \\frac{5J}{2} = \\frac{7J}{2} \\]\n\nSince the total number of balls carried by the three boys is equal to the total number of balls the coach brought, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{7J}{2} = \\text{Total number of balls} \\]\n\nThe total number of balls the coach brought is the sum of the balls each boy carried:\n\\[ J + \\frac{J}{2} + 2J = \\frac{2J}{2} + \\frac{J}{2} + \\frac{4J}{2} = \\frac{7J}{2} \\]\n\nSince the total number of balls the coach brought is equal to the total number of balls carried by the three boys, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{7J}{2} = \\text{Total number of balls} \\]\n\nGiven that Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, we can substitute \\( J = 2 \\) into the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{7 \\times 2}{2} = \\text{Total number of balls} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{14}{2} = \\text{Total number of balls} \\]\n\\[ 7 = \\text{Total number of balls} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.",
    "answer": "Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 balls.\nSince Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 ball.\nIn total, the three boys carried 4+2+1=<<4+2+1=7>>7 balls, which were all the balls the coach brought to practice.\n#### 7"
