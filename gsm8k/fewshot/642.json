    "question": "James buys a new wardrobe.  He buys 10 suits and 10 dress pants.  He also buys 3 dress shirts per suit.  The suits cost $750 each and the dress pants cost 1/5 that cost.  The dress shirts were $60 each.  How much did everything cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the suits:\n- James buys 10 suits.\n- Each suit costs $750.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the suits is:\n  \\[\n  10 \\times 750 = 7500 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants:\n- The dress pants cost \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the cost of one suit.\n- The cost of one suit is $750.\n- Therefore, the cost of one dress pant is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{750}{5} = 150 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- Since James buys 10 dress pants, the total cost for the dress pants is:\n  \\[\n  10 \\times 150 = 1500 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts:\n- Each dress shirt costs $60.\n- James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the dress shirts is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 60 = 180 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we sum up the costs of all the items:\n\\[\n7500 + 1500 + 180 = 9280 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost of everything is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9280}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The suits cost 750*10=$<<750*10=7500>>7500\nThe dress pants cost 750/5=$<<750/5=150>>150 each\nSo in total they cost 150*10=$<<150*10=1500>>1500\nHe bought 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 dress shirts\nso he spends 30*60=$<<30*60=1800>>1800 on dress shirts\nThus the total cost is 7500+1500+1800=$<<7500+1500+1800=10800>>10,800\n#### 10,800"
