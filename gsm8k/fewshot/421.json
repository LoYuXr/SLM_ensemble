    "question": "There were 50 cats on a rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, and later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. How many cats were left on the rock?",
    "completion": "To determine how many cats are left on the rock, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial number of cats**: There were 50 cats on the rock.\n\n2. **Cats carried away by the boats**: Four boats each carried away 5 cats. Therefore, the total number of cats carried away is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 5 = 20 \\text{ cats}\n   \\]\n   Subtracting the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats gives:\n   \\[\n   50 - 20 = 30 \\text{ cats}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cats that ran after the mouse**: Three-fifths of the remaining cats ran after a mouse they saw. First, calculate three-fifths of 30 cats:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{5} \\times 30 = 18 \\text{ cats}\n   \\]\n   Subtracting the number of cats that ran from the remaining cats gives:\n   \\[\n   30 - 18 = 12 \\text{ cats}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of cats left on the rock is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
    "answer": "When four boats carried away 5 cats each, the total number of cats that left the rock is 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20 cats.\nThe number of cats remaining on the rock became 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30.\nLater 3/5 of the remaining cats left the rock and ran after a mouse, a total of 3/5*30 = <<3/5*30=18>>18 cats.\nThe number of cats that remained on the rock is 30-18 = <<30-18=12>>12 cats\n#### 12"
