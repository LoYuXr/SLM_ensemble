    "question": "A bag of buttons had 21 buttons in it. Seven buttons had two holes and the rest had four holes. How many holes were in all the buttons in the bag?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of buttons with two holes.\n2. Identify the number of buttons with four holes.\n3. Calculate the total number of holes by adding the number of buttons with two holes to the number of buttons with four holes.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n- The number of buttons with two holes is 7.\n- The number of buttons with four holes is 21 - 7 = 14.\n\nNow, we add the number of buttons with two holes to the number of buttons with four holes:\n- Total number of holes = 7 (two-hole buttons) + 14 (four-hole buttons) = 21.\n\nTherefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is \\boxed{21}.",
    "answer": "There were 21 - 7 = <<21-7=14>>14 buttons with four holes.\nThe four-holed buttons had 14 * 4 = <<14*4=56>>56 holes.\nThe two-holed buttons had 7 * 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 holes.\nThus, there were 56 + 14 = <<56+14=70>>70 holes in all the buttons in the bag.\n#### 70"
