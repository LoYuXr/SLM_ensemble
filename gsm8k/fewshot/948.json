He gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times and an 8% commission on each of the Wall Street Journal. How much commission will he earn in total from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of Wall Street Journal if each costs $5 and $15 respectively?",
    "completion": "To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.\n2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.\n3. Sum the commissions from both newspapers.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the commission from the New York Times.**\n\nThe cost of one copy of the New York Times is $5. Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy sold. Therefore, the commission from one copy of the New York Times is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 0.10 = 0.50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFor 6 copies of the New York Times, the total commission is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 0.50 = 3.00 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.**\n\nThe cost of one copy of the Wall Street Journal is $15. Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy sold. Therefore, the commission from one copy of the Wall Street Journal is:\n\\[ 15 \\times 0.08 = 1.20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFor 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, the total commission is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 1.20 = 12.00 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Sum the commissions from both newspapers.**\n\nThe total commission from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal is:\n\\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:\n\\[ \\boxed{15.00} \\]",
    "answer": "He gets a commission of 10% on each copy of the New York Times so for 6 copies he will get 6*$5*(10/100) = $<<6*5*(10/100)=3>>3\nHe gets a commission of 8% on each copy of Wall Street Journal so for 10 copies he will get 10*$15*(8/100) = $<<10*15*8/100=12>>12\nHe will make a total commission of $3+$12 = $<<3+12=15>>15\n#### 15"
