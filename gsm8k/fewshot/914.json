    "question": "Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles.  He drives 100 miles a day for a 30 day month.  How many tune-ups does he need in that time?",
    "completion": "To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance Jon drives in a month.\n2. Determine how many tune-ups he needs based on the distance driven.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance Jon drives in a month. He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days:\n\n\\[\n100 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 3000 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many times he needs a tune-up based on the total distance driven. Since each tune-up is required every 1000 miles, we divide the total distance by 1000:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3000 \\text{ miles}}{1000 \\text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \\text{ tune-ups}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jon needs \\boxed{3} tune-ups in that time.",
    "answer": "He drives 100*30=<<100*30=3000>>3000 miles\nSo he needs 3000/1000=<<3000/1000=3>>3 tune-ups\n#### 3"
