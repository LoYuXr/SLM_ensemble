    "question": "John decides to get a loan by mortgaging his home.  His house is worth $250,000.  He gets a loan worth 40% of that.  He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts.  How much money did he have leftover after paying debt?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount John gets from the mortgage.\n2. Calculate the amount John uses to pay off his debts.\n3. Subtract the amount used to pay off his debts from the amount he gets from the mortgage.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The mortgage amount is 40% of the house's value. The house's value is $250,000.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mortgage amount} = 0.40 \\times 250,000 = 100,000\n   \\]\n\n2. John uses 60% of the mortgage amount to pay off his debts. So, we calculate 60% of $100,000.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 0.60 \\times 100,000 = 60,000\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we subtract the amount used to pay off his debts from the amount he gets from the mortgage to find out how much he has leftover.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts is \\(\\boxed{40000}\\).",
    "answer": "His loan is worth 250,000*.4=$<<250000*.4=100000>>100,000\nThat means he uses 100,000*.6=$<<100000*.6=60000>>60,000 to pay off debts\nSo he has 100,000-60,000=$<<100000-60000=40000>>40,000 leftover\n#### 40,000"
