    "question": "Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes.  Each box weighs 8 ounces. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce. If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, when there are 16 ounces to a pound?",
    "completion": "To determine the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of boxes:**\n   - Each box weighs 8 ounces.\n   - Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.\n   - Nik has 200 crayons.\n   - Therefore, the number of boxes is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{200 \\text{ crayons}}{1 \\text{ ounce/crayon}} = 200 \\text{ boxes}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**\n   - Each box weighs 8 ounces.\n   - There are 200 boxes.\n   - Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is:\n     \\[\n     200 \\text{ boxes} \\times 8 \\text{ ounces/box} = 1600 \\text{ ounces}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**\n   - There are 16 ounces in a pound.\n   - Therefore, the total weight in pounds is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1600 \\text{ ounces}}{16 \\text{ ounces/pound}} = 100 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) pounds.",
    "answer": "First find how many boxes Nik needs. 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = <<200/8=25>>25 boxes.\n25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = <<25*8=200>>200 ounces.\nEach crayon weighs 1 ounce, so 200 + 200 = <<200+200=400>>400 ounces.\n400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = <<400/16=25>>25 pounds.\n#### 25"
