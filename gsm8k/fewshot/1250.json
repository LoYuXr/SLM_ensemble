    "question": "Mitchell is making nachos for his family. He buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each. If his family has five members, how many chips does each person get if they all get the same number?",
    "completion": "To determine how many chips each person gets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of chips Mitchell has.\n2. Divide the total number of chips by the number of family members.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of chips. Mitchell buys two bags of chips, with each bag containing 55 chips. So, the total number of chips is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 55 = 110 \\text{ chips} \\]\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. Mitchell has 5 family members, so we divide 110 chips by 5:\n\\[ 110 \\div 5 = 22 \\]\n\nTherefore, each person gets \\(\\boxed{22}\\) chips.",
    "answer": "There are 110 chips because 2 x 55 = <<2*55=110>>110\nThey each get 22 chips because 110 / 5 = <<110/5=22>>22\n#### 22"
