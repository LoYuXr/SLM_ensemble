    "question": "If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. If he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. What will be the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options?",
    "completion": "To determine the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts every day, we need to calculate the weight loss and gain for each option over 5 weeks and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the weight loss for each option over 5 weeks:\n- If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he will lose 1.25 pounds/week. Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is:\n  \\[\n  1.25 \\text{ pounds/week} \\times 5 \\text{ weeks} = 6.25 \\text{ pounds}\n  \\]\n- If Martin eats donuts every day, he will gain 1.75 pounds/week. Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is:\n  \\[\n  1.75 \\text{ pounds/week} \\times 5 \\text{ weeks} = 8.75 \\text{ pounds}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two options:\n\\[\n6.25 \\text{ pounds} - 8.75 \\text{ pounds} = -2.50 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nThe difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is \\boxed{-2.50} pounds.",
    "answer": "First find the difference in weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds/week - ( -1.25 pounds/week) = 1.75 pounds/week + 1.25 pounds/week = <<1.75-(-1.25)=3>>3 pounds/week\nThen multiply the weight gain per week by the number of weeks to find the total difference at the end of 5 weeks: 5 weeks * 3 pounds/week = <<5*3=15>>15 pounds\n#### 15"
