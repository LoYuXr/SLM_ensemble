    "question": "James decided to walk to the store.  When he got halfway there he realized he forgot something at home and had to walk back.  If his home is 4 miles from the store and he walks 4 miles per hour how long did it take him to reach the store?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to consider the distance he walked and the speed at which he walked. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the total distance James walked:**\n   - The distance from James' home to the store is 4 miles.\n\n2. **Identify the distance James walked back:**\n   - James realized he forgot something at home and had to walk back 4 miles.\n\n3. **Calculate the total distance James walked:**\n   - Total distance = Distance to store + Distance back home\n   - Total distance = 4 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles\n\n4. **Determine the time taken to walk the total distance:**\n   - James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.\n   - Time = Distance / Speed\n   - Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours\n\nTherefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.",
    "answer": "He walked 4/2=<<4/2=2>>2 miles there before turning around\nSo in total he walked 2+2+4=<<2+2+4=8>>8 miles, he walked 2 miles to the halfway point than 2 miles home.\nThat means it took him 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 hours\n#### 2"
