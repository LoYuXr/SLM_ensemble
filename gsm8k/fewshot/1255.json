    "question": "Crista's plants need to be watered every day. She has 20 plants. 4 of her plants need half of a cup of water. 8 plants need 1 cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?",
    "completion": "To determine how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water each:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ plants} \\times 0.5 \\text{ cups/plant} = 2 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ plants} \\times 1 \\text{ cup/plant} = 8 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nNow, let's find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. Since there are 20 plants in total, the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ plants} - 4 \\text{ plants} - 8 \\text{ plants} = 6 \\text{ plants} \\]\n\nThe total amount of water needed for these 6 plants is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ plants} \\times 0.25 \\text{ cups/plant} = 1.5 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the amounts of water needed for all the plants to get the total amount of water needed per day:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ cups} + 8 \\text{ cups} + 1.5 \\text{ cups} = 11.5 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nTherefore, Crista needs \\(\\boxed{11.5}\\) cups of water every day for her plants.",
    "answer": "She will need 2 cups for the plants that need half of a cup of water because .5*4 = 2 cups\nShe will need 8 cups for the plants that need a cup of water because 1*8= <<1*8=8>>8 cups.\nSince she has 20 plants, 20-4-8=<<20-4-8=8>>8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water.\nSince 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, she will need 2 cups of water for these plants because .25*8=<<.25*8=2>>2 cups.\nIn total, she will need 2+8+2=<<2+8+2=12>>12 cups of water per day.\n#### 12"
