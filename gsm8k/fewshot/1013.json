    "question": "Janet gets a job as a waitress.  She makes $10 an hour from wages and another $15 an hour from tips.  She wants to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment.  If she works 40 hours a week how many weeks will she need to work to save the down payment?",
    "completion": "To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up $10000 for a downpayment, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Janet's total earnings from her job.\n2. Determine the amount she needs to save.\n3. Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save that amount.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Janet's total earnings from her job:\n- She makes $10 per hour and works 40 hours a week.\n- Therefore, her weekly earnings are \\(10 \\times 40 = 400\\) dollars.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much she needs to save:\n- The cost of the car is $10000.\n- She wants to save 20% of this amount.\n- Therefore, the amount she needs to save is \\(10000 \\times 0.20 = 2000\\) dollars.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000. We do this by dividing the amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:\n- The number of weeks she needs to work is \\(2000 \\div 400 = 5\\).\n\nSo, Janet needs to work for \\(\\boxed{5}\\) weeks to save the down payment.",
    "answer": "She makes 10+15=$<<10+15=25>>25 an hour from working\nThat means each week she makes 25*40=$<<25*40=1000>>1000\nShe wants to make 10000*.2=$<<10000*.2=2000>>2000\nSo she needs to work 2000/1000=<<2000/1000=2>>2 weeks\n#### 2"
