    "question": "90 single use contacts come in 1 box and will last Pete 45 days.  Each box is $100.00 and currently 10% off.  If he buys 2 boxes of contact, how much will each pair of contacts cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contact.\n2. Determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes.\n3. Calculate the cost per pair of contacts.\n\nFirst, let's find the total cost of 2 boxes of contact. Each box costs $100.00, so the cost for 2 boxes is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes. Since each box contains 90 single-use contacts, the total number of contacts is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 90 = 180 \\text{ contacts} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the cost per pair of contacts. Since each pair consists of 2 contacts, the cost per pair is:\n\\[ \\frac{200}{180} = \\frac{10}{9} \\approx 1.11 \\text{ dollars per pair} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{10}{9}} \\]",
    "answer": "Each box of contacts is $100.00 with 10% off so that's 100*.10 = $<<100*.10=10.00>>10.00 off\nSo the box was $100.00 and he has $10.00 off so each box will cost 100-10 = $<<100-10=90.00>>90.00\nHe buys 2 boxes and each box costs $90.00 so that's 2*90= $<<2*90=180.00>>180.00\n1 box of contacts has 90 contacts and he buys 2 boxes so that's 90*2 = <<90*2=180>>180 contacts\nHe needs 1 contact for each eye and he has 180 contacts so that's 180/2 = <<180/2=90>>90 pairs of contacts\nHe spent $180.00 to have 90 pairs of contacts so each pair of contacts costs 180/90 = $<<180/90=2.00>>2.00 a pair\n#### 2"
