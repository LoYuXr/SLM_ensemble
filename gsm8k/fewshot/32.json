    "question": "John takes care of 10 dogs.  Each dog takes .5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.  How many hours a week does he spend taking care of dogs?",
    "completion": "To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends walking and taking care of his dogs each day.\n2. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week to get the weekly total.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily total time spent on dogs:\n- Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.\n- John has 10 dogs.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Daily total time} = 10 \\text{ dogs} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours/dog} = 5 \\text{ hours/day}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours John spends on dogs each week:\n- There are 7 days in a week.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weekly total time} = 5 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 35 \\text{ hours/week}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, John spends \\boxed{35} hours a week taking care of his dogs.",
    "answer": "He spends 10*.5=<<10*.5=5>>5 hours per day\nThat means he spends 5*7=<<5*7=35>>35 hours per week\n#### 35"
