    "question": "Lisa and Peter are selling chocolate bars door to door. Lisa sold three and a half boxes of chocolate bars, and Peter sold four and a half boxes. They sold 64 chocolate bars together. How many chocolate bars are in a box?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of chocolate bars sold by Lisa and Peter.\n2. Determine the number of chocolate bars in a box.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of chocolate bars sold by Lisa and Peter together. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Therefore, the total number of boxes sold is:\n\\[ 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \\text{ boxes} \\]\n\nNext, we know that they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars together. Since each box contains the same number of chocolate bars, we can find the number of chocolate bars in a box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:\n\\[ \\frac{64}{8} = 8 \\text{ chocolate bars per box} \\]\n\nThus, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
    "answer": "Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.\nLisa sold 3 1/2 * B bars.\nPeter sold 4 1/2 * B bars.\nTogether, they sold 3 1/2 * B + 4 1/2 * B = 8B = 64 bars.\nTherefore, there are B = 64 / 8 = <<64/8=8>>8 chocolate bars in a box.\n#### 8"
