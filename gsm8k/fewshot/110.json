    "question": "Marcell and Beatrice are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Beatrice's was two roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long while Marcell's was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?",
    "completion": "To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them ate and then find the average of these totals.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of roll-ups Marcell ate:\n- Marcell's roll-up width is 3.\n- Marcell's roll-up length is 14.\n- Therefore, the total number of roll-ups Marcell ate is \\(3 \\times 14 = 42\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of roll-ups Beatrice ate:\n- Beatrice's roll-up width is 2.\n- Beatrice's roll-up length is 24.\n- Therefore, the total number of roll-ups Beatrice ate is \\(2 \\times 24 = 48\\).\n\nNow, we find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice by adding their individual totals:\n- Total roll-ups eaten by Marcell: 42\n- Total roll-ups eaten by Beatrice: 48\n- Therefore, the total number of roll-ups eaten by both is \\(42 + 48 = 90\\).\n\nFinally, we find the average number of roll-ups eaten by dividing the total number of roll-ups by 2:\n- Average number of roll-ups eaten: \\(\\frac{90}{2} = 45\\).\n\nThus, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
    "answer": "Beatrice ate 48 because 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.\nMarcell ate 42 because 14 x 3 = <<14*3=42>>42\nIn total they ate 90 because 48 + 42 = <<48+42=90>>90\nOn average they ate 45 because 90 / 2 = <<90/2=45>>45\n#### 45"
