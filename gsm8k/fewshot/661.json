    "question": "Roger goes to the store to buy some coffee.  The normal brand of coffee he buys cost $5 per pound.  He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out.  He decides to buy a week's worth of coffee and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day.  He also decided to buy himself a donut for $2.  How much did everything cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of Roger's purchases, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate the cost for each item separately.\n\n1. **Cost of the more expensive brand of coffee:**\n   - The normal brand costs $5 per pound.\n   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.\n   - Calculate 20% of $5:\n     \\[\n     0.20 \\times 5 = 1\n     \\]\n   - Add this amount to the normal brand price to find the cost of the more expensive brand:\n     \\[\n     5 + 1 = 6 \\text{ dollars per pound}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Total cost of coffee for a week:**\n   - Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds.\n   - Calculate the total cost for the coffee:\n     \\[\n     7 \\text{ pounds} \\times 6 \\text{ dollars per pound} = 42 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Cost of the donut:**\n   - The donut costs $2.\n\n4. **Total cost of everything:**\n   - Add the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut:\n     \\[\n     42 \\text{ dollars (coffee)} + 2 \\text{ dollars (donut)} = 44 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total cost of everything is \\(\\boxed{44}\\).",
    "answer": "The coffee he bought was 5*.2=$<<5*.2=1>>1 more expensive per pound than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 5+1=$<<5+1=6>>6 per pound\nHe goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 pounds of coffee a week\nSo he paid 6*7=$<<6*7=42>>42 on coffee\nThat means his total bill was 42+2=$<<42+2=44>>44\n#### 44"
