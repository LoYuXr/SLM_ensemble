    "question": "Two track teams are competing against each other in a 4 by 400 meter relay; a race where each competing team has four members that each run 400 meters, or one lap, around a standard track.  One of the two teams is very well-rounded and each of their members will run their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds.  The other team is less well-rounded; their first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.  Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?",
    "completion": "To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 400-meter relay race.\n\n### Team 1:\n- Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.\n- There are 4 members in the team.\n- Therefore, the total time for the team is \\( 4 \\times 55 = 220 \\) seconds.\n\n### Team 2:\n- The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.\n- Each subsequent runner runs 3 seconds less than the previous runner.\n- The first runner runs 60 seconds.\n- The second runner runs \\( 60 - 3 = 57 \\) seconds.\n- The third runner runs \\( 57 - 3 = 54 \\) seconds.\n- The fourth runner runs \\( 54 - 3 = 51 \\) seconds.\n\nTo find the total time for the team, we sum the times for each runner:\n\\[\n60 + 57 + 54 + 51\n\\]\n\nCalculating the sum:\n\\[\n60 + 57 = 117\n\\]\n\\[\n117 + 54 = 171\n\\]\n\\[\n171 + 51 = 222\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time for the team is 222 seconds.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe faster team (Team 1) will win by:\n\\[\n222 - 220 = 2 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the faster team will win by 2 seconds.",
    "answer": "The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.\nOn the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.\nThus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.\nTherefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.\n#### 2"
