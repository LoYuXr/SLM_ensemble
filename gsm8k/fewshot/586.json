    "question": "Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. How many ml of water does she need to drink?",
    "completion": "To determine how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total calories burned and then use that to find out how much water she needs to drink.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the calories burned from running:\n- Hannah runs for 1 hour, and the running burns 600 calories per hour.\n- Therefore, the total calories burned from running is:\n  \\[\n  600 \\text{ calories/hour} \\times 1 \\text{ hour} = 600 \\text{ calories}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the calories burned from aerobics:\n- Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics, and the aerobics burns 500 calories per hour.\n- Therefore, the total calories burned from aerobics is:\n  \\[\n  500 \\text{ calories/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 1000 \\text{ calories}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we add the calories burned from both activities to find the total calories burned:\n\\[\n600 \\text{ calories} + 1000 \\text{ calories} = 1600 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\nHannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. To find out how many milliliters of water she needs to drink, we divide the total calories burned by 200:\n\\[\n\\frac{1600 \\text{ calories}}{200 \\text{ calories/ml}} = 8 \\text{ ml}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Hannah needs to drink \\boxed{8} ml of water.",
    "answer": "First find the total calories burned on aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = <<2*500=1000>>1000 calories\nThen add the calories burned running to find the total calories burned: 600 calories + 1000 calories = <<600+1000=1600>>1600 calories\nFinally, divide that number by the ratio of calories burned to water drunk to find how many water Hannah needs to drink: 1600 calories * 100 ml/200 calories = <<1600*100/200=800>>800 ml\n#### 800"
