    "question": "A real estate agent has spent $5 on each newspaper ad and spent $75 on each television ad. He bought 50 newspaper ads and 15 television ads. How much did the real estate agent spend on buying all the ads?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:\n- The agent bought 50 newspaper ads.\n- Each newspaper ad costs $5.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the newspaper ads is:\n  \\[\n  50 \\text{ ads} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars/ad} = 250 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the television ads:\n- The agent bought 15 television ads.\n- Each television ad costs $75.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the television ads is:\n  \\[\n  15 \\text{ ads} \\times 75 \\text{ dollars/ad} = 1125 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:\n\\[\n250 \\text{ dollars} + 1125 \\text{ dollars} = 1375 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads is \\(\\boxed{1375}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "He spent a total of $5 x 50 = $<<5*50=250>>250 for the newspaper ads.\nHe spent a total of $75 x 15 = $<<75*15=1125>>1125 for the television ads.\nTherefore, the real estate agent spent $250 + $1125 = $<<250+1125=1375>>1375 on buying all the ads.\n#### 1375"
