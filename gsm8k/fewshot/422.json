    "question": "Bill is signing up for a new streaming service. He got a special introductory deal where the first 6 months were $8 a month, then it went up to the normal price of $12 a month. After 8 months of the normal rate, the service increased its price to $14 a month. How much do 2 years of the service cost him?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of the streaming service over 2 years, we need to break down the cost into three distinct periods: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the final 2 years.\n\n1. **First 6 months:**\n   - The initial rate is $8 per month.\n   - Cost for the first 6 months: \\( 6 \\text{ months} \\times \\$8/\\text{month} = \\$48 \\).\n\n2. **Next 8 months:**\n   - The rate increases to $12 per month after the first 6 months.\n   - Cost for the next 8 months: \\( 8 \\text{ months} \\times \\$12/\\text{month} = \\$96 \\).\n\n3. **Final 2 years:**\n   - The rate increases to $14 per month after the next 8 months.\n   - Cost for the final 2 years: \\( 2 \\text{ years} \\times \\$14/\\text{month} = \\$28 \\).\n\nNow, we sum up the costs from all three periods:\n\\[\n\\$48 + \\$96 + \\$28 = \\$162\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost of the streaming service over 2 years is \\(\\boxed{162}\\).",
    "answer": "There are 12 months in a year, so there are 2 years * 12 months per year = 24 months in 2 years.\nHe has 6 months at the special rate, followed by 8 months of the normal rate, so out of 24 months he pays the increased rate for 24 months - 6 months - 8 months = <<24-6-8=10>>10 months.\nHe pays the special rate of $8 a month for 6 months, or 6 months * $8 per month = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nHe pays the normal rate of $12 a month for 8 months, or 8 months * $12 per month = $<<8*12=96>>96.\nHe pays the new raised rate of $14 a month for 10 months, or 10 months * $14 per month = $<<10*14=140>>140.\nOver two years, he pays a total of $48 + $96 + $140 = $<<48+96+140=284>>284.\n#### 284"
