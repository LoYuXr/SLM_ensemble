    "question": "In a school activity, fifty-four students are to be separated into six groups of equal size. If the activity requires 12 groups, how many more groups are needed to form?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more groups are needed to form six groups of equal size, we start by calculating the total number of students required for six groups. Since each group should have 12 students, the total number of students is:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times 12 = 72 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many students are left after forming six groups. Since there are 54 students in total and 72 students are required, the number of students left is:\n\n\\[ 54 - 72 = -18 \\]\n\nSince the number of students left is negative, it means that 18 students are not enough to form six groups of 12 students each. Therefore, we need to determine how many more groups are needed to form six groups of 12 students each. We do this by dividing the number of students left by the number of students per group:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-18}{12} = -1.5 \\]\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the next whole number. This means we need 2 more groups to form six groups of 12 students each. Therefore, the number of additional groups needed is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",
    "answer": "There are 54/6 = <<54/6=9>>9 groups formed from the 54 students.\nSo, 12 - 9 = <<12-9=3>>3 groups more are needed to form.\n#### 3"
