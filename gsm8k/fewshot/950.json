    "question": "Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. How many points did Azibo score?",
    "completion": "To determine how many points Azibo scored, we start by defining the points scored by each person. Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \\( B \\), \\( A \\), and \\( D \\) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:\n\n1. Bahati scored the most points, so \\( B > A > D \\).\n2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so \\( B = A + 20 \\).\n3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so \\( B = D + 10 \\).\n\nWe can use these equations to express \\( A \\) and \\( D \\) in terms of \\( B \\):\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[ B = A + 20 \\]\n\\[ A = B - 20 \\]\n\nFrom the third equation:\n\\[ B = D + 10 \\]\n\\[ D = B - 10 \\]\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for \\( A \\) and \\( D \\) into the first equation:\n\\[ B = (B - 20) + 20 \\]\n\\[ B = B \\]\n\nThis equation is always true, so it doesn't provide new information. Instead, we can use the fact that \\( B = A + 20 \\) and \\( B = D + 10 \\) to find a consistent value for \\( B \\). Since \\( B \\) is the most points scored, we can assume \\( B \\) is the highest possible value that satisfies all the conditions. Let's solve for \\( B \\) by assuming \\( B \\) is the highest possible value that fits all the conditions.\n\nIf we assume \\( B \\) is the highest possible value, we can use the fact that \\( B \\) must be greater than both \\( A \\) and \\( D \\). Let's try to find a value for \\( B \\) that fits all the conditions. If we assume \\( B = 45 \\), then:\n\\[ A = B - 20 = 45 - 20 = 25 \\]\n\\[ D = B - 10 = 45 - 10 = 35 \\]\n\nWe need to check if these values satisfy all the conditions:\n1. Bahati scored 25 points, which is 20 more than Azibo.\n2. Bahati scored 45 points, which is 1",
    "answer": "Let B = the number of points Bahati scored\nAzibo = B - 20\nDinar = B - 10\nB + B -20 + B - 10 = 45\n3B - 30 = 45;\n3B = 75\nB = <<25=25>>25\nAzibo = 25 - 20 = <<25-20=5>>5 points\nAzibo scored 5 points.\n#### 5"
