    "question": "Louise is an artist and needs to apply a coat of varnish to her latest paintings. Usually it takes 7 minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting. However, today she is using a new varnish and it takes 12 minutes for the coat to dry. How much longer will it take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish?",
    "completion": "To determine how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the drying time for both varnishes and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the drying time for the old varnish:\n- The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting.\n- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \\(7 \\text{ minutes/painting} \\times 6 \\text{ paintings} = 42 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the drying time for the new varnish:\n- The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting.\n- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \\(12 \\text{ minutes/painting} \\times 6 \\text{ paintings} = 72 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\nNow, we find the difference in drying time between the new varnish and the old varnish:\n- The difference is \\(72 \\text{ minutes} - 42 \\text{ minutes} = 30 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\nTherefore, it will take \\(\\boxed{30}\\) minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.",
    "answer": "Usually, the varnish on all 6 paintings would be dry in 7*6=<<7*6=42>>42 minutes\nWith the new varnish, all 6 paintings would be dry in 12*6=<<6*12=72>>72 minutes\nWith the new varnish, it will take 72-42=<<72-42=30>>30 more minutes\n#### 30"
