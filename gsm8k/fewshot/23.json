    "question": "A candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour that it burns. How many centimeters shorter will a candle be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM?",
    "completion": "To determine how many centimeters shorter a candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time the candle burns.\n2. Determine the total length of the candle that melts.\n3. Subtract the length of the melted candle from the original length of the candle.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time the candle burns. The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.\n\nNext, we need to determine the total length of the candle that melts. The problem states that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. Therefore, in 4 hours, the candle will melt:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ cm/hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 8 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the length of the melted candle from the original length of the candle. The original length of the candle is not given, but we can assume it is 100 cm for the sake of this calculation. After burning for 4 hours, the length of the melted candle is 8 cm. Therefore, the length of the candle after burning is:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ cm} - 8 \\text{ cm} = 92 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nThe candle will be 92 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. So, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{92}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The candle burns for 5 - 1 = <<5-1=4>>4 hours.\nThus, the candle will be 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 centimeters shorter.\n#### 8"
