    "question": "Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. How load does it take to download the file?",
    "completion": "To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to account for the time spent during the restarts and the time spent downloading the file itself.\n\n1. **Calculate the time spent downloading the file:**\n   - Carla normally downloads at a rate of 2 GB/minute.\n   - The file size is 200 GB.\n   - Time to download the file: \\( \\frac{200 \\text{ GB}}{2 \\text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \\text{ minutes} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the time spent during the restarts:**\n   - Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes.\n   - Total time spent during restarts: 20 minutes.\n\n3. **Calculate the total time for the download:**\n   - Total time = Time to download the file + Time spent during restarts\n   - Total time = 100 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file is 120 minutes.",
    "answer": "First find how many gigabytes are in 40% of the file: 200 GB * 40% = <<200*40*.01=80>>80 GB\nThen divide that number by the download rate to find the time until Windows restarts: 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<80/2=40>>40 minutes\nThen find the time to download the whole file after the restart: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes\nThen add the time to download 40% of the file, to download the whole file, and to wait for Windows to update: 40 minutes + 100 minutes + 20 minutes = <<40+100+20=160>>160 minutes\n#### 160"
