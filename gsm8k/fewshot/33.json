    "question": "Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.\n\nLet \\( S \\) represent the number of silver coins Gretchen has. According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Therefore, the number of gold coins can be expressed as \\( S + 30 \\).\n\nWe are also given that the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110. This can be written as:\n\\[\nS + (S + 30) = 110\n\\]\n\nNext, we simplify and solve for \\( S \\):\n\\[\n2S + 30 = 110\n\\]\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n2S = 80\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nS = 40\n\\]\n\nNow that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30 to the number of silver coins:\n\\[\nS + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).",
    "answer": "Let x be the number of silver coins Gretchen has\nGretchen has x+30 gold coins.\nx+x+30=110\n2*x=80\nx=<<40=40>>40\nGretchen has 40+30=<<40+30=70>>70 gold coins\n#### 70"
