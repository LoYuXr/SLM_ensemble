    "question": "Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, how many fewer apples does Beck have than Boris now?",
    "completion": "To determine how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after Boris gives him 10 apples, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of apples Beck originally has:**\n   Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Beck's apples} = 100 - 23 = 77\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many apples Boris has after giving 10 apples to Beck:**\n   After giving 10 apples to Beck, Boris will have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Boris's apples} = 100 - 10 = 90\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the transaction:**\n   The difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck after the transaction is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 90 - 77 = 13\n   \\]\n\nThus, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has \\(\\boxed{13}\\) fewer apples than Boris.",
    "answer": "Boris has 100 apples, but gives 10 away, so now he has 100 apples - 10 apples = <<100-10=90>>90 apples.\nBeck has 23 fewer than Boris at the start, so he started with 100 - 23 = <<100-23=77>>77 apples.\nHowever, since he gets 10 from Boris, he now has 77 apples + 10 apples = <<77+10=87>>87 apples.\nThus Beck has 90 - 87 = <<90-87=3>>3 apples fewer than Boris.\n#### 3"
