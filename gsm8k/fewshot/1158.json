    "question": "The Hortex company produces bottled carrot juices. Every day it can produce 4200 bottles of these juices. Each juice can cover 20% of 1 person'ts daily energy demand. How many more bottles of juices would Hortex have to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total daily energy demand of 2300 people.\n2. Determine how many bottles of juice are needed to cover this energy demand.\n3. Calculate how many more bottles are needed to meet the energy demand.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total daily energy demand of 2300 people. Since each person's daily energy demand is 20% of their daily energy needs, we can express this as:\n\\[ \\text{Total daily energy demand} = 2300 \\times 0.20 = 460 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many bottles of juice are required to meet this energy demand. Since each bottle of juice covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we can express this as:\n\\[ \\text{Bottles of juice needed} = \\frac{460}{0.20} = 2300 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nHortex currently produces 4200 bottles of juice per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the number of bottles produced from the total number of bottles required:\n\\[ \\text{Additional bottles needed} = 2300 - 4200 = -1900 \\]\n\nSince the number of additional bottles needed is negative, it means that Hortex has already produced more than enough juice to meet the energy needs of 2300 people. In fact, Hortex has produced 1900 more bottles than needed.\n\nTherefore, the number of additional bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1900} \\]",
    "answer": "Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.\nSo 2300 people, need 5 * 2300 = <<2300*5=11500>>11500 juices for this purpose.\nTo cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles of juices.\n#### 7300"
