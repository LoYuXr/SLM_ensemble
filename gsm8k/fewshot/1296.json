    "question": "Ellen and her sister, Lani, went to the mall to buy presents for their mom. Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. Lani bought a pair of sunglasses at $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. How much did they spend in all?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchases and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the leggings:\n- Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100.\n- Lani bought a pair of leggings for $100.\n- Therefore, the total cost of the leggings is:\n  \\[\n  100 + 100 = 200\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the photo frame:\n- Ellen bought a photo frame for $5.\n- Lani bought a photo frame for $5.\n- Therefore, the total cost of the photo frame is:\n  \\[\n  5 + 5 = 10\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the two bathrobes:\n- Ellen bought two bathrobes at $100 each.\n- Lani bought two bathrobes at $100 each.\n- Therefore, the total cost of the two bathrobes is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 100 + 2 \\times 100 = 200 + 200 = 400\n  \\]\n\nFinally, let's sum up the total costs of all the items:\n- The total cost of the leggings is $200.\n- The total cost of the photo frame is $10.\n- The total cost of the two bathrobes is $400.\n- Therefore, the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani is:\n  \\[\n  200 + 10 + 400 = 610\n  \\]\n\nSo, the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani is \\(\\boxed{610}\\).",
    "answer": "Ellen spent $100 + $5 = $<<100+5=105>>105.\nTwo bathrobes cost 2 x $100 = $<<2*100=200>>200.\nSo, Lani spent $30 +$200 =$<<30+200=230>>230.\nTherefore, they spent $105 + $230 = $<<105+230=335>>335 in all.\n#### 335"
