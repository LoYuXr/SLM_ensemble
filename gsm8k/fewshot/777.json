    "question": "Mike decides he wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.  He has 600 movies.  A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  40% of the remaining movies are older movies which are $5.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of movies in series:**\n   Mike has 600 movies in total. A third of these movies are in series.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of series movies} = \\frac{600}{3} = 200\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of movies that are not in series:**\n   The remaining movies are not in series.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of non-series movies} = 600 - 200 = 400\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of older movies:**\n   40% of the remaining movies are older movies.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of older movies} = 0.40 \\times 400 = 160\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of the older movies:**\n   Each older movie costs $5.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of older movies} = 160 \\times 5 = 800\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total cost of the series movies:**\n   Each series movie costs $6.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of series movies} = 200 \\times 6 = 1200\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total cost of all movies:**\n   Add the total cost of the older movies and the total cost of the series movies.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of all movies} = 800 + 1200 = 2000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection is \\(\\boxed{2000}\\).",
    "answer": "There are 600/3=<<600/3=200>>200 movies in series\nSo he pays 200*6=$<<200*6=1200>>1200\nHe has 600-200=<<600-200=400>>400 movies not in series\n400*.4=<<400*.4=160>>160 movies are old\nSo those cost 160*5=$<<160*5=800>>800\n400-160=<<400-160=240>>240 movies are neither old nor in series\nThey cost 240*10=$<<240*10=2400>>2400\nSo the total cost is 1200+800+2400=$<<1200+800+2400=4400>>4400\n#### 4400"
