    "question": "A certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit. One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits. One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?",
    "completion": "To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of one banana. Since one banana costs twice as much as one apple, and one apple costs $0.5, the cost of one banana is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.5 = 1 \\text{ dollar} \\]\n\nNext, let's find the cost of one orange. Since oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana, the cost of one orange is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cost of one crate of fruit by summing the costs of the bananas, apples, and oranges:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ bananas} + 12 \\text{ apples} + 7 \\text{ oranges} = 5 + 12 + 7 = 24 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is:\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]",
    "answer": "The price for apples in the crate would be 12 * 0.5 = $<<12*0.5=6>>6.\nCost of banana is 0.5 * 2 = $<<0.5*2=1>>1.\nSo the bananas in this crate cost 5 * 1 = $<<5*1=5>>5.\nOne orange is three times more expensive than a banana, so it costs 1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.\nSo for the oranges in the crate, one needs to pay 7 * 3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.\nSo the whole crate costs 6 + 5 + 21 = $<<6+5+21=32>>32.\n#### 32"
