    "question": "A bumper car rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. The rink also has yellow cars.  If the rink has 75 cars in total how many yellow cars do they have?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of red cars:**\n   The rink has 12 red cars.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of green cars:**\n   The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of blue cars:**\n   The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \\times 10 = 30\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of cars:**\n   The total number of cars in the rink is given as 75.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of cars} = 12 \\text{ (red)} + 10 \\text{ (green)} + 30 \\text{ (blue)} + \\text{yellow cars} = 75\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the number of yellow cars:**\n   Subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30) = 75 - 52 = 23\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of yellow cars in the rink is \\(\\boxed{23}\\).",
    "answer": "The rink has 12-2= <<12-2=10>>10 green cars.\nThe rink has 10*3= <<10*3=30>>30 blue cars.\nThe rink has 12+10+30= <<12+10+30=52>>52 cars that are not yellow.\nThe rink has 75-52= <<75-52=23>>23 yellow cars.\n#### 23"
