    "question": "Nancy is cleaning out her old woodshed. She saw 90 spiders, 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and a number of stink bugs equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. How many bugs did she count total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of bugs Nancy counted, we need to calculate the number of each type of bug step by step.\n\n1. **Number of spiders:**\n   Nancy saw 90 spiders.\n\n2. **Number of millipedes:**\n   She saw \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) as many millipedes as spiders. Therefore, the number of millipedes is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 90 = 30\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of stink bugs:**\n   She saw twice the number of stink bugs as millipedes minus 12. Therefore, the number of stink bugs is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total number of bugs:**\n   To find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:\n   \\[\n   90 + 30 + 48 = 168\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is \\(\\boxed{168}\\).",
    "answer": "First find the number of millipedes: 90 spiders / 3 spiders/millipede = <<90/3=30>>30 millipedes\nThen multiply the number of millipedes by 2: 30 bugs * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 bugs\nThen subtract 12 to find the number of stink bugs: 60 bugs - 12 bugs = <<60-12=48>>48 bugs\nThen add the number of each kind of bug to find the total: 48 bugs + 30 bugs + 90 bugs = <<48+30+90=168>>168 bugs\n#### 168"
