    "question": "Tatiana is deciding how much of her weekend she wants to spend playing soccer. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. She is dividing her time between soccer, video games, and reading. If she reads for 3 hours and plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, what percentage of her weekend does she spend playing soccer?",
    "completion": "To determine the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time available for playing soccer.\n2. Determine the time spent playing video games.\n3. Calculate the remaining time after playing video games.\n4. Determine the time spent playing soccer.\n5. Convert the time spent playing soccer into a percentage of the total weekend time.\n\nLet's start with the total time available for playing soccer:\n- Saturday: 7 hours\n- Sunday: 5 hours\n- Total time for soccer: \\(7 + 5 = 12\\) hours\n\nNext, we calculate the time spent playing video games:\n- Video games: \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the remaining time\n- Remaining time after playing video games: \\(12 - 12 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 12 - 4 = 8\\) hours\n- Time spent playing video games: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 8 = \\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.67\\) hours\n\nNow, we calculate the time spent playing soccer:\n- Time spent playing soccer: \\(12 - 2.67 = 9.33\\) hours\n\nFinally, we convert the time spent playing soccer into a percentage of the total weekend time:\n- Percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer: \\(\\frac{9.33}{12} \\times 100 \\approx 79.42\\%\\)\n\nSo, the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer is \\(\\boxed{79.42}\\).",
    "answer": "She has 12 hours for her activities because 7 + 5 = <<7+5=12>>12\nAfter reading, she has 9 hours left because 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9\nShe spends 3 hours playing video games because 9 x (1/3) = <<9*(1/3)=3>>3\nAfter video games she has 6 hours left for soccer because 9 - 3 = <<6=6>>6\nThe proportion of time spend on soccer is .5 because 6 / 12 = <<6/12=.5>>.5\nThe percentage of time spent on soccer is 50 because .5 x 100 = <<50=50>>50\n#### 50"
