    "question": "Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays.  On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class.  How many hours a week did she have dance practice?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice in a week, we need to break down her practice schedule and calculate the total accordingly.\n\n1. **Dance practice on Tuesdays:**\n   - Hallie had 1 hour of dance practice on Tuesdays.\n\n2. **Dance practice on Thursdays:**\n   - Hallie had 2 hours of dance practice on Thursdays.\n\n3. **Dance practice on Saturdays:**\n   - Hallie had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class. Since Tuesday's night class was 1 hour, the Saturday's dance practice would be:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 1 = 2 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's sum up the hours from all the days:\n\n- Tuesday: 1 hour\n- Thursday: 2 hours\n- Saturday: 2 hours\n\nTotal hours in a week:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, Hallie had dance practice for a total of 5 hours in a week.",
    "answer": "She had practice for 1 hour on Tuesday and 2 hours on Thursday so she practiced for 1+2 = <<1+2=3>>3 hours\nSaturday's class was twice as long as Tuesday's so she danced 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 hours on Saturday\nIn one week she danced 3 hours on the weekdays and 2 hours on the weekend for a total of 3+2 = <<3+2=5>>5 hours\n#### 5"
