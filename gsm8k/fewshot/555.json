    "question": "John plans to save money from working.  He gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week.  If he wants to save $80 how many weeks will it take him?",
    "completion": "To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate John's weekly earnings.\n2. Determine how many weeks it will take him to save $80.\n\nFirst, let's calculate John's weekly earnings. John gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. So, his weekly earnings are:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 5 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days/week} = 40 \\text{ dollars/week} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80. We do this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:\n\\[ \\frac{80 \\text{ dollars}}{40 \\text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take John \\(\\boxed{2}\\) weeks to save $80.",
    "answer": "He gets paid 2*5=$<<2*5=10>>10 a day.\nSo he gets paid 10*4=$<<10*4=40>>40 a week.\nThat means it would take 80/40=<<80/40=2>>2 weeks to save up the money.\n#### 2"
