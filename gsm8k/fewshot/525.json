    "question": "Heather bought a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups of raisins in it. She wants to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix with the raisins. A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. How many batches of oatmeal cookies can Heather make if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix?",
    "completion": "To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of batches of oatmeal cookies that can be made:**\n   - Heather has 27 cups of raisins.\n   - Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) cup of raisins.\n   - To find out how many batches she can make, we divide the total number of raisins by the number of raisins needed per batch:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{27}{\\frac{3}{4}} = 27 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 9 \\times 4 = 36\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies.\n\n2. **Determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made from the 27 cups of raisins:**\n   - Since each batch requires \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) cup of raisins, we divide the total number of raisins by the number of raisins needed per batch:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{27}{\\frac{3}{4}} = 27 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 9 \\times 4 = 36\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies.\n\nThus, the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
    "answer": "Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.\nThus, she will be able to make (9/3) * 4 = <<9/3*4=12>>12 batches of oatmeal cookies.\n#### 12"
