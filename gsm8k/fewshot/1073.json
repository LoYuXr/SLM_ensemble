    "question": "Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. One monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?",
    "completion": "To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week:**\n   - Each monkey eats 10 bananas per day.\n   - There are 3 monkeys.\n   - Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ monkeys} \\times 10 \\text{ bananas/monkey/day} = 30 \\text{ bananas/week}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of bananas left for the third monkey:**\n   - Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas in total.\n   - The first two monkeys eat 30 bananas in a week.\n   - Therefore, the number of bananas left for the third monkey is:\n     \\[\n     315 \\text{ bananas} - 30 \\text{ bananas} = 285 \\text{ bananas}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of bananas eaten by the second monkey:**\n   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of bananas eaten by the first monkey.\n   - Then, the second monkey eats \\( x + 4 \\) bananas.\n   - The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is:\n     \\[\n     x + (x + 4) = 30\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     2x + 4 = 30\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     2x = 26 \\implies x = 13\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the first monkey eats 13 bananas.\n   - The second monkey eats:\n     \\[\n     13 + 4 = 17 \\text{ bananas}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey:**\n   - The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.\n   - The total number of bananas left for the third monkey is 285.\n   - The number of bananas eaten by the third monkey is:\n     \\[\n     285 - 17 = 268 \\text{ bananas}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the third monkey eats \\(\\boxed{268}\\)",
    "answer": "Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.\nThe second monkey eats 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 bananas a day.\nSo the first and the second monkey eat a total of 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 bananas each day.\nHence, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = <<45-24=21>>21 bananas each day.\n#### 21"
