    "question": "Walter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well. How much is Walter's lawyer going to contribute?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Walter has already collected.\n2. Determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Walter has already collected:\n- From his neighbors: $500\n- From the online fund: $1500\n- Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000\n\nNext, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, the lawyer will donate:\n\\[ 3 \\times 2000 = 6000 \\]\n\nTherefore, Walter's lawyer will contribute \\(\\boxed{6000}\\).",
    "answer": "Walter collects $500 + $1500 + $200 = $<<500+1500+200=2200>>2,200 he collects from everyone for charity.\nHis lawyer has offered to donate 3 times that amount, $2,200 x 3 = $<<3*2200=6600>>6,600 that Walter's lawyer is going to donate.\n#### 6,600"
