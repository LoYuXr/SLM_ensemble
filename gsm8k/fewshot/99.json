    "question": "Mary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary remain with?",
    "completion": "To determine how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has.\n2. Determine the total number of potted plants she will give to friends and family.\n3. Subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants she already has.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ potted plants/ledge} \\times 40 \\text{ leds} = 80 \\text{ potted plants} \\]\n\nNext, let's determine the total number of potted plants she will give to friends and family:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ potted plant/ledge} \\times 40 \\text{ leds} = 40 \\text{ potted plants} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants she already has:\n\\[ 80 \\text{ potted plants} - 40 \\text{ potted plants} = 40 \\text{ potted plants} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",
    "answer": "Yesterday, before receiving the plants, Mary had 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 18 plants, she therefore had a total of 80 + 18 = <<80+18=98>>98 potted plants\nTomorrow, Mary\u2019s plant giveaway will be 40 *1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 98 - 40 = <<98-40=58>>58 potted plants.\n#### 58"
