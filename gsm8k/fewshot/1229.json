    "question": "In November, a toy was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. In January, the price decreased by 50%. What was the price of the toy after it was discounted in January?",
    "completion": "To determine the price of the toy after it was discounted in January, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the price of the toy in December.\n2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after the discount.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the price of the toy in December.**\n\nThe price of the toy in November was $40. The price increased by 80% in December. To find the new price, we need to calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.\n\n\\[ \\text{Increase} = 40 \\times \\frac{80}{100} = 40 \\times 0.8 = 32 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72 \\]\n\nSo, the price of the toy in December was $72.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the price of the toy in January after the discount.**\n\nThe price of the toy in January was $72. The price decreased by 50% in January. To find the new price, we need to calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the original price.\n\n\\[ \\text{Decrease} = 72 \\times \\frac{50}{100} = 72 \\times 0.5 = 36 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36 \\]\n\nSo, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January was $36.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
    "answer": "In November, the toy's price was $<<40=40>>40.\nThe 80% increment represents 40*0.8=$32\nIn December, the toy's price was 40 + 32 = $<<40+32=72>>72.\nThe 50% increment from January represents 72*0.5=<<72*0.5=36>>36\nIn January, the toy's price is 72 - 36 = $<<72-36=36>>36.\n#### 36"
