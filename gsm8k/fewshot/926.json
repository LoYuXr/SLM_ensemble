    "question": "Colby loves going to the movies and every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies. Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10. Tickets for any other day cost $7. Popcorn costs $8 and boxes of candy cost $2. It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday. He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. How many movies can he see if he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month?",
    "completion": "To determine how many movies Colby can see in the last month, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and then figure out how many movies he can afford with that money.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has:\n- He gets $150 every month.\n- He has already spent $10 on tickets on Fridays and Saturdays, and $7 on popcorn and candy on other days.\n- He has 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy.\n\nThe total amount of money he has is:\n\\[ 150 + 10 + 7 + 2 \\times 2 + 4 \\times 4 = 150 + 10 + 7 + 4 + 16 = 189 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many movies he can see with $189. Since each movie costs $10, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one movie:\n\\[ \\frac{189}{10} = 18.9 \\]\n\nSince he can't see a fraction of a movie, we take the integer part of the division, which is 18. Therefore, Colby can see 18 movies in the last month.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{18}\n\\]",
    "answer": "He has spent $50 on Fri/Sat movies because 5 x 10 = <<50=50>>50\nHe has spent $56 on movies the rest of the day because 8 x 7 = <<8*7=56>>56\nHe has spent $16 on popcorn because 2 x 8 = <<16=16>>16\nHe has spent $8 on candy because 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8\nHe has spent 130 in total because 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = <<50+56+16+8=130>>130\nHe plans to spend $10 on popcorn and candy because 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10\nHe has $10 left to spend because 150 - 130 - 10 = <<150-130-10=10>>10\nHe can see 1 movie because 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1\n#### 1"
