    "question": "Stanley was standing on the side of the mountain, at an elevation of 10,000 feet, when a gust air blew the comb out of his pocket, causing the comb to fall 4,000 feet to a ledge below.  Stanley's brother, Oliver, was also on the mountain, but he was at an elevation of 3,000 feet.  Stanley called Oliver on his cellphone and asked Oliver to find Stanley's comb.  How many feet must Oliver climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb?",
    "completion": "To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet.\n2. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet.\n3. The comb falls 4,000 feet to a ledge below.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total distance Stanley's comb must travel to reach the ledge:\n\\[ 10,000 \\text{ feet} - 4,000 \\text{ feet} = 6,000 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how much distance Oliver needs to climb to reach the same elevation of 6,000 feet. Since Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet, we subtract this from the total distance:\n\\[ 6,000 \\text{ feet} - 3,000 \\text{ feet} = 3,000 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nTherefore, Oliver must climb \\(\\boxed{3000}\\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.",
    "answer": "The elevation of Stanley's comb was 10,000 - 4,000 = <<10000-4000=6000>>6,000 feet.\nThus Oliver, who was at an elevation of 3,000 feet, must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = <<6000-3000=3000>>3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.\n#### 3000"
