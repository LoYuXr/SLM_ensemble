    "question": "Katina has $3000 in her savings account. If she removes $100 from the account every month, how much money will be remaining within the account after 2 years?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount removed from her account over that period and subtract it from the initial amount.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of months in 2 years:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ years} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 24 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount removed from the account over these 24 months. Katina removes $100 from the account each month:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 24 \\text{ months} = 2400 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:\n\\[ 3000 \\text{ dollars} - 2400 \\text{ dollars} = 600 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money remaining in the account after 2 years is:\n\\[ \\boxed{600} \\]",
    "answer": "A year has 12 months, and since she withdraws money from the account every month, after 2 years, she will have withdrawn money for 2*12= <<24=24>>24 months.\nSince she withdraws money from the account every month, after 24 months, she would have withdrawn 24*$100 = $<<24*100=2400>>2400.\nThe total amount of money remaining in the account after two years is $3000-$2400= $<<3000-2400=600>>600\n#### 600"
