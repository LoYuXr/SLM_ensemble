    "question": "Martha is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of them. It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a hat, 4 for a scarf, 12 for a sweater, 1 for a pair of mittens, and 2 for a pair of socks. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs to buy, we need to calculate the number of each type of item required and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Hat:**\n   - Each child needs one hat.\n   - Total hats needed: \\( 3 \\)\n\n2. **Scarves:**\n   - Each child needs one scarf.\n   - Total scarves needed: \\( 3 \\)\n\n3. **Sweaters:**\n   - Each child needs one sweater.\n   - Total sweaters needed: \\( 3 \\)\n\n4. **Mittens:**\n   - Each child needs one pair of mittens.\n   - Total mittens needed: \\( 3 \\)\n\n5. **Socks:**\n   - Each child needs one pair of socks.\n   - Total socks needed: \\( 3 \\)\n\nNow, we sum up the total number of skeins of wool needed:\n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ (hats)} + 3 \\text{ (scarves)} + 3 \\text{ (sweaters)} + 3 \\text{ (mittens)} + 3 \\text{ (socks)} = 14\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Martha will need to buy a total of 14 skeins of wool.",
    "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 2 skeins per hat + 4 skeins per scarf + 12 skeins per sweater + 1 skein per pair of mittens + 2 skeins per pair of socks = <<2+4+12+1+2=21>>21 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3 * 21 = <<3*21=63>>63 skeins of wool.\n#### 63"
