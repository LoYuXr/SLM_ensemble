    "question": "James is in charge of running messages from the office to each teacher's classroom. If he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson and 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu, how many messages does he deliver total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages delivered to each teacher and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we know that James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. Let's denote the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 66 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{66}{3} = 22 \\]\n\nSo, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu. To find the total number of messages delivered, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:\n\n\\[ 66 + 22 = 88 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of messages James delivers is \\(\\boxed{88}\\).",
    "answer": "First find the number of messages Mr. Yu gets: 66 messages / 3 = <<66/3=22>>22 messages\nThen add that to the number of messages Ms. Thompson gets to find the total: 66 messages + 22 messages = <<66+22=88>>88 messages\n#### 88"
