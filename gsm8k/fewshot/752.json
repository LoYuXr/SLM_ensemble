    "question": "Jenna has 4 roommates. Each month the electricity bill is $100. How much will each roommate pay per year for electricity, if they divide the share equally?",
    "completion": "To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total monthly electricity bill for all roommates.\n2. Determine the total annual electricity bill for all roommates.\n3. Divide the total annual electricity bill by the number of roommates to find the monthly share.\n4. Divide the monthly share by the number of roommates to find the annual share.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the total monthly electricity bill for all roommates:**\n   Jenna has 4 roommates, and each month the electricity bill is $100.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total monthly bill} = 4 \\times 100 = 400 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total annual electricity bill for all roommates:**\n   There are 12 months in a year.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total annual bill} = 400 \\times 12 = 4800 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide the total annual electricity bill by the number of roommates to find the monthly share:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly share} = \\frac{4800}{4} = 1200 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Divide the monthly share by the number of roommates to find the annual share:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual share} = \\frac{1200}{4} = 300 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each roommate will pay \\(\\boxed{300}\\) dollars per year for electricity.",
    "answer": "There are 12 months in a year, so the total electricity for the year will cost 100*12 =$<<100*12=1200>>1200.\nSince there are 5 roommates, each roommate will pay 1200/5=$<<1200/5=240>>240 in a year.\n#### 240"
