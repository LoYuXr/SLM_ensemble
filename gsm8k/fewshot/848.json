    "question": "A clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Half of the white shirts have collars, and 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. How many more floral shirts with no buttons are there than white shirts with no collars?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of white shirts with no collars.\n2. Calculate the number of floral shirts with no buttons.\n3. Find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of white shirts with no collars} = \\frac{40}{2} = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of floral shirts with no buttons. Since 20 of the floral shirts have buttons, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of floral shirts with no buttons} = 20\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 20 - 20 = 0\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are \\(\\boxed{0}\\) more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.",
    "answer": "40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 white shirts have no collars.\n50 - 20 = <<50-20=30>>30 floral shirts have no buttons.\nThere are 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.\n#### 10"
