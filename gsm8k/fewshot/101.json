    "question": "Solo has to read 4 pages from his Science textbook, 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook, 7 pages from his History textbook and 8 pages from his Geography textbook. Solo read 15 pages on Monday. If he has 4  more days to complete all his reading, how many pages does he need to read, on average, in one day?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pages Solo needs to read on average in one day, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he has already read and then find out how many pages he still needs to read.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pages Solo has already read:**\n   - Science textbook: 4 pages\n   - Social Studies textbook: 20 pages\n   - History textbook: 7 pages\n   - Geography textbook: 8 pages\n   - Total pages read: \\(4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49\\) pages\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of pages he needs to read:**\n   - Total pages to read: 49 pages\n\n3. **Calculate the number of days he has left to complete his reading:**\n   - Total days left: 4 days\n\n4. **Calculate the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day:**\n   - Average pages per day: \\(\\frac{49 \\text{ pages}}{4 \\text{ days}} = 12.25 \\text{ pages/day}\\)\n\nTherefore, on average, Solo needs to read \\(\\boxed{12.25}\\) pages per day.",
    "answer": "Solo has to read a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = <<4+20+7+8=39>>39 pages.\nAfter Monday, he had a remainder of 39 - 15 = <<39-15=24>>24 pages to read.\nTo complete his reading, he must read 24/4 = <<24/4=6>>6 pages a day.\n#### 6"
