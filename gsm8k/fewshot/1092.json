    "question": "A Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of a small triceratops it had hunted. When it left, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. A group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. How many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate?",
    "completion": "To determine how many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate, we need to work backwards from the information given.\n\n1. **Identify the final amount of meat left:**\n   - A group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat.\n\n2. **Determine the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate:**\n   - The Allosaurus left 270 kilograms of meat, so the meat left before the Allosaurus ate was:\n     \\[\n     270 \\text{ kg} + 270 \\text{ kg} = 540 \\text{ kg}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate:**\n   - The T-Rex ate half of the meat left after the Allosaurus ate:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{540 \\text{ kg}}{2} = 270 \\text{ kg}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the meat left before the T-Rex ate was:\n     \\[\n     270 \\text{ kg} + 270 \\text{ kg} = 540 \\text{ kg}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate the half it had eaten:**\n   - The T-Rex ate half of the meat left after the Allosaurus ate:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{540 \\text{ kg}}{2} = 270 \\text{ kg}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the meat left before the T-Rex ate was:\n     \\[\n     270 \\text{ kg} + 270 \\text{ kg} = 540 \\text{ kg}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was \\(\\boxed{540}\\) kilograms.",
    "answer": "The velociraptors left half for the Allosaurus, so the T-Rex left 2 * 270 = <<2*270=540>>540 kilograms of meat.\nThe T-Rex ate half the meat, so there were 540 * 2 = <<540*2=1080>>1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops.\n#### 1080"
