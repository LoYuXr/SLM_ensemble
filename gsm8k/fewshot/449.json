    "question": "Beatrice bought ten packets of crayons for her Art class. Six of the packets had eight pieces of colors each, and the other four packets had sixteen pieces of colors each. How many colors of crayons did Beatrice buy in all?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in each group and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of crayons in the six packets that each have eight pieces of colors:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ packets} \\times 8 \\text{ crayons per packet} = 48 \\text{ crayons} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of crayons in the four packets that each have sixteen pieces of colors:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ packets} \\times 16 \\text{ crayons per packet} = 64 \\text{ crayons} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of crayons from both groups to find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought:\n\\[ 48 \\text{ crayons} + 64 \\text{ crayons} = 112 \\text{ crayons} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is \\(\\boxed{112}\\).",
    "answer": "Six packets had 6 x 8 = <<6*8=48>>48 colors of crayons.\nFour packets had 4 x 16 = <<4*16=64>>64 colors of crayons.\nTherefore, Beatrice bought 48 + 64 = <<48+64=112>>112 colors of crayons in all.\n#### 112"
