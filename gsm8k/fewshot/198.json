    "question": "Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Initial number of cards:**\n   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.\n\n2. **Cards collected in the first month:**\n   She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 20 = 60\n   \\]\n   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.\n\n3. **Cards collected in the second month:**\n   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.\n   \\[\n   60 - 20 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.\n\n4. **Cards collected in the third month:**\n   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times (60 + 40) = 2 \\times 100 = 200\n   \\]\n   So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.\n\n5. **Total number of cards now:**\n   We sum the cards collected in each month.\n   \\[\n   20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is \\(\\boxed{320}\\).",
    "answer": "In the first month, Elaine collected 3*20= <<3*20=60>>60 pokemon cards.\nIn the second month, she collected 60-20 = <<60-20=40>>40 cards.\nAfter the two months, the new pokemon cards she'd collected is 40+60 = <<40+60=100>>100\nThe number of cards in the third month is twice the combined number in the first and second month, which totals 2*100 = <<2*100=200>>200 pokemon cards.\nIn total, Elaine has 20 cards she initially had+100 cards collected in the first and second month +200 cards collected in the third month = <<20+100+200=320>>320 cards\n#### 320"
