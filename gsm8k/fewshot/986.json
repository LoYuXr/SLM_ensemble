    "question": "Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill.  In each basket she wants to add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.  The petunias cost $3.00 apiece and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 apiece.  How much will she spend filling all 5 hanging baskets?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the petunias:\n- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias to each basket.\n- There are 5 baskets.\n- Therefore, the total number of petunias needed is \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\).\n- Each petunia costs $3.00.\n- The total cost for the petunias is \\(15 \\times 3 = 45\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines:\n- Katherine wants to add 2 sweet potato vines to each basket.\n- There are 5 baskets.\n- Therefore, the total number of sweet potato vines needed is \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\).\n- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.\n- The total cost for the sweet potato vines is \\(10 \\times 2.50 = 25\\) dollars.\n\nNow, we sum the costs of the petunias and the sweet potato vines to find the total amount Katherine will spend:\n- The total cost is \\(45 + 25 = 70\\) dollars.\n\nThus, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).",
    "answer": "The petunia are $3.00 each and she wants 3 per basket so that's 3.00*3 = $<<3*3=9.00>>9.00\nThe sweet potato vines are $2.50 each and she wants 2 per basket so that's 2.5*2 = $<<2.5*2=5.00>>5.00\nFor 1 basket, the petunias will cost $9.00 and the sweet potato vines will cost $5.00 for a total of 9+5 = $<<9+5=14.00>>14.00\nEach basket will cost $14.00 to fill and she needs to fill 5 baskets for a total of 14*5 = $<<14*5=70.00>>70.00\n#### 70"
