    "question": "Richard lives in an apartment building with 15 floors. Each floor contains 8 units, and 3/4 of the building is occupied. What's the total number of unoccupied units In the building?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.\n2. Determine the number of occupied units.\n3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of units in the building:\n   - Each floor has 8 units.\n   - There are 15 floors in the building.\n   - Therefore, the total number of units is \\( 8 \\times 15 = 120 \\).\n\n2. Determine the number of occupied units:\n   - 3/4 of the building is occupied.\n   - The number of occupied units is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 120 = 90 \\).\n\n3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:\n   - The number of unoccupied units is \\( 120 - 90 = 30 \\).\n\nThus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
    "answer": "The total number of units in the building will be 8 units/floor * 15 floors = <<8*15=120>>120 units.\nIf 3/4 of the building is occupied, then the total number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 units = <<3/4*120=90>>90 units.\nThe total number of unoccupied units is 120 units - 90 units = <<120-90=30>>30 units.\n#### 30"
