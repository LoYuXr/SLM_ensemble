    "question": "Marcus ordered 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece, 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, 3 mini quiches for $4.00 apiece and 13 blueberry muffins that were $1.00 apiece.  At check out, Marcus shows his loyalty card that gives him 10% off of his purchase.  What is Marcus' total bill?",
    "completion": "To calculate Marcus' total bill after applying the 10% loyalty card discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of each type of item.\n2. Sum up the total cost of all items.\n3. Apply the 10% loyalty card discount to the total cost.\n4. Calculate the final total bill.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Total cost of each type of item:**\n   - Croissants: \\(5 \\times 3.00 = 15.00\\)\n   - Cinnamon rolls: \\(4 \\times 2.50 = 10.00\\)\n   - Mini quiches: \\(3 \\times 4.00 = 12.00\\)\n   - Blueberry muffins: \\(13 \\times 1.00 = 13.00\\)\n\n2. **Sum up the total cost:**\n   \\[\n   15.00 + 10.00 + 12.00 + 13.00 = 50.00\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply the 10% loyalty card discount:**\n   \\[\n   50.00 \\times 0.10 = 5.00\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the final total bill:**\n   \\[\n   50.00 - 5.00 = 45.00\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Marcus' total bill after applying the 10% loyalty card discount is $45.00.",
    "answer": "5 croissants cost $3.00 each so they cost 5*3 = $<<5*3=15.00>>15.00\n4 cinnamon rolls cost $2.50 each so they cost 4*2.5 =$<<4*2.5=10.00>>10.00\n3 mini quiches cost $4.00 each so they cost 3*4 = $<<3*4=12.00>>12.00\n13 blueberry muffins cost $1.00 each so the cost 13*1 = $<<13*1=13.00>>13.00\nAll total, his pastries costs 15+10+12+13 = $<<15+10+12+13=50.00>>50.00\nHis has a 10% coupon for his $50.00 purchase so that saves him .10*50 = $<<10*.01*50=5.00>>5.00\nHis total bill is $50 minus his discount of $5.00 so 50-5 = $<<50-5=45.00>>45.00\n#### 45"
