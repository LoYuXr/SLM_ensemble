    "question": "Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each, a zebra with 36 stripes, and another zebra with half that many stripes. How many stripes do the zebras have on average?",
    "completion": "To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of stripes on the first two zebras.\n2. Add the number of stripes on the third zebra to the total from the first two zebras.\n3. Divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras to find the average.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\nThe first zebra has 17 stripes. The second zebra has 36 stripes. So, the total number of stripes on the first two zebras is:\n\\[ 17 + 36 = 53 \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of stripes on the third zebra, which is half of the number of stripes on the second zebra:\n\\[ \\frac{36}{2} = 18 \\]\n\nNow, we add the total number of stripes from the first two zebras and the third zebra to find the total number of stripes:\n\\[ 53 + 18 = 71 \\]\n\nFinally, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras to find the average:\n\\[ \\frac{71}{3} \\approx 23.67 \\]\n\nSo, the average number of stripes on the zebras is:\n\\[ \\boxed{23.67} \\]",
    "answer": "First find the number of stripes the last zebra has: 36 stripes / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 stripes\nThen find the total number of stripes the first two zebras have: 2 zebras * 17 stripes/zebra = <<2*17=34>>34 stripes\nThen add the number of stripes the last two zebras have: 18 stripes + 34 stripes + 36 stripes = <<18+34+36=88>>88 stripes\nThen divide the number of stripes by the number of zebras to find the average number of stripes per zebra: 88 stripes / 4 zebras = <<88/4=22>>22 stripes/zebra\n#### 22"
