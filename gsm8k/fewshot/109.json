    "question": "A local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon.  An app company is offering $.20 cashback per gallon if you fill up at this station.  If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, how much with their gas be, after the cashback rewards?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of 10 gallons of gas after applying the cashback, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost without cashback:**\n   The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 per gallon. Therefore, the cost for 10 gallons is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ gallons} \\times \\$3.00 \\text{ per gallon} = \\$30.00\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the cashback:**\n   The app company offers a cashback of $0.20 per gallon. For 10 gallons, the cashback is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ gallons} \\times \\$0.20 \\text{ per gallon} = \\$2.00\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost after cashback:**\n   Subtract the cashback from the total cost without cashback:\n   \\[\n   \\$30.00 - \\$2.00 = \\$28.00\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total cost of 10 gallons of gas after applying the cashback is \\(\\boxed{28.00}\\).",
    "answer": "Gas is $3.00 a gallon and they buy 10 gallons of gas so that's 3*10 = $<<3*10=30.00>>30.00\nThe app is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon and they buy 10 gallons so that's .20*10 = $<<0.20*10=2.00>>2.00\nThey spent $30.00 on gas and their app is offering them $2.00 cashback so they spent 30-2 = $<<30-2=28.00>>28.00 per gallon\n#### 28"
