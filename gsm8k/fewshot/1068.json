    "question": "One meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.  Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. Then Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.  How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the number of meatballs in the initial order:**\n   Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. Therefore, the number of meatballs in the initial order is:\n   \\[\n   10 - 3 = 7\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of meatballs in the sandwiches ordered by Mark:**\n   Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Since each sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the number of meatballs in the sandwiches ordered by Mark is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 4 = 16\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches:**\n   After Mark ate the sandwiches, the number of meatballs left in the remaining sub sandwiches is:\n   \\[\n   7 - 16 = -9\n   \\]\n   However, since it's not possible to have a negative number of meatballs, it means that the number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is zero. This is because the total number of meatballs in the initial order is 7, and after Mark ate 4 of them, there are no meatballs left.\n\nTherefore, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",
    "answer": "3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches is 10-3=<<10-3=7>>7 sub sandwiches.\nAfter Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, 7-4=<<7-4=3>>3 remained.\nFinally, after Sidney ordered three more sub sandwiches, there were a total of 3+3=<<3+3=6>>6 sub sandwiches.\nIf each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs, then the remaining sub sandwiches contain a total of 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24 meatballs.\n#### 24"
