    "question": "Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each and 60 cupcakes for $4 each. She gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her. How much money does she have left from her earnings?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Suzanne has left from her earnings, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total earnings from selling cookies.\n2. Calculate the total earnings from selling cupcakes.\n3. Add the earnings from cookies and cupcakes to find the total earnings.\n4. Subtract the amount given to her two sisters from the total earnings to find out how much money she has left.\n\nLet's start with the cookies:\nSuzanne sold 80 cookies at $1 each.\nTotal earnings from cookies = 80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80.\n\nNext, let's calculate the earnings from cupcakes:\nSuzanne sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each.\nTotal earnings from cupcakes = 60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240.\n\nNow, let's find the total earnings:\nTotal earnings = Earnings from cookies + Earnings from cupcakes = $80 + $240 = $320.\n\nSuzanne gave her two sisters $10 each.\nTotal amount given to her sisters = $10 + $10 = $20.\n\nFinally, let's find out how much money Suzanne has left:\nMoney left = Total earnings - Amount given to sisters = $320 - $20 = $300.\n\nSo, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.",
    "answer": "Suzzane's revenue from the cookies is 80 x $1 = $<<80*1=80>>80.\nHer revenue from the cupcakes is 60 x $4 = $<<60*4=240>>240.\nHer total revenue for the cupcakes and cookies is $240 + $80 = $<<240+80=320>>320.\nShe gave a total of 10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20 to her sisters for helping her,\nSo, Suzzane has $32 - $20 = $300 left.\n#### 300"
