    "question": "Lori wants to buy a $320.00 pair of shoes and a matching belt that is $32.00.  Her part-time job pays her $8.00 an hour.  How many hours will she have to work before she can make her purchase?",
    "completion": "To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the $320.00 pair of shoes and the matching $32.00 belt, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt.\n2. Determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn that total amount.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt:\n\\[\n320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00, given that she earns $8.00 per hour. We do this by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage:\n\\[\n\\frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Lori will have to work \\boxed{44} hours before she can make her purchase.",
    "answer": "She wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320.00 and a belt for $32.00 for a total of 320+32 = $<<320+32=352.00>>352.00\nHer purchase will total $352.00 and she makes $8.00 at her part-time job so she'll have to work 352/8 = <<352/8=44>>44 hours\n#### 44"
