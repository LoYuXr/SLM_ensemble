    "question": "Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store.  He bought 2 bag of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 and a bottle of soda for $1.00.  How much did the apple pie cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost of the apple pie, we need to calculate the total amount Gus spent and then subtract the cost of the bag of chips, the bucket of fried chicken, and the bottle of soda.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the bag of chips:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of chips} = 2 \\times \\$2.00 = \\$4.00 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the bucket of fried chicken:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of fried chicken} = \\$8.00 \\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the cost of the bottle of soda:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of soda} = \\$1.00 \\]\n\nNow, we sum up the costs of the bag of chips, the bucket of fried chicken, and the bottle of soda:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost of chips, fried chicken, and soda} = \\$4.00 + \\$8.00 + \\$1.00 = \\$13.00 \\]\n\nGus spent a total of $20.00, so the cost of the apple pie is the total amount spent minus the total cost of the other items:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of apple pie} = \\$20.00 - \\$13.00 = \\$7.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the apple pie is \\(\\boxed{7.00}\\).",
    "answer": "He bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each so they cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00\nHe spent $4.00 on chips, $8.00 on fried chicken and $1.00 on soda so he spent 4+8+1 = $<<4+8+1=13.00>>13.00\nHe spent $20.00 and all of the groceries, except for the pie cost $13.00 so that means the apple pie cost 20-13 = $<<20-13=7.00>>7.00\n#### 7"
