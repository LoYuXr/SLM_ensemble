    "question": "Faraday owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $2 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $8. If Faraday earned $26 from the sunflower and $56 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Faraday able to sell after 3 days?",
    "completion": "To determine how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day:**\n   - Faraday earns $26 from selling sunflowers per day.\n   - Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8.\n   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.\n   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{26}{8} = 3.25\n     \\]\n   - Since Faraday can't sell a fraction of a sunflower, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 3 sunflowers per day.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days:**\n   - Faraday sells 3 sunflowers per day.\n   - Over 3 days, the total number of sunflowers sold is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 3 = 9\n     \\]\n\nThus, Faraday was able to sell \\(\\boxed{9}\\) sunflowers after 3 days.",
    "answer": "Faraday sold $56 / $8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets of sunflower.\nSo he was able to sell a total of 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 sunflowers from the bouquets.\nAnd he was able to sell a total of $26/$2= <<26/2=13>>13 Sunflowers.\nThe sum of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell is 84 + 13 = <<84+13=97>>97.\nTherefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 3 days is 97 x 3 = <<97*3=291>>291.\n#### 291"
