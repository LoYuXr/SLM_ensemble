    "question": "While Joanne is gathering apples from her family\u2019s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of apples Joanne gathered from the shortest trees. Since she gathered half the amount from the shortest trees, she gathered:\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees. She gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, and since she gathered more apples from the average trees, she gathered:\n\\[\nx + 15 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees:\n\\[\nx\n\\]\n\nThe total number of apples Joanne gathered from all the trees is the sum of the apples from the tallest trees, the average trees, and the shortest trees:\n\\[\n30 + (x + 15) + 15 = 500\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\\[\n30 + x + 15 + 15 = 500\n\\]\n\\[\n50 + x = 500\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 450\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Joanne gathered \\(\\boxed{450}\\) apples from the average trees.",
    "answer": "Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.\nHer sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.\nHer sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.\nIn total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.\nFrom the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.\nSo far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.\nTherefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples \u2013 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.\n#### 350"
