    "question": "John is a carpenter. For his friend Ali, he manufactured 4 wooden tables for $20 each and 2 roof frames for $10 each. How much does Ali have to pay John?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:\n- John manufactured 4 wooden tables.\n- Each wooden table costs $20.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the wooden tables is:\n  \\[\n  4 \\text{ tables} \\times \\$20 \\text{ per table} = \\$80\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:\n- John manufactured 2 roof frames.\n- Each roof frame costs $10.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the roof frames is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ frames} \\times \\$10 \\text{ per frame} = \\$20\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the costs of the wooden tables and the roof frames to find the total amount John has to pay Ali:\n\\[\n\\$80 + \\$20 = \\$100\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount Ali has to pay John is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
    "answer": "For the wooden table, Ali should pay: $20 * 4 = $<<20*4=80>>80\nFor the roof frames, Ali should pay: $10 * 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20\nCombining the wooden table and the roof frames, Ali should pay: $20 + $80 = $<<20+80=100>>100\n#### 100"
