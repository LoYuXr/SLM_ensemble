    "question": "Jessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much does she pay in a year?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total minimum payments for all her debts and then apply the 50% increase to each minimum payment.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total minimum payments for each debt:\n- Student loans: $300/month * 12 months = $3600\n- Credit card: $200/month * 12 months = $2400\n- Mortgage: $500/month * 12 months = $6000\n\nNext, we add these amounts together to find the total minimum payments for all debts:\n$3600 + $2400 + $6000 = $11000\n\nNow, we need to calculate 50% more than the total minimum payments:\n50% of $11000 = 0.50 * $11000 = $5500\n\nFinally, we add this 50% increase to the total minimum payments to find the total amount Jessica pays in a year:\n$11000 + $5500 = $16500\n\nTherefore, Jessica pays a total of $16500 in a year.",
    "answer": "First find the total minimum payment each month: $300/month + $200/month + $500/month = $<<300+200+500=1000>>1000/month\nThen multiply that number by 50% to find how much extra Jessica pays each month: $1000/month * .5 = $<<1000*.5=500>>500/month\nAdd that number to the total minimum payment to find how much Jessica pays per month: $1000/month + $500/month = $<<1000+500=1500>>1500/month\nNow multiply that number by the number of months in a year to find Jessica's annual payment: $1500/month * 12 months/year = $<<1500*12=18000>>18,000/year\n#### 18000"
