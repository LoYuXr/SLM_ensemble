    "question": "Anne purchased a box of sweets that contains 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. She kept two packs and gave the rest to her 10 friends equally. How many pieces of sweets did each of her friends receive?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of sweets in the box.\n2. Determine how many sweets Anne kept for herself.\n3. Calculate the number of sweets each of her 10 friends received.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of sweets in the box. Since there are 15 packs and each pack contains 60 pieces, the total number of sweets is:\n\\[ 15 \\times 60 = 900 \\text{ pieces} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many sweets Anne kept for herself. Since she kept 2 packs, the number of sweets she kept is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ pieces} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of sweets each of her 10 friends received. We do this by dividing the total number of sweets by the number of friends:\n\\[ \\frac{900}{10} = 90 \\text{ pieces} \\]\n\nTherefore, each of Anne's friends received \\(\\boxed{90}\\) pieces of sweets.",
    "answer": "After Anne kept 2 packs, there were only 15 - 2 = <<15-2=13>>13 packs left.\nTherefore, there were 13 x 60 = <<13*60=780>>780 pieces of sweets left.\nSo, each of her 10 friends received 780 / 10 = <<780/10=78>>78 pieces of sweets.\n#### 78"
