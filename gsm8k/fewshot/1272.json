    "question": "Helen went on a trip through Germany. She booked a hotel for 3 nights and rode the bus 7 times during that trip. One night at the hotel was a cost of $80, and every bus trip was 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. How much did Helen pay for the hotel and bus travels during that trip?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip to Germany, we need to break down the costs step by step.\n\n1. **Cost of the hotel stay:**\n   Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of hotel} = 3 \\text{ nights} \\times \\text{Cost per night} = 3 \\times 80 = 240 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cost of the bus trips:**\n   Helen rode the bus 7 times.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per bus trip} = 10\\% \\text{ of the cost of one night at the hotel} = 0.10 \\times 80 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total cost for the bus trips is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of bus trips} = 7 \\times 8 = 56 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total cost:**\n   To find the total cost, we add the cost of the hotel stay and the total cost of the bus trips:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of hotel} + \\text{Total cost of bus trips} = 240 + 56 = 296 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip is \\(\\boxed{296}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Helen has spent 3 nights at the hotel, so she needed to pay 3 * 80 = $<<3*80=240>>240 for them.\nOne bus trip was the cost of 80 * 10/100 = $<<80*10/100=8>>8.\nHelen rode the bus 7 times, so she paid 7 * 8 = $<<7*8=56>>56 for that.\nIn total, Helen paid 240 + 56 = $<<240+56=296>>296 in total.\n#### 296"
