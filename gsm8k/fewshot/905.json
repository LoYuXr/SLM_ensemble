    "question": "Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.  He works 2 hours less than he sleeps and he walks his dog for an hour each day.  How much free time does Harold have left in his day?",
    "completion": "To determine how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total amount of time he spends on his activities and then subtract that from the total number of hours in a day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total hours Harold sleeps in a day:\n- Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.\n- There are 7 days in a week.\n- Therefore, the total hours he sleeps in a week is:\n  \\[\n  10 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 7 \\text{ nights/day} = 70 \\text{ hours/day}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total hours Harold works in a day:\n- Harold works 2 hours less than he sleeps.\n- Therefore, the hours he works in a day are:\n  \\[\n  10 \\text{ hours/night} - 2 \\text{ hours} = 8 \\text{ hours/day}\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total hours Harold walks his dog in a day:\n- Harold walks his dog for 1 hour each day.\n- Therefore, the hours he walks his dog in a day are:\n  \\[\n  1 \\text{ hour/day}\n  \\]\n\nTo find the total hours Harold spends on all activities in a day, we add the hours he sleeps, works, and walks his dog:\n\\[\n70 \\text{ hours/day} + 8 \\text{ hours/day} + 1 \\text{ hour/day} = 79 \\text{ hours/day}\n\\]\n\nFinally, to find the free time Harold has left in his day, we subtract the total hours he spends on activities from the total number of hours in a day:\n\\[\n79 \\text{ hours/day} - 70 \\text{ hours/day} = 9 \\text{ hours/day}\n\\]\n\nThus, the free time Harold has left in his day is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9 \\text{ hours/day}}\n\\]",
    "answer": "He works 2 hours less than he sleeps and he sleeps for 10 hours so he works 10-2 = <<10-2=8>>8 hours\nHe sleeps for 10 hours, works for 8 hours and walks his dog for 1 hour for a total of 10+8+1 = <<10+8+1=19>>19 hours\nThere are 24 hours in a day and his busy for 19 hours so that leaves 24-19 = <<24-19=5>>5 hours left of free time\n#### 5"
