    "question": "Janet buys a brooch for her daughter.  She pays $500 for the material to make it and then another $800 for the jeweler to construct it.  After that, she pays 10% of that to get it insured.  How much did she pay?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the material to make the brooch.\n2. Add the cost of the jeweler to construct the brooch.\n3. Calculate the cost of the insurance for the brooch.\n4. Sum up all the costs to get the total amount paid.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The cost of the material to make the brooch is $500.\n2. The cost of the jeweler to construct the brooch is $800.\n3. The cost of the insurance for the brooch is 10% of the total cost of the material and the jeweler. First, we calculate the total cost of the material and the jeweler:\n   \\[\n   500 + 800 = 1300\n   \\]\n4. Next, we calculate 10% of $1300:\n   \\[\n   0.10 \\times 1300 = 130\n   \\]\n5. Finally, we add the cost of the material and the jeweler to the cost of the insurance to get the total amount paid:\n   \\[\n   1300 + 130 = 1430\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Janet paid is \\(\\boxed{1430}\\).",
    "answer": "The total cost of the broch was 500+800=$<<500+800=1300>>1300\nThe insurance was 1300*.1=$<<1300*.1=130>>130\nSo she pays 1300+130=$<<1300+130=1430>>1430\n#### 1430"
