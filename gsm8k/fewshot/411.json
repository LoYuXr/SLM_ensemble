    "question": "Tim decides to light off some fireworks for the fourth of July.  He buys a package of fireworks worth $400 and another pack worth twice that much.  He gets a 20% discount on them.  He also buys a finale firework that costs $150.  How much did he spend in total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount Tim spent on fireworks, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fireworks and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Cost of the first package of fireworks:**\n   The package costs $400.\n\n2. **Cost of the second package of fireworks:**\n   The second package costs twice as much as the first one. Therefore, the cost is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 400 = 800 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Discount on the first package of fireworks:**\n   Tim gets a 20% discount on the first package. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $400:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 400 = 80 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the discounted price of the first package is:\n   \\[\n   400 - 80 = 320 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Cost of the finale firework:**\n   The finale firework costs $150.\n\n5. **Total amount spent:**\n   Now, we sum the costs of all the fireworks:\n   \\[\n   320 + 400 + 150 = 870 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Tim spent is \\(\\boxed{870}\\).",
    "answer": "The second package was worth 400*2=$<<400*2=800>>800\nSo the two packages were worth 400+800=$<<400+800=1200>>1200\nThat means he got a discount of 1200*.2=$<<1200*.2=240>>240\nSo the packages cost 1200-240=$<<1200-240=960>>960\nSo he spent a total of 960+150=$<<960+150=1110>>1110\n#### 1110"
