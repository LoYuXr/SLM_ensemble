    "question": "Uriah's book bag is getting too heavy for him. He needs to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove?",
    "completion": "To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of the comic books.\n2. Determine the total weight of the toys.\n3. Subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight to find the weight of the toys.\n4. Divide the weight of the toys by the weight of each toy to find out how many toys are needed.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The weight of each comic book is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) pound. If Uriah removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. The weight of each toy is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) pound. If Uriah removes all the comic books, the total weight of the toys is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 15 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. The weight of the toys is 15 pounds. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the weight of the toys by the weight of each toy:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{15}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 15 \\times 2 = 30\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Uriah needs to remove \\(\\boxed{30}\\) toys.",
    "answer": "30 comic books weigh 7.5 pounds because 30 x .25 = <<30*.25=7.5>>7.5\nHe needs to remove 7.5 more pounds because 15 - 7.5 = <<15-7.5=7.5>>7.5\nHe needs to remove 15 toys because 7.5 / .5 = <<15=15>>15\n#### 15"
