    "question": "Martin's weight is 55 kg. Carl\u2019s weight is 16 kg more than Martin\u2019s weight. Christian\u2019s weight is 8 kg more than Carl\u2019s weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian\u2019s weight. What is the weight of Harry, in kg?",
    "completion": "To determine the weight of Harry, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Martin's weight:**\n   Martin's weight is given as 55 kg.\n\n2. **Carl's weight:**\n   Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Carl's weight} = 55 \\, \\text{kg} + 16 \\, \\text{kg} = 71 \\, \\text{kg}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Christian's weight:**\n   Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Christian's weight} = 71 \\, \\text{kg} + 8 \\, \\text{kg} = 79 \\, \\text{kg}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Harry's weight:**\n   Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Harry's weight} = 79 \\, \\text{kg} - 5 \\, \\text{kg} = 74 \\, \\text{kg}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the weight of Harry is \\(\\boxed{74}\\) kg.",
    "answer": "Carl\u2019s weight is 55 + 16 = <<55+16=71>>71 kg.\nChristian\u2019s weight is 71 + 8 = <<71+8=79>>79 kg.\nSo, Harry\u2019s weight is 79 - 5 = <<79-5=74>>74 kg.\n#### 74"
