    "question": "Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?",
    "completion": "To determine how many ounces of oil Tanya uses, we need to establish the relationships between the amounts of each ingredient used in the salt scrub. Let's denote the amount of each ingredient used as follows:\n\n- \\( S \\) for salt\n- \\( O \\) for oil\n- \\( F \\) for fragrance\n- \\( C \\) for citrus zest\n- \\( G \\) for sugar\n\nFrom the problem, we know the following relationships:\n\n1. \\( S = F \\)\n2. \\( O = 2G \\)\n3. \\( C = 2S \\)\n4. The total amount of salt used is 10 ounces, so \\( S + O + F + C = 10 \\).\n\nSince \\( S = F \\), we can substitute \\( F \\) for \\( S \\) in the equation for \\( C \\):\n\n\\[ C = 2S \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( C = 2S \\) into the total salt equation:\n\n\\[ S + O + F + 2S = 10 \\]\n\\[ 3S + O + F = 10 \\]\n\nNext, substitute \\( O = 2G \\) and \\( F = S \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ 3S + 2G + S = 10 \\]\n\\[ 4S + 2G = 10 \\]\n\\[ 2S + G = 5 \\]\n\nWe need to find the values of \\( S \\), \\( O \\), \\( F \\), and \\( G \\) that satisfy this equation. Since \\( S \\), \\( O \\), \\( F \\), and \\( G \\) are all positive and must be integers, we can test possible values for \\( S \\):\n\nIf \\( S = 1 \\):\n\\[ 2(1) + G = 5 \\]\n\\[ 2 + G = 5 \\]\n\\[ G = 3 \\]\n\nSo, \\( S = 1 \\), \\( O = 2G = 2(3) = 6 \\), \\( F = S = 1 \\), and \\( G = 3 \\). Let's verify the total amount of salt:\n\n\\[ S + O + F + C = 1 + 6 + 1 + 2(3) = 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 = 14 \\]\n\nSince the total amount of salt is 10 ounces, we need to adjust the values of \\( S \\",
    "answer": "Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.\nTanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.\nShe uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.\nShe uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.\nShe uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.\nIn all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = <<6+4=10>>10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil.\nThus, she uses Z = 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1 ounce of zest.\nThus, Tanya uses 4Z = <<4=4>>4 ounces of oil.\n#### 4"
