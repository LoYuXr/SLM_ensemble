    "question": "Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar to make a batch of suckers and 70 ounces of sugar to make a batch of fudge. How much sugar does he need to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge?",
    "completion": "To determine how much sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge, we need to calculate the amount of sugar required for each type of batch separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:\n- Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for each batch of suckers.\n- Therefore, for 8 batches, the total amount of sugar needed is:\n  \\[\n  30 \\text{ ounces/batch} \\times 8 \\text{ batches} = 240 \\text{ ounces}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:\n- Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for each batch of fudge.\n- Therefore, for 1 batch, the total amount of sugar needed is:\n  \\[\n  70 \\text{ ounces/batch} \\times 1 \\text{ batch} = 70 \\text{ ounces}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the amounts of sugar needed for both types of batches:\n- The total amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers is 240 ounces.\n- The total amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge is 70 ounces.\n- Therefore, the total amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge is:\n  \\[\n  240 \\text{ ounces} + 70 \\text{ ounces} = 310 \\text{ ounces}\n  \\]\n\nSo, the total amount of sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge is \\boxed{310} ounces.",
    "answer": "First find the total sugar needed for the suckers: 30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = <<30*8=240>>240 ounces\nThen add the amount he needs to make the fudge to find the total amount of sugar needed: 240 ounces + 70 ounces = <<240+70=310>>310 ounces\n#### 310"
