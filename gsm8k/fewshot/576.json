    "question": "Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.\u00a0 The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square\u00a0foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.\u00a0 His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.\u00a0 His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.\u00a0 How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet in his bedroom, we need to break down the costs into two main components: the cost of the new carpet and the cost of the padding underneath.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the new carpet:**\n   - The new carpet costs $12 per square foot.\n   - The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.\n   - Therefore, the area of the bedroom is \\(18 \\times 12 = 216\\) square feet.\n   - The cost of the new carpet is \\(216 \\times 12 = 2592\\) dollars.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the padding:**\n   - The padding costs $2 per square foot.\n   - The area of the bedroom is 216 square feet.\n   - Therefore, the cost of the padding is \\(216 \\times 2 = 432\\) dollars.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the new carpet and the cost of the padding.\n   - Therefore, the total cost is \\(2592 + 432 = 3024\\) dollars.\n\nSo, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is \\(\\boxed{3024}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "The room measures 18 * 12 = <<18*12=216>>216 square feet.\nThe new carpet costs $12 * 216 = $<<12*216=2592>>2,592.\nThe new carpet padding costs $2 * 216 = $<<2*216=432>>432.\nTo remove the old carpet, the contractor will charge $4 * 216 = $<<4*216=864>>864.\nTo install the new carpet, the contractor will charge $34 * 216 = $<<34*216=7344>>7,344.\nThe total cost will be $864\u00a0+ $2,592\u00a0+ $432\u00a0+ $7,344 = $11,232.\n#### 11232"
