    "question": "Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the original price of the tattered jeans as \\( T \\) and the original price of the jogger jeans as \\( J \\). According to the problem, the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can write:\n\n\\[ J = T - 6 \\]\n\nThe total cost of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans is $28, so we can write:\n\n\\[ T + J = 28 \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\( J \\) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\n\\[ T + (T - 6) = 28 \\]\n\\[ 2T - 6 = 28 \\]\n\\[ 2T = 34 \\]\n\\[ T = 17 \\]\n\nSo, the original price of the tattered jeans is $17. Now, we can find the original price of the jogger jeans:\n\n\\[ J = T - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11 \\]\n\nCole saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings from the jogger jeans as \\( S_J \\) and the total savings from the tattered jeans as \\( S_T \\). We know that:\n\n\\[ S_J = \\frac{1}{3} S_T \\]\n\\[ S_T = \\frac{2}{3} S_J \\]\n\nThe total savings from both jeans is $6, so we can write:\n\n\\[ S_J + S_T = 6 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} S_T + \\frac{2}{3} S_T = 6 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{3}{3} S_T = 6 \\]\n\\[ S_T = 6 \\]\n\nNow, substituting \\( S_T = 6 \\) into the equation \\( S_T = \\frac{2}{3} S_J \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{2}{3} S_J \\]\n\\[ S_J = 6 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 9 \\]\n\nSo, the original price of the jogger jeans is $9. Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:\n\n\\[ J - T = 11 - 17 = -6 \\]\n\nSince",
    "answer": "Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.\nSo, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.\nThe original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $<<22+2=24>>24.\nCole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28\nHence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.\nTherefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.\n#### 8"
