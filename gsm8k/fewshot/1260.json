    "question": "Jade bought a new cell phone with an incredible camera, so she spent all week taking pictures of her daily life. At the end of the week, she had taken 210 photos. She wants to upload all her photos on her Instagram. If she uploads 7 photos in one batch and she uploads 6 batches each day, how many days will she need to upload all of her photos?",
    "completion": "To determine how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of photos uploaded in one batch:**\n   Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of photos uploaded in one day:**\n   Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch and 6 batches each day. Therefore, the total number of photos uploaded in one day is:\n   \\[\n   7 \\text{ photos/batch} \\times 6 \\text{ batches/day} = 42 \\text{ photos/day}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total number of photos uploaded in the week:**\n   Jade has 210 photos in total. To find out how many days she needs to upload all her photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{210 \\text{ photos}}{42 \\text{ photos/day}} = 5 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Jade will need \\(\\boxed{5}\\) days to upload all of her photos.",
    "answer": "Jade needs a total of 210 photos / 7 photos/batch = <<210/7=30>>30 batches to upload all her photos.\nEach day she uploads 6 batches, so she will need 30 \u00f7 6 = <<30/6=5>>5 days in total to upload all the photos.\n#### 5"
