    "question": "Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?",
    "completion": "To determine the temperature of the second mug of water, we need to analyze the information given and use the principle of conservation of water.\n\n1. **Initial Conditions:**\n   - Donny has two mugs of water.\n   - One mug is 33 degrees.\n   - The other mug is an unknown temperature, let's call it \\( T \\) degrees.\n\n2. **Water Pouring:**\n   - Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle.\n   - He then pours 1 ounce of water from the unknown mug into his water bottle.\n\n3. **Final Condition:**\n   - After these actions, Donny is able to drink the water from both mugs.\n\n4. **Water Conservation:**\n   - The total amount of water in the 33-degree mug after pouring is \\( 33 - 4 = 29 \\) ounces.\n   - The total amount of water in the unknown mug after pouring is \\( T - 1 \\) ounces.\n\n5. **Total Water in the Mugs:**\n   - The total amount of water in both mugs combined is \\( 29 + (T - 1) = 28 + T \\) ounces.\n\n6. **Water Consumption:**\n   - Donny is able to drink the water from both mugs, so the total amount of water he consumes is equal to the total amount of water in the mugs.\n   - Therefore, \\( 28 + T = 29 + 4 \\).\n\n7. **Solving for \\( T \\):**\n   \\[\n   28 + T = 33\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   T = 33 - 28\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   T = 5\n   \\]\n\nThus, the temperature of the second mug of water is \\(\\boxed{5}\\) degrees.",
    "answer": "There are 5 total ounces of water because 4 + 1 = <<4+1=5>>5\nThe total temperatures is >=200 because 200 / 5 =<<200/5=40>>40\nThe 33 degree water contributes 132 points towards this because 4 x 33 = <<4*33=132>>132\nThe unknown temperature is at least 68 because 200 - 132 = <<200-132=68>>68\n#### 68"
