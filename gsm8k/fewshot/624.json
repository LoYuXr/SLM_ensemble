    "question": "Two sports coaches went shopping together. The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each. The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each. How much more did the basketball coach spend than the baseball coach?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount each coach spent and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount the baseball coach spent:\n- The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs.\n- Each baseball costs $3.\n- Therefore, the total amount spent by the baseball coach is:\n  \\[\n  9 \\text{ baseballs} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars per baseball} = 27 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount the basketball coach spent:\n- The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs.\n- Each basketball costs $14.\n- Therefore, the total amount spent by the basketball coach is:\n  \\[\n  8 \\text{ basketballs} \\times 14 \\text{ dollars per basketball} = 112 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the amount spent by the basketball coach and the amount spent by the baseball coach:\n\\[\n112 \\text{ dollars} - 27 \\text{ dollars} = 85 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the basketball coach spent \\(\\boxed{85}\\) dollars more than the baseball coach.",
    "answer": "The cost of the baseballs is 9 \u00d7 $3 = $<<9*3=27>>27.\nThe cost of the basketballs is 8 \u00d7 $14 = $<<8*14=112>>112.\nBasketballs cost $112 \u2212 $27 = $85 more.\n#### 85"
