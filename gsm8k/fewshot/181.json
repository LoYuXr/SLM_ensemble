    "question": "Sandra, the florist around the corner, is very unhappy with Fred's incomplete order delivery. Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?",
    "completion": "To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( W \\) represent the number of white carnations Fred ordered.\n   - Fred ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses ordered is \\( 4W \\).\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Pink Calla Lilies:**\n   - Fred ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.\n   - Therefore, the number of white carnations ordered is \\( \\frac{200}{5} = 40 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Red Roses:**\n   - Fred ordered \\( 4W \\) red roses.\n   - Since \\( W = 40 \\), the number of red roses is \\( 4 \\times 40 = 160 \\).\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Red Roses Fred Must Deliver:**\n   - Fred needs to deliver the same number of red roses as he ordered, which is 160 red roses.\n\nThus, Fred must deliver \\(\\boxed{160}\\) red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.",
    "answer": "Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies / 5 = <<200/5=40>>40 white carnations.\nSandra therefore ordered 4 * 40 = <<4*40=160>>160 red roses.\n#### 160"
