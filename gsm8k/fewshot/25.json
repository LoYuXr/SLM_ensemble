    "question": "Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $8.50?",
    "completion": "To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples, and then use that information to find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the chicken meal:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of chicken meal} = \\$12 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the milk packs:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of milk packs} = 5 \\times \\$3 = \\$15 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the apples:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of apples} = 4 \\times \\$1.50 = \\$6 \\]\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of boxes of pizza. The cost of the boxes of pizza is:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of boxes of pizza} = x \\times \\$8.50 \\]\n\nThe total cost of all the items is given as $50. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ \\$12 + \\$15 + \\$6 + x \\times \\$8.50 = \\$50 \\]\n\nSimplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[ \\$33 + x \\times \\$8.50 = \\$50 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), subtract \\$33 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x \\times \\$8.50 = \\$50 - \\$33 \\]\n\\[ x \\times \\$8.50 = \\$17 \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by \\$8.50:\n\\[ x = \\frac{\\$17}{\\$8.50} \\]\n\\[ x = 2 \\]\n\nSo, Marie ordered \\(\\boxed{2}\\) boxes of pizza.",
    "answer": "Five packs of milk cost $3 x 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.\nFour apples cost $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.5*4=6>>6.\nThe total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $<<12+15+6=33>>33.\nThus, the boxes of pizza cost $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.\nTherefore, Marie ordered $17/$8.50 = <<17/8.5=2>>2 boxes of pizza.\n#### 2"
