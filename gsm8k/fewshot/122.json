    "question": "Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less, each, because she had to complete some assignments. If the rest of the week she slept 1 hour more than those two days, how many hours did she sleep in total throughout the week?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.\n2. **Tuesday**: Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \\(8 - 2 = 6\\) hours.\n3. **Wednesday**: Sadie slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept \\(6 - 2 = 4\\) hours.\n4. **Thursday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than Wednesday, so she slept \\(4 + 1 = 5\\) hours.\n5. **Friday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept \\(5 + 1 = 6\\) hours.\n\nNow, we sum the hours she slept each day:\n\\[8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 29\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week is \\(\\boxed{29}\\).",
    "answer": "If on Monday she slept 8 hours, then she slept 8-2 = <<8-2=6>>6 hours on each of the next two days.\nThe total number of hours slept for the two days will be 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours.\nIf she slept 1 hour more for the rest of the week each day, then each day she slept 6+1 = <<6+1=7>>7 hours.\nThe total for the rest of the week will be 4*7 = <<4*7=28>>28 hours.\nThe total number of hours slept for the whole week will be 8+12+28 = <<8+12+28=48>>48 hours.\n#### 48"
