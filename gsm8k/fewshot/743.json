    "question": "Mara added 3 slices of cake to a plate that already had 2 slices on it. She was getting hungrier so she tripled the number of slices she currently has. She ate 2 slices and while she was distracted, her friend stole 5 slices off her plate. What number of cake slices remained on the plate?",
    "completion": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Initially, the plate had 2 slices of cake.\n2. Mara added 3 more slices to the plate.\n   - So, the plate now has \\(2 + 3 = 5\\) slices.\n3. Mara ate 2 slices.\n   - So, the plate now has \\(5 - 2 = 3\\) slices.\n4. Mara's friend stole 5 slices.\n   - So, the plate now has \\(3 - 5 = -2\\) slices.\n\nSince it's not possible to have a negative number of slices on a plate, it means Mara's friend stole more slices than she could have eaten. Therefore, the number of cake slices remaining on the plate is \\(-2\\).",
    "answer": "Mara had 3+2=<<3+2=5>>5 slices of cake.\nShe was hungry and tripled the amount to 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 slices.\nShe ate a couple, leaving 15-2=<<15-2=13>>13 slices.\nHer friend came and stole some which left Mara to 13-5=<<13-5=8>>8 slices.\n#### 8"
