    "question": "Twenty students are working together to raise money for a charity. Each earns the same amount. The charity raises a total of $175,000. $50,000 comes from organizations and the rest from the students. How much did each student raise?",
    "completion": "To determine how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount raised by the students.\n2. Divide the total amount raised by the number of students.\n\nFirst, we know that the charity raises a total of $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:\n\\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much each student raised. We do this by dividing the total amount raised by the number of students:\n\\[ \\frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \\]\n\nSo, each student raised \\(\\boxed{6250}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Amount raised by all students was 175,000-50,000 = <<175000-50000=125000>>125,000 dollars.\nAmount raised by each student was 125,000/20 = <<125000/20=6250>>6,250 dollars.\n#### 6,250"
