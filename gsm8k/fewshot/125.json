    "question": "Julia was preparing for a dinner party at her house, where she intended to serve stew.  She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons.  Later, her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.  While Julia was making the stew, she used three of the spoons to sample her stew.  Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.  How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?",
    "completion": "To determine how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of spoons Julia had after using some:**\n   Julia had 12 spoons after setting the table.\n\n2. **Determine how many spoons she used:**\n   Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of spoons left after using some:**\n   Subtract the number of spoons used from the total number of spoons:\n   \\[\n   12 - 3 = 9\n   \\]\n   So, Julia had 9 spoons left after using some.\n\n4. **Determine the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought:**\n   Julia bought a new package of 5 spoons. Since she had 9 spoons left after using some, the number of spoons in the package must be:\n   \\[\n   9 + 5 = 14\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
    "answer": "The total number of spoons from Julia and her husband was 12+3=<<12+3=15>>15 spoons.\nSince the husband bought a package of five spoons, then Julia's package contained 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 spoons.\n#### 10"
