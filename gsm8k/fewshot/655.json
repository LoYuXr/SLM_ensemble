    "question": "Shiela is required to submit a 15-page research paper. She already finished writing 1/3 of the paper. How many pages does she have left to write?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pages Shiela has left to write, we start by calculating the number of pages she has already written. Shiela has already finished writing \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the 15-page research paper. We can find this by multiplying 15 by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n15 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, Shiela has written 5 pages. To find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages in the paper:\n\n\\[\n15 - 5 = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Shiela has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) pages left to write.",
    "answer": "Shiela has already written one third of the paper which is 15 pages x 1/3 = <<15*1/3=5>>5 pages.\nSo, she still needs to write 15 pages - 5 pages = <<15-5=10>>10 pages.\n#### 10"
