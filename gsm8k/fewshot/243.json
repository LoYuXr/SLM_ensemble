    "question": "Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. Every day he has a 15-minute call with his boss, and he's had 300 extra minutes of call this month to other people. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?",
    "completion": "To determine how many minutes Jason has left in his phone plan for the month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used this month.\n2. Subtract the total number of minutes used from the original plan.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used this month. Jason has a 1000-minute plan per month, and he has a 15-minute call with his boss every day. Additionally, he has 300 extra minutes of call to other people. So, the total number of minutes used is:\n\\[ 1000 \\text{ minutes} + 15 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} + 300 \\text{ minutes} = 1000 + 450 + 300 = 1750 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total number of minutes used from the original plan:\n\\[ 1000 \\text{ minutes} - 1750 \\text{ minutes} = -750 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSince it's not possible to have a negative number of minutes, it means Jason has already exceeded the plan by 750 minutes. Therefore, the number of minutes Jason has left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]",
    "answer": "First find the total time Jason spends calling his boss: 15 minutes/call * 30 calls/month = <<15*30=450>>450 minutes\nThen subtract the minutes Jason has already used to find how many he has left: 1000 minutes - 450 minutes - 300 minutes = <<1000-450-300=250>>250 minutes\n#### 250"
