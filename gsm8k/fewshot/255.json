    "question": "Ten stalls have 20 cows each. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally, putting an equal number of the new cows into each of the twenty stalls. How many cows are in 8 of the stalls?",
    "completion": "To determine how many cows are in 8 of the stalls after Mr. Sylas divides the new cows equally, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cows Mr. Sylas initially has:**\n   Each of the 10 stalls initially has 20 cows, so the total number of cows is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 20 = 200\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many cows are in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows:**\n   After buying 40 cows, the total number of cows becomes:\n   \\[\n   200 + 40 = 240\n   \\]\n   Since the cows are divided equally into 20 stalls, the number of cows in each stall is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{240}{20} = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate how many cows are in 8 of the stalls:**\n   If each of the 20 stalls originally had 12 cows, then the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 12 = 96\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
    "answer": "When Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the cows he bought into the stalls, each stall gets 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 new cows.\nEach of the stalls gets four cows, meaning a total of 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 cows are placed into eight of the stalls.\nSince each stall had 20 cows before Mr. Sylas added four into each of the stalls, the total number of cows in eight of the stalls was 8*20= <<8*20=160>>160 cows.\nThere are 160+32 = <<160+32=192>>192 cows in eight stalls after Mr. Sylas adds four into each of the stalls.\n#### 192"
