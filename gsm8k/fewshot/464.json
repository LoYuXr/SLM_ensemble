    "question": "Finley took part in a 100-meter race.  She started off in first, but then fell back 5 spots.  She then moved ahead 2 spots, before falling behind 3.  Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot to finish the race.  What place did she finish in?",
    "completion": "To determine Finley's final place in the 100-meter race, we need to track her progress step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Finley starts in first place.\n2. **First Drop**: She falls back 5 spots.\n   - New position: \\(1 - 5 = -4\\)\n   - Since a negative position doesn't make sense in this context, we interpret this as Finley finishing 4 places behind.\n3. **Second Move**: She moves ahead 2 spots.\n   - New position: \\(-4 + 2 = -2\\)\n   - Again, interpreting this as Finley finishing 2 places behind.\n4. **Third Drop**: She falls back 3 spots.\n   - New position: \\(-2 - 3 = -5\\)\n   - Again, interpreting this as Finley finishing 5 places behind.\n5. **Fourth Jump**: She jumps ahead 1 spot.\n   - New position: \\(-5 + 1 = -4\\)\n   - Again, interpreting this as Finley finishing 4 places behind.\n\nSince Finley is now 4 places behind, she will finish in the 4th place.",
    "answer": "Finley started off at 1st place but then lost 5 spots, which translates to 1+5= <<1+5=6>>6th place\nShe then moved ahead two spots, which is expressed as 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4th place\nShe then fell behind by 3 spots, which is expressed as 4+3=<<4+3=7>>7th place\nShe finished the race moving ahead 1 spot, which is expressed as 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6th place\n#### 6"
