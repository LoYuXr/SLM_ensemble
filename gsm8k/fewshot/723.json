    "question": "The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 chairs for babies. If 20 of the normal chairs and 13 of the baby chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair, how many chairs does the restaurant have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how many chairs the restaurant has left after sending some to the carpenter, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of normal chairs initially.\n2. Calculate the total number of baby chairs initially.\n3. Subtract the number of chairs sent to the carpenter from the initial number of chairs.\n4. Subtract the number of chairs sent to the carpenter from the total number of chairs after the initial distribution.\n\nLet's start with the initial number of chairs:\n\n- The restaurant has 170 normal chairs.\n- The restaurant has 23 chairs for babies.\n\nSo, the total number of chairs initially is:\n\\[ 170 + 23 = 193 \\]\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent to the carpenter:\n\n- 20 normal chairs were sent to the carpenter.\n- 13 baby chairs were sent to the carpenter.\n\nSo, the total number of chairs sent to the carpenter is:\n\\[ 20 + 13 = 33 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of chairs sent to the carpenter from the total number of chairs after the initial distribution:\n\n\\[ 193 - 33 = 160 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of chairs left in the restaurant is:\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]",
    "answer": "Before sending the chairs and baby chairs to the carpenter the restaurant had 170 + 23 = <<170+23=193>>193 chairs.\nThey sent 20 + 13 = <<20+13=33>>33 chairs to the carpenter.\nNow, they have 193 - 33 = <<193-33=160>>160 chairs left.\n#### 160"
