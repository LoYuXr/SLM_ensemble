    "question": "Courtney attended a concert and reported that the audience was 48 in number. However, Kelly went to the same concert and said that Courtney had made the mistake of overstating the number of people in attendance by 20%. If Kelly was right, how many people really attended the concert?",
    "completion": "To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to account for the mistake made by Kelly. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the number of people in the original report:**\n   - The original report stated that the audience was 48 people.\n\n2. **Determine the mistake made by Kelly:**\n   - Kelly said that Courtney had made the mistake of overstating the number of people in attendance by 20%.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of people in the original report that should have been reported:**\n   - If the mistake was 20%, then the number of people in the original report should have been:\n     \\[\n     48 \\times (1 + 0.20) = 48 \\times 1.20 = 57.6\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the actual number of people who attended the concert:**\n   - Since the mistake was 20%, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:\n     \\[\n     57.6 \\times (1 - 0.20) = 57.6 \\times 0.80 = 46.88\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \\(\\boxed{46.88}\\).",
    "answer": "Since she overstated the number by 20%, 48 is 20% greater than the actual number i.e. 48 = 100% + 20% = 120% of the actual number = 120/100 of the actual number\nTherefore, the actual number = (100/120)*48 = <<(100/120)*48=40>>40\n#### 40"
