    "question": "The highest temperature ever recorded in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit. The highest temperature ever recorded in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit. The highest temperature recorded in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit. What is the average highest temperature of these 3 countries?",
    "completion": "To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the highest temperature for each country.\n2. Sum these temperatures.\n3. Divide the sum by the number of countries.\n\nThe highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThe highest temperature in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThe highest temperature in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nFirst, we sum these temperatures:\n\\[\n-48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -20\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:\n\\[\n\\frac{-20}{3} = -\\frac{20}{3} \\approx -6.67\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average highest temperature of these three countries is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\frac{20}{3}}\n\\]",
    "answer": "-48 + 21 + (-3) = <<-48+21+(-3)=-30>>-30\n-30/3 = <<-30/3=-10>>-10 degrees\nThe average highest temperature recorded in Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.\n#### -10"
