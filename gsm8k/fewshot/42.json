    "question": "Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the fireman's luncheon.  She cut each pie into 8 pieces and set the five pies out on the buffet table for the guests to serve themselves.  At the end of the evening, after the guests had taken and eaten their pieces of pie, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining.  How many pieces were taken by the guests?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pie pieces baked by Grandma Jones.\n2. Determine how many pieces were taken by the guests.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of pie pieces baked. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ pies} \\times 8 \\text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \\text{ pieces} \\]\n\nNext, we know that after the guests took their pieces of pie, there were 14 pieces remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of pieces remaining from the total number of pieces baked:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ pieces} - 14 \\text{ pieces} = 26 \\text{ pieces} \\]\n\nThus, the number of pieces taken by the guests is \\(\\boxed{26}\\).",
    "answer": "To start the evening, there were 5 pies, each with 8 pieces, which is 5*8=<<5*8=40>>40 pieces of pie.\nIf only 14 remained, then 40-14=<<40-14=26>>26 pieces of pie had been taken by guests.\n#### 26"
