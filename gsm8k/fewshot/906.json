    "question": "Tim has a box with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. If he uses 3 blue shoeboxes and 1/3 red of his shoeboxes to go fishing, how many red and blue shoe boxes are left in Tim's box?",
    "completion": "To determine how many red and blue shoe boxes are left in Tim's box after he uses some for fishing, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial number of shoe boxes:**\n   - Blue shoe boxes: 7\n   - Red shoe boxes: 9\n\n2. **Number of shoe boxes used for fishing:**\n   - Blue shoe boxes used: 3\n   - Red shoe boxes used: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 9 = 3\\)\n\n3. **Total number of shoe boxes used:**\n   - Blue shoe boxes used: 3\n   - Red shoe boxes used: 3\n   - Total used: \\(3 + 3 = 6\\)\n\n4. **Number of shoe boxes left:**\n   - Blue shoe boxes left: \\(7 - 3 = 4\\)\n   - Red shoe boxes left: \\(9 - 3 = 6\\)\n\n5. **Total number of shoe boxes left:**\n   - Blue shoe boxes left: 4\n   - Red shoe boxes left: 6\n\nTherefore, the number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box is \\(\\boxed{4 \\text{ red and } 6 \\text{ blue}}\\).",
    "answer": "If Tim uses 3 blue shoeboxes, he remains with 7-3=<<7-3=4>>4 blue shoe boxes in the box.\nTim also uses 1/3 of the red shoeboxes, a total of 1/3*9=<<1/3*9=3>>3 red shoe boxes.\nTim remains with 9-3=<<9-3=6>>6 red shoeboxes.\nThe total number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box is 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10\n#### 10"
