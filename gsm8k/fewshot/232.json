    "question": "Dax went to their farm to pick some apples and found half as many bugs as ants in the garden. If there were 50 ants, calculate the total number of insects in the garden.",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of insects in the garden, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of ants.\n2. Determine the number of bugs based on the number of ants.\n3. Calculate the total number of insects by adding the number of ants and the number of bugs.\n\nGiven:\n- The number of ants is 50.\n- The number of bugs is half the number of ants.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of bugs:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of bugs} = \\frac{\\text{Number of ants}}{2} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the total number of insects by adding the number of ants and the number of bugs:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of insects} = \\text{Number of ants} + \\text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of insects in the garden is \\boxed{75}.",
    "answer": "If there were 50 ants, the total number of bugs in the garden is 1 bug/2 ants * 50 ants = 25 bugs\nThe total number of insects in the garden is 25 bugs + 50 ants = <<25+50=75>>75 insects\n#### 75"
