    "question": "Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother.  What is the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now?",
    "completion": "To determine the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**\n   - Emil is currently 19 years old.\n   - When he turns 24, he will be \\(24 - 19 = 5\\) years old.\n\n2. **Set up the relationship between Emil's age and his dad's age:**\n   - According to the problem, when Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.\n   - Let \\(D\\) be the age of Emil's dad.\n   - Let \\(B\\) be the age of Emil's brother.\n   - When Emil is 24, he will be \\(D + 5\\) years old.\n   - Therefore, \\(D + 5 = \\frac{1}{2}B\\).\n\n3. **Set up the relationship between Emil's age and his brother's age:**\n   - The problem states that when Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.\n   - Therefore, \\(D + 5 = 2B\\).\n\n4. **Solve the system of equations:**\n   - From the first equation: \\(D + 5 = \\frac{1}{2}B\\)\n   - From the second equation: \\(D + 5 = 2B\\)\n\n   Subtract the first equation from the second:\n   \\[\n   (D + 5) - (D + 5) = 2B - \\frac{1}{2}B\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   0 = \\frac{3}{2}B\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   B = 0\n   \\]\n   However, this result is not possible because it would mean Emil is not older than his brother. Let's re-evaluate the problem.\n\n   Correctly, we should have:\n   \\[\n   D + 5 = 2B\n   \\]\n   and\n   \\[\n   D + 5 = \\frac{1}{2}B\n   \\]\n\n   Subtract the first equation from the second:\n   \\[\n   (D + 5) - (D + 5) = \\frac{1}{2}B - 2B\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   0 =",
    "answer": "His dad will be 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 years old when Emil is 24.\nHis brother will be 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 years old then.\nEmil will turn 24 in 24 - 19 = <<24-19=5>>5 years.\nThe age of his father now is 48 - 5= <<48-5=43>>43.\nHis brother is 12 - 5 = <<12-5=7>>7 years old right now.\nThe sum of his dad's and his brother's ages now is 43 + 7 = <<43+7=50>>50.\n#### 50"
