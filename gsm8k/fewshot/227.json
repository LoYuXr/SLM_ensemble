    "question": "Chad ordered a build-your-own burrito for lunch.  The base burrito is $6.50.  He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00 and 2 sauces for $0.25 each.  He decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00 which will add chips and a drink.  He has a gift card for $5.00 that he uses at check out.  How much does he still owe?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of the burrito and the additional charges, and then subtract the gift card value from this total.\n\n1. **Base Burrito Cost:**\n   The base burrito costs $6.50.\n\n2. **Additional Charges:**\n   - Extra meat costs $2.00\n   - Extra cheese costs $1.00\n   - Avocado costs $1.00\n   - 2 sauces cost $0.25 each, so $0.25 \u00d7 2 = $0.50\n\n   Adding these costs together:\n   \\[\n   2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 4.50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Cost Before Upgrade:**\n   Adding the base cost and the additional charges:\n   \\[\n   6.50 + 4.50 = 11.00\n   \\]\n\n4. **Additional Charges for Upgrade:**\n   Chad decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00.\n\n5. **Total Cost After Upgrade:**\n   Adding the upgrade cost to the total cost before the upgrade:\n   \\[\n   11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00\n   \\]\n\n6. **Gift Card Value:**\n   Chad has a gift card worth $5.00.\n\n7. **Total Amount Owed:**\n   Subtracting the gift card value from the total cost after the upgrade:\n   \\[\n   14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Chad still owes \\(\\boxed{9.00}\\).",
    "answer": "He orders 2 sauces at $0.25 each so 2*.25 = $<<2*.25=0.50>>0.50 for sauce\nHe orders extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00 and $0.50 for sauce for a total of 2+1+1+.50 = $<<2+1+1+.5=4.50>>4.50 in extras\nHis burrito cost $6.50 and he adds $4.50 in extras and upgrades his meal for $3.00 so now he owes, 6.50+4.50+3 = $<<6.50+4.50+3=14.00>>14.00\nHe has a $5.00 gift card and his current bill is $14.00 so he will owe 14-5 = $<<14-5=9.00>>9.00\n#### 9"
