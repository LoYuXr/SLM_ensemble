    "question": "Carson lives in an old house where the pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees. Every log of wood Carson burns heats the house up by 5 degrees. If it was 45 degrees during the day, and it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, how many logs does Carson need to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing?",
    "completion": "To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the temperature difference between the day and night:**\n   - Day temperature: 45 degrees\n   - Night temperature: 33 degrees\n   - Temperature difference: \\( 45 - 33 = 12 \\) degrees\n\n2. **Determine the rate of heat production per log:**\n   - Each log heats the house up by 5 degrees.\n   - Therefore, the rate of heat production per log is \\( \\frac{5 \\text{ degrees}}{12 \\text{ degrees per log}} = \\frac{5}{12} \\text{ degrees per log} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the total heat required to raise the temperature by 12 degrees:**\n   - Total heat required: \\( 12 \\text{ degrees} \\times \\frac{5}{12} \\text{ degrees per log} = 5 \\text{ logs} \\)\n\n4. **Determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn:**\n   - Since each log provides 5 degrees of heat, Carson needs to burn \\( \\frac{5 \\text{ logs}}{5 \\text{ degrees per log}} = 1 \\text{ log} \\).\n\nTherefore, Carson needs to burn 1 log of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing.",
    "answer": "First find the night-time temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = <<45-33=12>>12 degrees\nThen find how much Carson needs to heat his house to avoid the pipes freezing: 32 degrees - 12 degrees = <<32-12=20>>20 degrees\nThen divide the amount of heat Carson needs by the amount of heat each log produces: 20 degrees / 5 degrees/log = <<20/5=4>>4 logs\n#### 4"
