    "question": "The Llesis family drove and hiked 6 hours to their vacation spot. They drove an average of 50 miles per hour and hiked an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive. If it took them 1.5 hours to hike, how far was their vacation spot?",
    "completion": "To determine the distance of the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the total distance driven and hiked and then use the given information about the hiking time.\n\nFirst, let's find the average speed when driving. The average speed when driving is 50 miles per hour.\n\nNext, we need to find the average speed when hiking. The problem states that hiking an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when driving. Half of their driving speed is:\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\nSo, hiking at an average speed of:\n\\[\n25 - 5 = 20 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that it took them 1.5 hours to hike. The distance they hiked is:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 1.5 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThe total distance driven is the sum of the distance hiked and the distance driven:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ miles} + 6 \\text{ miles} = 36 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the distance of their vacation spot is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.\nHence, their average speed hiking was 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 miles per hour.\nSo, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.\nIt took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.\nSo, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.\nTherefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.\n#### 255"
