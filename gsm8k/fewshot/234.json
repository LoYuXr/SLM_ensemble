    "question": "Steve decides to start eating more tomatoes and decides to grows his own cherry tomatoes.  He eats twice as much as his girlfriend.  He eats 6 per day.  If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week how many vines does he need?",
    "completion": "To determine how many vines Steve needs to grow to produce enough tomatoes to eat twice as much as his girlfriend, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of tomatoes Steve eats per day:**\n   Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes Steve eats per week:**\n   Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of tomatoes Steve eats per day by 7:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ tomatoes/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 42 \\text{ tomatoes/week}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many tomatoes Steve needs to eat per week to eat twice as much as his girlfriend:**\n   If Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we need to find out how many tomatoes his girlfriend eats per week. Let \\( G \\) be the number of tomatoes his girlfriend eats per week. Then:\n   \\[\n   2G = 42 \\text{ tomatoes/week}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( G \\):\n   \\[\n   G = \\frac{42}{2} = 21 \\text{ tomatoes/week}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many tomatoes Steve needs to grow per week:**\n   Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we need to find out how many days it takes for him to grow enough tomatoes to meet his girlfriend's weekly consumption. We divide the number of tomatoes his girlfriend eats per week by the number of tomatoes Steve eats per day:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21 \\text{ tomatoes/week}}{6 \\text{ tomatoes/day}} = 3.5 \\text{ days/week}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of vines needed:**\n   A vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed to produce 3.5 days of tomatoes, we divide the number of days by the number of tomatoes produced per day:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3.5 \\text{ days}}{3 \\text{ tomatoes/day}} = \\frac{3.5}{3} \\approx 1.1667\n   \\]\n   Since Steve can't grow a fraction of a vine, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to grow 2 vines.\n\nThus, the number of vines Steve needs to grow is \\(\\boxed{2",
    "answer": "His girlfriend eats 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 tomatoes per day\nSo together they eat 6+3=<<6+3=9>>9 tomatoes a day\nThat means they eat 9*7=<<9*7=63>>63 tomatoes a day\nSo he needs 63/3=<<63/3=21>>21 tomato vines\n#### 21"
