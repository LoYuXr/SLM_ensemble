    "question": "Fishio posted her selfie on Instagram. She received 2000 likes on the photo after 1 week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. If she received 20000 more new likes recently, how many Instagram likes are there?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of Instagram likes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of likes.\n2. Calculate the number of likes after three weeks.\n3. Determine the number of new likes received recently.\n4. Add the new likes to the initial likes to get the total number of likes.\n\nLet's start with the initial number of likes:\nThe initial number of likes is 2000.\n\nAfter three weeks, the number of likes is 70 times the initial number of likes:\n\\[ 2000 \\times 70 = 140000 \\]\n\nSo, after three weeks, the total number of likes is 140000.\n\nIf she received 20000 more new likes recently, the total number of likes becomes:\n\\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of Instagram likes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{160000} \\]",
    "answer": "After receiving 2000 likes on her photo on Instagram on the first week, Fishio received 70*2000 = <<70*2000=140000>>140000 new likes on the photo after three more weeks.\nThe total number of likes in the four weeks is 140000+2000 = <<140000+2000=142000>>142000\nIf Fishio received 20000 more likes recently, the number of likes on the photo is 142000+20000=<<142000+20000=162000>>162000\n#### 162000"
