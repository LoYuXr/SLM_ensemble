    "question": "Pauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year. The cost of one visit is $2. After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years. How much did Pauline spend on all visits to the museum?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum over the 8 years, we need to calculate the total cost of the visits for each period and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of one visit after 5 years:\n- The original cost of one visit is $2.\n- The cost increased by 150%, which means the new cost is $2 + (150\\% \\times 2) = $2 + $3 = $5.\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of one visit for the next 3 years:\n- The cost of one visit after 5 years is $5.\n- The cost increased by 150%, so the new cost is $5 + (150\\% \\times 5) = $5 + $7.5 = $12.5.\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of the visits for the first 5 years:\n- The cost of one visit for the first 5 years is $5.\n- The total cost for the first 5 years is $5 \\times 5 = $25.\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of one visit for the next 3 years:\n- The cost of one visit for the next 3 years is $12.5.\n- The total cost for the next 3 years is $12.5 \\times 3 = $37.5.\n\nFinally, we sum the total costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years to get the total cost over the 8 years:\n- The total cost is $25 + $37.5 = $62.5.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum over the 8 years is \\(\\boxed{62.5}\\).",
    "answer": "Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.\nThat means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.\nAfter 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.\nThat means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.\nSo for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.\nDuring the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.\nIn total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.\n#### 75"
