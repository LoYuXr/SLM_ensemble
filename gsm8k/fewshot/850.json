    "question": "Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of goats left in the two farms, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of goats sold from Farm X.\n2. Calculate the number of goats sold from Farm Y.\n3. Subtract the number of goats sold from Farm X and Farm Y from the original number of goats in each farm.\n4. Sum the remaining goats from both farms.\n\nLet's start with the goats sold from Farm X:\n- Original number of goats in Farm X: 55\n- Number of goats sold from Farm X: 10\n- Number of goats left in Farm X: \\(55 - 10 = 45\\)\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of goats sold from Farm Y:\n- Original number of goats in Farm Y: 45\n- Number of goats sold from Farm Y: \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\)\n- Number of goats left in Farm Y: \\(45 - 20 = 25\\)\n\nNow, we sum the remaining goats from both farms:\n- Remaining goats in Farm X: 45\n- Remaining goats in Farm Y: 25\n- Total remaining goats: \\(45 + 25 = 70\\)\n\nTherefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).",
    "answer": "There are 55 - 10 = <<55-10=45>>45 goats left in Farm X.\nMr. Smith sold 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 goats from Farm Y.\nThus, 45 - 20 = <<45-20=25>>25 goats are left in Farm Y.\nTherefore, there are a total of 45 + 25 = <<45+25=70>>70 goats left in the two farms altogether.\n#### 70"
