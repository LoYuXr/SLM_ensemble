    "question": "Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. What are their combined weights in pounds?",
    "completion": "To determine the combined weights of Alex and Grace, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find Alex's weight:**\n   - Grace's weight is given as 125 pounds.\n   - Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs.\n   - First, calculate 4 times Grace's weight:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 125 = 500 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n   - Then, subtract 2 pounds from this amount to find Alex's weight:\n     \\[\n     500 - 2 = 498 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the combined weight:**\n   - Add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:\n     \\[\n     125 + 498 = 623 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the combined weight of Alex and Grace is \\(\\boxed{623}\\) pounds.",
    "answer": "Alex weighs 125*4-2 = <<125*4-2=498>>498.\nTheir combined weights are 125+498 = <<125+498=623>>623 pounds.\n#### 623"
