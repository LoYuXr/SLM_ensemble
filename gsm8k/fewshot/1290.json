    "question": "A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds and a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.  How many sunflower seeds are there altogether?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of seeds in the small sunflower.\n2. Determine the number of seeds in the large sunflower.\n3. Add the number of seeds from both the small and large sunflowers.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of seeds in the small sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12 seeds, we have:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ dozen} = 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\text{ seeds} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many seeds are in the large sunflower. The problem states that the large sunflower has 50% more seeds than the small sunflower. This means the large sunflower has 150% of the number of seeds in the small sunflower. To find 150% of 36 seeds, we calculate:\n\\[ 150\\% \\text{ of } 36 = 1.5 \\times 36 = 54 \\text{ seeds} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of seeds from both the small and large sunflowers to get the total number of seeds:\n\\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of sunflower seeds is:\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]",
    "answer": "The small sunflower has 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 seeds.\nThe large sunflower has 36 x 50% = <<36*50*.01=18>>18 more seeds than the small sunflower.\nThe large sunflower has 36 + 18 = <<36+18=54>>54 seeds.\nTogether, the two sunflowers have a total of 36 + 54 = <<36+54=90>>90 seeds.\n#### 90"
