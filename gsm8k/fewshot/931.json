    "question": "The combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years old. Find the age of Peter knowing that Paul is 10 years older than John and that Peter\u2019s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.",
    "completion": "Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \\( P \\), \\( Q \\), and \\( J \\) respectively. We are given the following information:\n\n1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:\n   \\[\n   P + Q + J = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. Paul is 10 years older than John:\n   \\[\n   Q = J + 10\n   \\]\n\n3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and John's ages:\n   \\[\n   P = Q + J\n   \\]\n\nWe need to find the age of Peter, \\( P \\).\n\nFirst, substitute \\( Q \\) from the second equation into the third equation:\n\\[\nP = (J + 10) + J\n\\]\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[\nP = J + 10 + J\n\\]\n\\[\nP = 2J + 10\n\\]\n\nNow we have two equations involving \\( P \\), \\( Q \\), and \\( J \\):\n1. \\( P + Q + J = 100 \\)\n2. \\( P = 2J + 10 \\)\n\nSubstitute \\( P = 2J + 10 \\) into the first equation:\n\\[\n(2J + 10) + Q + J = 100\n\\]\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[\n3J + 10 + Q = 100\n\\]\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\\[\n3J + Q = 90\n\\]\n\nNow we have a new equation involving \\( J \\) and \\( Q \\):\n\\[\n3J + Q = 90\n\\]\n\nWe need to solve for \\( J \\) and \\( Q \\). First, solve for \\( Q \\) in terms of \\( J \\):\n\\[\nQ = 90 - 3J\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( Q = 90 - 3J \\) back into the equation \\( P = 2J + 10 \\):\n\\[\nP = 2J + 10\n\\]\n\nNow we have \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) in terms of \\( J \\):\n\\[\nP = 2J + 10\n\\]\n\\[\nQ = 90 - 3J\n\\]\n\nTo find a specific value for",
    "answer": "Let x be the age of John. Paul\u2019s age is x + 10\nPeter\u2019s age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10\nWe have (2x + 10) + (x + 1) + x = 100\nCombining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100\nSubtracting 20 from both sides and dividing by 4, we get x = 80/4 = 20 years old.\nJohn is 20 years old, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter is 2 * 20 + 10 = 50 years old.\n#### 50"
