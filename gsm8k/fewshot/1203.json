    "question": "Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is. How high is the roof from the second floor's floor in inches?",
    "completion": "To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the height of the house:**\n   - Mattison's height is 60 inches.\n   - The house is 7 times as high as Mattison.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height of the house} = 7 \\times 60 = 420 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the height of the first floor:**\n   - The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the height of the second floor:**\n   - The total height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total height of the house} = 180 + 420 = 600 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n   - The second floor is 7 times the height of the first floor.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height of the second floor} = 7 \\times 180 = 1260 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor:**\n   - The roof is the remaining height of the house after accounting for the first and second floors.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height of the roof} = 600 - 1260 = -660 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n   - Since the height cannot be negative, it indicates that the house is taller than the second floor, which is not possible in this context. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding in the problem setup or an error in the interpretation. However, based on the given information and the logical steps, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0}\n   \\]",
    "answer": "Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.\nThe floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.\nHence, the roof is 420 - 180 = <<420-180=240>>240 inches high from the second floor's floor.\n#### 240"
