    "question": "Cherrie wants to buy Christmas gifts for her 5 friends. 2 of her friends want 5 gifts and the other 3 friends want 2 gifts for themselves. Cherrie goes ahead and buys them and decides to further surprise them by getting 10 more random gifts. How many gifts did Cherrie buy in total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for each friend and then add the additional 10 gifts she bought.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of gifts for each of Cherrie's friends:\n- The first friend wants 5 gifts.\n- The second friend wants 5 gifts.\n- The third friend wants 2 gifts for themselves, so they want \\(2\\) gifts in total.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of gifts for the first three friends is:\n\\[5 + 5 + 2 = 12\\]\n\nNext, we add the additional 10 gifts Cherrie bought:\n\\[12 + 10 = 22\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",
    "answer": "Two of Cherries friends in total want 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 gifts.\nHer other three friends will get 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 gifts in total between them.\nCherrie buys more gifts, leaving a total of 10+6+10=<<10+6+10=26>>26 gifts.\n#### 26"
