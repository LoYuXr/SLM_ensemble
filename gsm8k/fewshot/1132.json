    "question": "Valerie earns $5000 per month, 1/2 of what her brother earns. If their mother earns twice their combined salary, what's the total amount of money they all have together?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Valerie's monthly earnings:**\n   Valerie earns $5000 per month.\n\n2. **Calculate her brother's monthly earnings:**\n   Valerie's brother earns half of what Valerie earns.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Brother's monthly earnings} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5000 = 2500 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the combined monthly earnings of Valerie and her brother:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Combined monthly earnings} = 5000 + 2500 = 7500 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate their mother's monthly earnings:**\n   Their mother earns twice their combined monthly earnings.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mother's monthly earnings} = 2 \\times 7500 = 15000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total monthly earnings of Valerie, her brother, and their mother:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total monthly earnings} = 5000 + 2500 + 15000 = 22500 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total amount of money they all have together:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount} = 22500 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money they all have together is \\(\\boxed{22500}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Valerie's brother earns 2 * $5000 = $<<2*5000=10000>>10000\nTheir combined salary is $5000+$10000 = $<<5000+10000=15000>>15000\nTheir mother earn twice their combined earnings, which is 2*$15000 = $<<2*15000=30000>>30000\nThe total amount of money they all have is $15000+$30000 = $<<15000+30000=45000>>45000\n#### 45000"
