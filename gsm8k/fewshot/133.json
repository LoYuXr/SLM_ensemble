    "question": "On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. His total mileage Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?",
    "completion": "To determine how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of miles Walt walked on Tuesday.\n2. Use the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday.\n\nFirst, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. Therefore, the number of miles he walked on Tuesday is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we know that the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:\n\\[ 41 - 4 - 24 = 13 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nSo, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is:\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]",
    "answer": "Walt\u2019s Tuesday walk was 4*6 = <<4*6=24>>24 miles.\nWalt\u2019s Monday and Tuesday walk were 4+24 = <<4+24=28>>28 miles combined.\nWalt\u2019s Wednesday walk was 41-28 = <<41-28=13>>13 miles.\n#### 13"
