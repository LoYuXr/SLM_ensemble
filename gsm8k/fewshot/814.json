    "question": "A new arcade opens up and Jack decides to play with his 3 friends.  Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes.  Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  One of them is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long.  They play for 4 hours.  How much money is used?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money is used to play the arcade games, we need to calculate the total time spent by Jack and his friends. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Calculate the time Jack spends playing:**\n   - Jack can play a game for 20 minutes.\n   - Jack has 3 friends, and each friend can play for half the time Jack can.\n   - Therefore, each friend can play for \\( \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\) minutes.\n   - Jack and his 3 friends together can play for \\( 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\) minutes.\n\n2. **Calculate the total time spent by Jack and his friends:**\n   - Jack and his friends together can play for 4 hours.\n   - Convert 4 hours to minutes: \\( 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\) minutes.\n   - Add the time Jack spends playing: \\( 240 + 30 = 270 \\) minutes.\n\n3. **Determine the cost of the arcade games:**\n   - The cost of the arcade games is proportional to the time spent playing.\n   - The cost per minute is \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\) dollars.\n   - Therefore, the total cost is \\( 270 \\times \\frac{1}{20} = 13.5 \\) dollars.\n\nThus, the total amount of money used to play the arcade games is \\(\\boxed{13.5}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour\nSo he spends 3*.25=$<<3*.25=.75>>.75 an hour\nHis two friends add change 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 times an hour\nSo they spend 6*.25=$<<6*.25=1.5>>1.5 an hour\nHis last friend puts in money 3/1.5=<<3/1.5=2>>2 times an hour\nSo he spends 2*.25=$<<2*.25=.50>>.50 an hour\nSo in total they spend .75+1.5+.5=$<<.75+1.5+.5=2.75>>2.75 an hour\nSo they spend 2.75*4=$<<2.75*4=11>>11 in the 4 hours\n#### 11"
