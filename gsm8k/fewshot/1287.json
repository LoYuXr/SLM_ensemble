    "question": "In a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?",
    "completion": "To determine the total age of all the siblings, we need to break down the information given and calculate step by step.\n\n1. Identify the ages of the siblings:\n   - There are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.\n   - The older brother is 12 years old.\n   - The younger brother is half the age of the older brother, so the younger brother is \\(12 / 2 = 6\\) years old.\n   - The older sister is 16 years old.\n   - The younger sister is 16 years old.\n\n2. Calculate the total age of the siblings:\n   - The total age of the brothers is \\(12 + 6 + 12 + 12 + 16 + 16 = 72\\).\n   - The total age of the sisters is \\(16 + 16 = 32\\).\n   - Therefore, the total age of all the siblings is \\(72 + 32 = 104\\).\n\nThe total age of all these siblings is \\(\\boxed{104}\\).",
    "answer": "Three sisters are in total 3 * 16 = <<3*16=48>>48 years old.\nThe younger brother is only half the age of the older one, which leads us to the older brother being 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 years old.\nSo all family members in total are 48 + 12 + 24 = <<48+12+24=84>>84 years old.\n#### 84"
