    "question": "A new program had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, but then reduced by 30% in the third month. How many downloads did the program have total over the three months?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then sum them up.\n\n1. **First Month:**\n   The program had 60 downloads.\n\n2. **Second Month:**\n   The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \\times 60 = 180\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Month:**\n   The downloads in the third month were reduced by 30% from the downloads in the second month.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - 0.30 \\times 180 = 180 - 54 = 126\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Downloads Over the Three Months:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total downloads} = \\text{Downloads in the first month} + \\text{Downloads in the second month} + \\text{Downloads in the third month}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of downloads over the three months is \\(\\boxed{366}\\).",
    "answer": "The number of downloads of the program in the second month increased to 3*60 = <<3*60=180>>180\nIn the first two months, the total number of downloads of the program was 180+60 = <<180+60=240>>240\nIn the third month, the number of downloads of the program reduced by 30/100*180 = <<30/100*180=54>>54\nThere were 180-54 = <<180-54=126>>126 downloads in the third month.\nIn the three months, the total number of downloads of the program was 126+240 = <<126+240=366>>366\n#### 366"
