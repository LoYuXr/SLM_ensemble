    "question": "Judy teaches 5 dance classes, every day, on the weekdays and 8 classes on Saturday.  If each class has 15 students and she charges $15.00 per student, how much money does she make in 1 week?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate her earnings from both weekdays and Saturday separately, and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the earnings from the weekdays:\n- Judy teaches 5 dance classes each weekday.\n- Each class has 15 students.\n- She teaches 5 weekdays.\n\nThe total number of classes taught in a week is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ classes/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 25 \\text{ classes} \\]\n\nThe total number of students in these classes is:\n\\[ 25 \\text{ classes} \\times 15 \\text{ students/class} = 375 \\text{ students} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the earnings from Saturday:\n- Judy teaches 8 dance classes on Saturday.\n- Each class has 15 students.\n- She teaches 1 class on Saturday.\n\nThe total number of classes taught in a week is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ class} \\times 1 \\text{ day} = 1 \\text{ class} \\]\n\nThe total number of students in these classes is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ class} \\times 15 \\text{ students/class} = 15 \\text{ students} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total earnings from the weekdays and Saturday:\n- Earnings from weekdays: \\( 25 \\text{ classes} \\times 15 \\text{ students/class} = 375 \\text{ students} \\times \\$15/\\text{student} = \\$5625 \\)\n- Earnings from Saturday: \\( 1 \\text{ class} \\times 15 \\text{ students/class} = 15 \\text{ students} \\times \\$15/\\text{student} = \\$225 \\)\n\nFinally, let's sum up the total earnings for the week:\n\\[ \\$5625 + \\$225 = \\$5850 \\]\n\nTherefore, Judy makes \\(\\boxed{5850}\\) dollars in one week.",
    "answer": "She teaches 5 dance classes 5 days a week so that's 5*5 = <<5*5=25>>25 classes\nShe teaches 25 classes during the week and 8 classes on Saturday for a total of 25+8 = <<25+8=33>>33 classes\nThere are 15 students in each of the 33 classes so there are 15*33 = <<15*33=495>>495 students\nEach student pays $15.00 per class and there are 495 students so Judy makes 15*495 = $<<15*495=7425>>7,425\n#### 7425"
