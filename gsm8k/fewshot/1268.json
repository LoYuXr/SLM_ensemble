    "question": "A tower is made out of 4 blue blocks, twice as many yellow blocks, and an unknown number of red blocks. If there are 32 blocks in the tower in total, how many red blocks are there?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of red blocks in the tower, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.\n\nLet:\n- \\( B \\) be the number of blue blocks.\n- \\( Y \\) be the number of yellow blocks.\n- \\( R \\) be the number of red blocks.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. The tower is made of 4 blue blocks.\n2. The tower is made of twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks.\n3. The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.\n\nWe can express the number of yellow blocks in terms of the number of blue blocks:\n\\[ Y = 2B \\]\n\nThe total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks:\n\\[ B + Y + R = 32 \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\( Y \\) into the total blocks equation:\n\\[ B + 2B + R = 32 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[ 3B + R = 32 \\]\n\nTo find the number of red blocks, we need to determine the value of \\( B \\). Since \\( B \\) is the number of blue blocks, it must be a positive integer. We can solve for \\( R \\) by isolating it in the equation:\n\\[ R = 32 - 3B \\]\n\nSince \\( B \\) must be a positive integer, \\( 32 - 3B \\) must also be a positive integer. This implies:\n\\[ 32 - 3B > 0 \\]\n\\[ 32 > 3B \\]\n\\[ B < \\frac{32}{3} \\]\n\\[ B < 10.67 \\]\n\nSince \\( B \\) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \\( B \\) is 10. We can check if \\( B = 10 \\) satisfies the equation:\n\\[ R = 32 - 3 \\times 10 = 32 - 30 = 2 \\]\n\nSo, if \\( B = 10 \\), then:\n\\[ Y = 2B = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\\[ R = 32 - 3 \\times 10 = 32 - 30 = 2 \\]\n\nThis means the tower has 10 blue blocks, 20 yellow blocks, and 2 red",
    "answer": "There are 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 yellow blocks in the tower.\nThere are 32-4-8 = <<32-4-8=20>>20 red blocks in the tower.\n#### 20"
