    "question": "Tiffany is measuring how many surfers can ride a big wave without falling. She sees that when a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright. Of these riders, 60% are women. If there are 100 riders, how many men can stay upright on the wave?",
    "completion": "To determine how many men can stay upright on the wave, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright:**\n   - The wave is over 30 feet, and only 25% of the riders can stay upright.\n   - There are 100 riders in total.\n   - Therefore, the number of riders who can stay upright is:\n     \\[\n     100 \\times 0.25 = 25\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of women who can stay upright:**\n   - Of these 25 riders, 60% are women.\n   - Therefore, the number of women who can stay upright is:\n     \\[\n     25 \\times 0.60 = 15\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of men who can stay upright:**\n   - The total number of riders is 100.\n   - The number of women who can stay upright is 15.\n   - Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:\n     \\[\n     100 - 15 = 85\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \\(\\boxed{85}\\).",
    "answer": "25 riders stayed upright because 100 x .25 = <<100*.25=25>>25\nOf these riders 10 were men because 25 x .4 = <<25*.4=10>>10\n#### 10"
