    "question": "A car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. A car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. If the car in the fast lane traveled for a total of 480 miles, calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance?",
    "completion": "To determine the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the speed of the car in the slow lane:**\n   The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed of car in the slow lane} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \\text{ miles/hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the distance covered by the car in the slow lane:**\n   The car in the slow lane traveled for a total of 480 miles.\n\n3. **Calculate the time taken by the car in the slow lane:**\n   Time is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{480 \\text{ miles}}{30 \\text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is \\(\\boxed{16}\\) hours.",
    "answer": "At half the speed, the car in the slow lane travels at a speed of 1/2*60 = <<1/2*60=30>>30 miles per hour.\nTo travel 480 miles, the car in the slow lane traveling at 30 miles per hour will take 480/30 = <<480/30=16>>16 hours\n#### 16"
