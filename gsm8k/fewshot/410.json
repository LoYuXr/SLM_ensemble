    "question": "Sally went to the seashore for vacation.  Her parents gave her $10 to buy whatever she wanted.  At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.\"  She scooped up 2 pounds.  She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each.  How much money does Sally have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Sally has left after her purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and then subtract that from the $10 she received from her parents.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the taffy:\n- She bought 2 pounds of taffy.\n- The price of 1 pound of taffy is $3.\n- The price of 1 pound and 1/2 pound of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.\n\nSo, the total cost of the taffy is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$4.50 \\text{ per pound} = \\$9.00 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the mixed bag of seashells:\n- The price of 4 seashells is $1.50 each.\n- The cost of 4 seashells is \\( 4 \\times \\$1.50 = \\$6.00 \\).\n\nSo, the total cost of the seashells is:\n\\[ \\$6.00 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the magnets:\n- She bought 4 magnets, each costing $0.25.\n- The total cost of the magnets is \\( 4 \\times \\$0.25 = \\$1.00 \\).\n\nSo, the total cost of the magnets is:\n\\[ \\$1.00 \\]\n\nNow, let's add up all the costs:\n\\[ \\$9.00 \\text{ (taffy)} + \\$6.00 \\text{ (seashells)} + \\$1.00 \\text{ (magnets)} = \\$16.00 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total cost from the $10 Sally received:\n\\[ \\$10.00 - \\$16.00 = -\\$6.00 \\]\n\nSince the result is negative, it means Sally spent more money than she had. Therefore, she does not have enough money to buy all her purchases. She is short by $6.00.\n\nThe amount of money Sally has left is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-6}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Taffy is buying 1 pound for $3 and gets 1 pound half off. So 1/2 off of 1 pound is $3/2 = $1.50+$3.00=$4.50\n4 magnets at $0.25 each is 4*.25=$<<4*0.25=1.00>>1.00\nWhen you add all her purchases, $4.50+$1.50+$1.00 = $<<4.5+1.5+1=7.00>>7.00\nShe had $10 and spent $7 so she had $10-$7 = $<<10-7=3.00>>3.00 left over\n#### 3"
