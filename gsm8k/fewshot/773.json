    "question": "Anthony had 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, and he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. He kept the remaining pencils. How many pencils did Anthony keep?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem carefully.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of pencils Anthony gave to Brandon:**\n   Anthony had 50 pencils initially. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 50 = 25\n   \\]\n   So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of pencils remaining after giving some to Brandon:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining pencils after giving to Brandon} = 50 - 25 = 25\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of pencils Anthony gave to Charlie:**\n   Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 25 = 15\n   \\]\n   So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of pencils remaining after giving some to Charlie:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining pencils after giving to Charlie} = 25 - 15 = 10\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pencils Anthony kept is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
    "answer": "Brandon received 50 x 1/2 = <<50*1/2=25>>25 pencils\nSo, there were 50 -25 = <<50-25=25>>25 pencils left.\nCharlie got 25 x 3/5 = <<25*3/5=15>>15 pencils.\nThus, Anthony gave away 25 + 15 = <<25+15=40>>40 pencils.\nTherefore, Anthony kept 50 - 40 = <<50-40=10>>10 pencils.\n#### 10"
