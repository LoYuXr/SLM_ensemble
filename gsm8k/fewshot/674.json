    "question": "Mrs. Jameson's bamboo in the backyard grows up to 30 inches a day. Today, its height is 20 feet. In how many days will its height be 600 inches?",
    "completion": "To determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the bamboo's height from feet to inches:**\n   - There are 12 inches in a foot.\n   - Therefore, 20 feet is equal to \\( 20 \\times 12 = 240 \\) inches.\n\n2. **Determine the growth rate of the bamboo:**\n   - The bamboo grows 30 inches per day.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of days required to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches:**\n   - The total growth needed is \\( 600 - 240 = 360 \\) inches.\n   - The growth rate is 30 inches per day.\n   - The number of days required is \\( \\frac{360 \\text{ inches}}{30 \\text{ inches/day}} = 12 \\) days.\n\nThus, it will take \\(\\boxed{12}\\) days for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches.",
    "answer": "Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.\nSo, the bamboo needs to grow 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 inches more.\nTherefore, it will take 360/30 = <<360/30=12>>12 days for its height to be 600 inches.\n#### 12"
