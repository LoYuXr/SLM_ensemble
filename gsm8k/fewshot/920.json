    "question": "Larry loves taking care of animals.  He has 3 cats.  He has 3 times as many dogs as cats.  He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.  He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits.  He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has.  How many pets does Larry have?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet step by step.\n\n1. **Cats:**\n   Larry has 3 cats.\n\n2. **Dogs:**\n   Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 3 = 9\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rabbits:**\n   Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:\n   \\[\n   9 - 2 = 7\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fish:**\n   Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 7 = 21\n   \\]\n\n5. **Gerbils:**\n   Larry has a collection of gerbils that is 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{3} = 7\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum up all the pets:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ (cats)} + 9 \\text{ (dogs)} + 7 \\text{ (rabbits)} + 21 \\text{ (fish)} + 7 \\text{ (gerbils)} = 40\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of pets Larry has is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{40}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Larry has 3 cats and 3 times as many dogs as cats, for 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 dogs\nLarry has 2 fewer rabbits than his 9 dogs, for 9-2=7 rabbits\nLarry has 3 times as many fish as rabbits, for 3*7=<<7*3=21>>21 fish\nLarry has 1 /3 as many gerbils as he has fish, for 21/3= 7 gerbils\nAdding these all together, he has 9+7+21+7+3= <<9+7+21+7+3=47>>47 pets\n#### 47"
