    "question": "An 8-year old child wants to buy a toy car which costs $12. He already has $4 savings. How many days will it take him to save the remaining amount of money if he promises to save $2 daily from his allowance?",
    "completion": "To determine how many days it will take the 8-year-old child to save the remaining amount of money, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the remaining amount of money needed after the initial savings.\n2. Determine how many days it will take to save the remaining amount at a rate of $2 per day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the remaining amount of money:\nThe toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 savings.\n\\[ \\text{Remaining amount} = \\$12 - \\$4 = \\$8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many days it will take to save $8 at a rate of $2 per day.\n\\[ \\text{Number of days} = \\frac{\\$8}{\\$2/\\text{day}} = 4 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nSo, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money.",
    "answer": "The boy still needs $12 - $4 = $<<12-4=8>>8.\nIf he saves $2 per day then it will take him $8 / $2/day = <<8/2=4>>4 days to save the remaining amount.\n#### 4"
