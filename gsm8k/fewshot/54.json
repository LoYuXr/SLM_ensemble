    "question": "The Doubtfire sisters are driving home with 7 kittens adopted from the local animal shelter when their mother calls to inform them that their two house cats have just had kittens. She says that Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, while Trixie, the other cat, has had 12. How many kittens does the Doubtfire family now have?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family has now, we need to calculate the number of kittens each of the two cats, Patchy and Trixie, has and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Patchy's Kittens:**\n   - Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie.\n   - Trixie has had 12 kittens.\n   - Therefore, Patchy has had \\( 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\) kittens.\n\n2. **Trixie's Kittens:**\n   - Trixie has had 12 kittens.\n\n3. **Total Kittens:**\n   - To find the total number of kittens, we add the number of kittens Patchy has to the number of kittens Trixie has.\n   - Total kittens = \\( 36 + 12 = 48 \\).\n\nThus, the Doubtfire family now has a total of 48 kittens.",
    "answer": "Patchy has just had 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 kittens\nSince Trixie's kittens are 12, both cats have 21 +12 = <<21+12=33>>33 kittens.\nCombining the adopted kittens with those from the two cats, the Doubtfire family now has 7 + 33 = <<7+33=40>>40 kittens.\n#### 40"
