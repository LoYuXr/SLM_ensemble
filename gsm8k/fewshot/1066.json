    "question": "The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. The football team ordered twice as many pizzas and ate 80% of them. How many pizzas are left?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pizzas are left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of pizzas ordered by the glee club.\n2. Calculate the number of pizzas ordered by the football team.\n3. Determine how many pizzas were eaten by the glee club.\n4. Determine how many pizzas were eaten by the football team.\n5. Subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered to find the number of pizzas left.\n\nLet's start with the glee club:\n- The glee club ordered 20 pizzas.\n- They ate 70% of them, so the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club is \\(20 \\times 0.70 = 14\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of pizzas ordered by the football team:\n- The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered \\(20 \\times 2 = 40\\) pizzas.\n- They ate 80% of them, so the number of pizzas eaten by the football team is \\(40 \\times 0.80 = 32\\).\n\nNow, we add the number of pizzas eaten by both groups to find the total number of pizzas eaten:\n- Total pizzas eaten = pizzas eaten by the glee club + pizzas eaten by the football team = \\(14 + 32 = 46\\).\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered to find the number of pizzas left:\n- Pizzas left = total pizzas ordered - total pizzas eaten = \\(20 - 46 = -26\\).\n\nSince the number of pizzas left cannot be negative, it means that the glee club ate more pizzas than the football team. Therefore, the number of pizzas left is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",
    "answer": "First find the percentage of pizzas left from the glee club: 100% - 70% = 30%\nThen multiply that percentage by the number of pizzas the glee club ordered to find the number of pizzas left: 30% * 20 pizzas = <<30*.01*20=6>>6 pizzas\nThen multiply the number of pizzas the glee club ordered by 2 to find the number the football team ordered: 20 pizzas * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 pizzas\nThen find the percentage of pizzas left from the football team: 100% - 80% = 20%\nThen multiply that percentage by the number of pizzas the football team ordered to find the number of pizzas left: 20% * 40 pizzas = <<20*.01*40=8>>8 pizzas\nThen add the number of pizzas left from each group to find the total number left: 8 pizzas + 6 pizzas = <<8+6=14>>14 pizzas\n#### 14"
