    "question": "Sasha notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. Since she has leftovers, she decides to sell them. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?",
    "completion": "To determine the profit Sasha makes from selling the leftover lumber, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber:**\n   - Each 2 x 4 x 10 board costs $10.\n   - Sasha has 10 such boards.\n   - Total cost = \\( 10 \\text{ boards} \\times \\$10/\\text{board} = \\$100 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber:**\n   - Each 4 x 4 x 10 board costs $16.\n   - Sasha has 5 such boards.\n   - Total revenue = \\( 5 \\text{ boards} \\times \\$16/\\text{board} = \\$80 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the profit:**\n   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost\n   - Profit = \\$80 - \\$100 = \\(-\\$20\\).\n\nSince the profit is negative, it means Sasha incurs a loss of $20.\n\nTherefore, the profit Sasha makes from selling the leftover lumber is \\(-\\$20\\).",
    "answer": "She bought the 2 x 4s for $100 because 10 x 10 = 100\nShe bought the 4 x 4s for 80 because 5 x 16 = 80\nShe paid $180 for the lumber because 100 + 80 = <<100+80=180>>180\nThe same number now sells for $270 because 180 x 1.5 = <<180*1.5=270>>270\nShe made $90 in profit because 270 - 180 = <<270-180=90>>90\n#### 90"
