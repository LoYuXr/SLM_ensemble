    "question": "Robert wants to buy a bookshelf and a sofa and has received two offers. Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. What is the cost difference between the two offers?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost for Furniture United's offer:\n- Advance payment: $1,350\n- Monthly installments: $350 each, for 6 months\n- Total monthly installment: $350 * 6 = $2,100\n- Total cost for 6 months: $2,100 * 6 = $12,600\n\nSo, the total cost for Furniture United's offer is $12,600.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer:\n- Advance payment: $1,100\n- Monthly installments: $250 each, for 9 months\n- Total monthly installment: $250 * 9 = $2,250\n- Total cost for 9 months: $2,250 * 9 = $20,250\n\nSo, the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer is $20,250.\n\nNow, we find the cost difference between the two offers by subtracting the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from the total cost of Furniture United's offer:\n$12,600 - $20,250 = -$7,650\n\nThe cost difference between the two offers is -$7,650, which means Cozy Homes' offer is cheaper by $7,650.",
    "answer": "Furniture United's offer is 1,350 + (6 *350) = $<<1350+(6*350)=3450>>3,450\nCozy Homes's offer is 1,100 + (9 * 250) = $<<1100+9*250=3350>>3,350\nThe difference is 3,450 \u2013 3,350 = $<<3450-3350=100>>100\n#### 100"
