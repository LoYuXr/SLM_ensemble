    "question": "Janet takes two bus trips five days a week. If each bus trip costs her $2.20, how much would she save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of one bus trip.\n2. Calculate the total cost of five bus trips in one week.\n3. Compare the weekly cost of buying a bus pass to the weekly cost of one bus trip to find the savings.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total cost of one bus trip.\nEach bus trip costs $2.20.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total cost of five bus trips in one week.\nSince Janet takes two bus trips each day, she takes 5 bus trips in a week. Therefore, the total cost of five bus trips in one week is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ trips/day} \\times 2 \\text{ trips/day} \\times \\$2.20/\\text{trip} = 5 \\times 2 \\times 2.20 = 22 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nStep 3: Compare the weekly cost of buying a bus pass to the weekly cost of one bus trip.\nThe weekly cost of buying a bus pass is $20. The weekly cost of one bus trip is $22. Therefore, the savings by buying a weekly bus pass is:\n\\[ \\$22 - \\$20 = \\$2 \\]\n\nSo, Janet would save \\(\\boxed{2}\\) dollars by buying a weekly bus pass.",
    "answer": "First find the total number of trips Janet takes during the week: 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = <<2*5=10>>10 trips/week\nThen multiply this number by the cost per trip to find her current weekly spending: 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $<<10*2.20=22>>22/week\nThen subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from this number to find her savings: $22/week - $20/week = $<<22-20=2>>2\n#### 2"
