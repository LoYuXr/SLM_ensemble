    "question": "At a spa, Iris spent $400 to do her hair, 1/4 as much to do a manicure, and 3/4 as much money as a manicure to do a pedicure. How much money did she spend at the spa?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Cost of Hair:**\n   Iris spent $400 on hair.\n\n2. **Cost of Manicure:**\n   The cost of a manicure is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the cost of hair.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of manicure} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 400 = 100\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of Pedicure:**\n   The cost of a pedicure is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the cost of a manicure.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of pedicure} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 100 = 75\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Cost:**\n   To find the total amount spent at the spa, we sum the costs of all three services.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of hair} + \\text{Cost of manicure} + \\text{Cost of pedicure}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is \\(\\boxed{575}\\).",
    "answer": "The total amount of money that Iris used to do a manicure is 1/4*$400 = $<<1/4*400=100>>100\nTogether, she used $400+$100 = $<<400+100=500>>500 to do her hair and manicure,\nIf Iris also spent 3/4 as much money as a manicure to do a pedicure, she used 3/4*$100 = $<<3/4*100=75>>75 to do a pedicure.\nAt the spa, Iris spent a total of $500+$75 = $<<500+75=575>>575\n#### 575"
