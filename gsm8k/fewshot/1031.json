    "question": "Apple High School is holding graduation in their Fine Arts Center this year which has space for 6000 people.  After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?",
    "completion": "To determine how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of seats available for graduation.\n2. Subtract the number of seats allocated to graduates and faculty.\n3. Divide the remaining seats equally among the graduates.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The total number of seats available for graduation is 6000.\n2. The number of seats allocated to graduates is 950.\n3. The number of seats allocated to faculty is 300.\n\nFirst, we subtract the seats allocated to graduates and faculty from the total number of seats:\n\n\\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4650 \\]\n\nSo, there are 4650 seats available for graduation.\n\nNext, we divide the remaining seats equally among the graduates:\n\n\\[ 4650 \\div 600 = 7.75 \\]\n\nSince we cannot split a ticket into fractions, each graduate would receive 7 full tickets, and there would be 3 tickets left over. However, the problem asks for the number of tickets each graduate would receive to give to their friends and family, which means we should consider the whole number part of the division.\n\nTherefore, each graduate would receive 7 tickets to give to their friends and family.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates\nMinus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 6000 - 1250 = <<6000-1250=4750>>4750 remaining seats.\nDivide amount of graduates by remaining seats. 4750/950 = <<4750/950=5>>5 tickets\n#### 5"
