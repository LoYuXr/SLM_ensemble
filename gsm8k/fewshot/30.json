    "question": "Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. If their total age now is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.",
    "completion": "To determine Allen's age 10 years from now, we start by understanding the given ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages, which is 7:11. This means that for every 7 parts Darrell has, Allen has 11 parts.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of parts in the ratio:\n\\[ 7 + 11 = 18 \\text{ parts} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many parts Darrell has. Since the total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, we can find the value of one part by dividing 162 by 18:\n\\[ \\text{Value of one part} = \\frac{162}{18} = 9 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nNow, we can find out how many years Allen has been alive. Since Allen has 11 parts, we multiply the value of one part by 11:\n\\[ \\text{Allen's age in 10 years} = 11 \\times 10 = 110 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nTherefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:\n\\[ \\boxed{110} \\]",
    "answer": "The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18\nSince the fraction of the ratio that represents Allen's age is 11/18, Allen's current age is 11/18*162 = <<11/18*162=99>>99\nIf Allen is currently 99 years old, in 10 years he will be 99+10 = <<99+10=109>>109 years old\n#### 109"
