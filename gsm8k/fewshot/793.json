    "question": "Jamie earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work each day. Should she need to work additional hours, she is paid a special hourly rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate. Last Tuesday, she worked 11 hours. How much was she paid, in dollars, for her work that day?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Jamie earned for her work on Tuesday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Jamie's regular hourly rate.\n2. Determine the special hourly rate.\n3. Calculate the total earnings for the 11 hours of work on Tuesday.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Jamie's regular hourly rate. Jamie earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work each day. Therefore, her regular hourly rate is:\n\\[\n\\text{Regular hourly rate} = \\frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \\text{ dollars per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out the special hourly rate. The special hourly rate is 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find 150% of $2.5, we multiply $2.5 by 1.50:\n\\[\n\\text{Special hourly rate} = 2.5 \\times 1.50 = 3.75 \\text{ dollars per hour}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the total earnings for the 11 hours of work on Tuesday. The total earnings are the special hourly rate multiplied by the number of hours worked:\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings} = 3.75 \\times 11 = 41.25 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jamie was paid \\(\\boxed{41.25}\\) dollars for her work that day.",
    "answer": "The first 8 hours pay 20*8=<<20*8=160>>160.\nThe overtime hourly rate is 1.50*20=$<<1.50*20=30>>30/hr.\nShe worked 11-8=<<11-8=3>>3 overtime hours\nThen the additional 3 hours pay 3*30=<<3*30=90>>90.\nShe was paid 160+90=<<160+90=250>>250.\n#### 250"
