    "question": "Luke is spending time at the beach building sandcastles. He eventually notices that each level of a sandcastle will have half the square footage as the level below it. If he makes a 4 leveled sandcastle where the top level has a square footage of 16, what is the average square footage of a level?",
    "completion": "To determine the average square footage of a level of the sandcastle, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the square footage of each level of the sandcastle.\n2. Calculate the average square footage by summing the square footage of all levels and dividing by the number of levels.\n\nGiven:\n- The top level has a square footage of 16.\n- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.\n\nLet's denote the square footage of the sandcastle at each level as follows:\n- Level 1: \\( x \\)\n- Level 2: \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\)\n- Level 3: \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\)\n- Level 4: \\( \\frac{x}{8} \\)\n\nWe know that the top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{8} = 16 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve for \\( x \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 8:\n\\[ x = 16 \\times 8 \\]\n\\[ x = 128 \\]\n\nNow that we have the square footage of the top level, we can find the square footage of each level:\n- Level 1: \\( x = 128 \\)\n- Level 2: \\( \\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{128}{2} = 64 \\)\n- Level 3: \\( \\frac{x}{4} = \\frac{128}{4} = 32 \\)\n- Level 4: \\( \\frac{x}{8} = \\frac{128}{8} = 16 \\)\n\nNext, we calculate the average square footage of a level by summing the square footage of all levels and dividing by the number of levels:\n\\[ \\text{Average square footage} = \\frac{128 + 64 + 32 + 16}{4} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average square footage} = \\frac{240}{4} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average square footage} = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, the average square footage of a level is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
    "answer": "Level 3 is 32 square feet because 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32\nLevel 2 is 64 square feet because 32 x 2 = <<32*2=64>>64\nLevel 1 is 128 square feet because 64 x 2 = <<64*2=128>>128\nThe four levels total to 240 square feet because 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = <<128+64+32+16=240>>240\nThe average square footage of a level is 60 because 240 / 4 = <<240/4=60>>60\n#### 60"
