    "question": "If Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?",
    "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much fence each person gets and then find out how much is left over for Sam.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( S \\) be the amount of fence Sam gets.\n   - Let \\( H \\) be the amount of fence Harry gets.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations:**\n   - Sam and Harry together have 100 feet of fence:\n     \\[\n     S + H = 100\n     \\]\n   - Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam:\n     \\[\n     H = S + 60\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute the Second Equation into the First:**\n   - Substitute \\( H = S + 60 \\) into \\( S + H = 100 \\):\n     \\[\n     S + (S + 60) = 100\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     2S + 60 = 100\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( S \\):**\n   - Subtract 60 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     2S = 40\n     \\]\n   - Divide by 2:\n     \\[\n     S = 20\n     \\]\n\n5. **Find \\( H \\):**\n   - Substitute \\( S = 20 \\) back into \\( H = S + 60 \\):\n     \\[\n     H = 20 + 60 = 80\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the Remaining Fencing for Sam:**\n   - Subtract the total amount of fence from Sam:\n     \\[\n     S - H = 20 - 80 = -60\n     \\]\n\nSince the result is negative, it indicates that Sam does not have enough fence to cover the entire 100 feet. Therefore, Sam is left with 60 feet of fence.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
    "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100\nSubtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.\n#### 20"
