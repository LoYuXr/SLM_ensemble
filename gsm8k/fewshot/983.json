    "question": "Charlie has boots that are five times the size of Sophie's. If Sophie wears size five boots, what is the average size of shoe worn by the two?",
    "completion": "To determine the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the size of Sophie's boots.\n2. Calculate the size of Charlie's boots.\n3. Find the average size of the two pairs of boots.\n\nLet's denote the size of Sophie's boots as \\( S \\). According to the problem, Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's boots, so the size of Charlie's boots is \\( 5S \\).\n\nNext, we need to find the average size of the two pairs of boots. The average size is calculated by adding the sizes of the two pairs and then dividing by 2.\n\nThe size of Sophie's boots is \\( S \\), and the size of Charlie's boots is \\( 5S \\). Therefore, the average size of the two pairs of boots is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average size} = \\frac{S + 5S}{2} = \\frac{6S}{2} = 3S\n\\]\n\nSo, the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is \\(\\boxed{3S}\\).",
    "answer": "If Sophie wears size five shoes, Charlie wears 5 * shoe size 5 = shoe size <<5*5=25>>25\nTheir combined shoes size for the two is shoe size 25 + shoe size 5 = <<25+5=30>>30\nThe average for the shoe size the two wear is shoe size 30/2 = shoe size <<30/2=15>>15\n#### 15"
