    "question": "Josh runs a car shop and services 3 cars a day.  He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday.  He gets paid $4 per car.  How much does he make in 2 weeks?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of days Josh is open in a week.\n2. Determine the number of days Josh is open in 2 weeks.\n3. Calculate the total number of cars he services in 2 weeks.\n4. Calculate the total amount of money he makes from servicing the cars.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many days Josh is open in a week. Since he is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday, he is open for 6 days a week.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of days he is open in 2 weeks:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ days/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 12 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNow, we know that Josh services 3 cars per day. Therefore, the total number of cars he services in 12 days is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ cars/day} \\times 12 \\text{ days} = 36 \\text{ cars} \\]\n\nJosh gets paid $4 per car. So, the total amount of money he makes is:\n\\[ 36 \\text{ cars} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars/car} = 144 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Josh makes in 2 weeks is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{144}\n\\]",
    "answer": "He runs 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 days a week\nThat means he serves 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 cars a week\nSo he makes 15*4=$<<15*4=60>>60 a week\nSo he makes 60*2=$<<60*2=120>>120 in 2 weeks\n#### 120"
