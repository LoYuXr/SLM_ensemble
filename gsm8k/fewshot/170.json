    "question": "The marching band is ordering new uniforms. Each uniform comes with a hat that costs $25, a jacket that costs three times as much as the hat, and pants that cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. How much does each uniform cost total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component of the uniform and then sum these costs.\n\n1. **Cost of the hat:**\n   The cost of the hat is given as $25.\n\n2. **Cost of the jacket:**\n   The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \\times 25 = 75\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of the pants:**\n   The cost of the pants is the average of the cost of the hat and the jacket. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of the pants} = \\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total cost of the uniform:**\n   To find the total cost of the uniform, we sum the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total cost of each uniform is \\(\\boxed{150}\\).",
    "answer": "First find the cost of the jacket: $25 * 3 = $<<25*3=75>>75\nThen add the cost of the jacket and hat: $25 + $75 = $<<25+75=100>>100\nThen divide that amount by 2 to find the average cost, which is the cost of the pants: $100 / 2 = $<<100/2=50>>50\nThen add the cost of each item of clothing to find the total cost of the uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $<<25+75+50=150>>150\n#### 150"
