    "question": "The three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. One angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle. What is the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, in degrees?",
    "completion": "To determine the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we start by defining the angles in terms of a variable. Let the smallest angle be \\( x \\) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so this angle is \\( 2x \\) degrees. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so this angle is \\( 3x \\) degrees.\n\nThe sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\nx + 2x + 3x = 180\n\\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[\n6x = 180\n\\]\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{180}{6} = 30\n\\]\nSo, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The angles of the triangle are 30 degrees, \\( 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\) degrees, and \\( 3 \\times 30 = 90 \\) degrees. The largest angle is the one that is not the smallest, which is 90 degrees.\n\nThus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \\(\\boxed{90}\\) degrees.",
    "answer": "Let x be the measure of the smallest angle\nx+2x+3x=180\n6x=180\nx=<<30=30>>30\nThen the largest angle is 3*30=<<3*30=90>>90 degrees.\n#### 90"
