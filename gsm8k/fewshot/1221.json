    "question": "Aiden is making his famous steakhouse-seasoned meatballs for a neighborhood cookout. He adds two tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef he uses. He gets sixteen meatballs from each pound of meat. If he wants to make 80 meatballs for the cookout, how much of his secret seasoning will he need?",
    "completion": "To determine how much of Aiden will need of his secret seasoning, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the amount of meatballs per tablespoon of seasoning:**\n   Aiden adds two tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 16 meatballs, the amount of seasoning needed is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{16 \\text{ meatballs}}{2 \\text{ tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat}} = 8 \\text{ tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of seasoning needed for 80 meatballs:**\n   Since Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs, we multiply the amount of seasoning per pound by the number of pounds:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ tablespoons of seasoning per pound} \\times 80 \\text{ pounds of meat} = 640 \\text{ tablespoons of seasoning}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Aiden will need \\boxed{640} tablespoons of his secret seasoning.",
    "answer": "To make 80 meatballs, Aiden will need 80 / 16 = <<80/16=5>>5 pounds of meat.\nAiden will need 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs.\n#### 10"
