    "question": "The ice cream parlor was offering a deal, buy 2 scoops of ice cream, get 1 scoop free.  Each scoop cost $1.50.  If Erin had  $6.00, how many scoops of ice cream should she buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin should buy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of scoops she can get with the deal:**\n   - The deal is \"buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free.\"\n   - This means for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2 scoops.\n   - If she has $6.00, we need to find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can get.\n\n2. **Determine the cost per scoop:**\n   - Each scoop costs $1.50.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost for 3 scoops:**\n   - Since she gets 1 scoop free for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2 scoops.\n   - The total cost for 3 scoops is \\(3 \\times 1.50 = 4.50\\) dollars.\n\n4. **Determine how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:**\n   - Erin has $6.00.\n   - She can get \\(6.00 / 4.50 = 1.33\\) sets of 3 scoops.\n   - Since she can only buy whole scoops, she can get 1 set of 3 scoops.\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of scoops she can get:**\n   - For 1 set of 3 scoops, she gets 2 scoops.\n   - For 1 set of 3 scoops, she gets 1 scoop.\n   - Therefore, she can get \\(2 + 1 = 3\\) scoops in total.\n\nSo, Erin should buy \\(\\boxed{3}\\) scoops of ice cream.",
    "answer": "Each scoop cost $1.50. If she buys 2, she gets one free. So it will cost her 2 * 1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00 for thee scoops total.\nIf you break it down, 3 scoops of ice cream cost $3.00 so 3/3 = $<<3/3=1.00>>1.00 per scoop\nErin has $6.00 and each scoop ends up costing $1.00 each then 6/1 = <<6/1=6>>6 scoops total\n#### 6"
