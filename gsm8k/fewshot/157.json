    "question": "Blake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?",
    "completion": "To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we need to calculate the total distance each runner runs and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance Blake runs:\n- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.\n- Each back and forth run is 100 yards.\n- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:\n  \\[\n  15 \\times 100 = 1500 \\text{ yards}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total distance Kelly runs:\n- Kelly runs back and forth once.\n- Each back and forth run is 100 yards.\n- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is:\n  \\[\n  1 \\times 100 = 100 \\text{ yards}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how much farther the winner (Blake) runs than the loser (Kelly):\n- Blake runs 1500 yards.\n- Kelly runs 100 yards.\n- The difference in distance is:\n  \\[\n  1500 - 100 = 1400 \\text{ yards}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the winner runs \\(\\boxed{1400}\\) yards farther than the loser.",
    "answer": "Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200\nHe runs 3000 yards in total because 200 x 15 = <<200*15=3000>>3000\nKelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200\nShe runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80\nShe runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720\nShe runs 2920 in total because 2720 + 200 = <<2720+200=2920>>2920\nBlake won because 3000 > 2920\nThe winner ran 80 yards more than the loser because 3000 - 2920 = <<3000-2920=80>>80\n#### 80"
