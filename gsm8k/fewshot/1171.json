    "question": "Tom has 4 bedrooms in his house.  They measure 20 by 12 feet each.  The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom.  The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.  What is the total area, in square feet, of the house?",
    "completion": "To determine the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of each bedroom, the area of the living room, and then sum these areas with the area of the rest of the house.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ feet} = 240 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the area of the living room:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the living room} = 5 \\times 240 \\text{ square feet} = 1200 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nNow, we know the rest of the house is 1000 square feet. We can find the total area of the house by adding the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:\n\\[\n\\text{Total area of the house} = \\text{Area of one bedroom} + \\text{Area of the living room} + \\text{Area of the rest of the house}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total area of the house} = 240 \\text{ square feet} + 1200 \\text{ square feet} + 1000 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total area of the house} = 2400 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total area of the house is \\(\\boxed{2400}\\) square feet.",
    "answer": "The bedrooms are each 20*12=<<20*12=240>>240 square feet\nSo in total the bedrooms are 240*4=<<240*4=960>>960 square feet\nThe living room is 240*5=<<240*5=1200>>1200 square feet\nSo in total the house is 1200+1000+960=<<1200+1000+960=3160>>3160 square feet\n#### 3160"
