    "question": "Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later?",
    "completion": "To determine the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years ago:**\n   Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.\n\n2. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**\n   Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago. Therefore, his salary four years later is:\n   \\[\n   40,000 \\times (1 + 0.40) = 40,000 \\times 1.40 = 56,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:**\n   Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,000.\n\n4. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**\n   Lylah's salary increased by 30% from four years ago. Therefore, her salary four years later is:\n   \\[\n   30,000 \\times (1 + 0.30) = 30,000 \\times 1.30 = 39,000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**\n   Add their salaries together:\n   \\[\n   56,000 + 39,000 = 95,000\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is \\(\\boxed{95000}\\).",
    "answer": "Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.\nIn total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000\nIf four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.\nFour years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000\nAfter receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200\nIn total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.\nThe total amount of salary the two earn four years later is $39200+$56000 = $<<39200+56000=95200>>95200\n#### 95200"
