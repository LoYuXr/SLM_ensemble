    "question": "Jamaar loves fresh fruit and is headed to the store with $10 he earned mowing lawns. Including tax, peaches and pears are $.5 each, apples are $.75 each, kiwis are $1, and plums cost $.25 each. If he has already purchased 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples, how many plums can he buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased and then subtract that from his initial $10.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the fruits already purchased:**\n   - 3 peaches: \\(3 \\times 0.5 = 1.5\\) dollars\n   - 4 pears: \\(4 \\times 0.5 = 2\\) dollars\n   - 2 kiwis: \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) dollars\n   - 5 apples: \\(5 \\times 0.75 = 3.75\\) dollars\n\n2. **Sum the costs of the fruits already purchased:**\n   \\[\n   1.5 + 2 + 2 + 3.75 = 9.25 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the remaining amount of money Jamaar has:**\n   \\[\n   10 - 9.25 = 0.75 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many plums can be bought with the remaining $0.75:**\n   - 1 plum costs $0.25\n   \\[\n   \\frac{0.75}{0.25} = 3 \\text{ plums}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jamaar can buy \\(\\boxed{3}\\) plums.",
    "answer": "He has spent $3.5 on peaches and pears because 7 x .5 = <<7*.5=3.5>>3.5\nHe has spent $2 on kiwis because 2 x 1 = <<2*1=2>>2\nHe has spent $3.75 on apples because 5 x .75 = <<5*.75=3.75>>3.75\nHe has already spent $9.25 because 3.5 + 2 + 3.75 = <<3.5+2+3.75=9.25>>9.25\nHe can buy three plums because .75 / .25 = <<.75/.25=3>>3\n#### 3"
