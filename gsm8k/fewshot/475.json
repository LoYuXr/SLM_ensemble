    "question": "It takes 240 minutes of walking to break in a new pair of shoes. Jason wants to try out for the track team in three weeks. If he can walk 4 days a week to break in the new shoes, how long does he have to spend walking each day?",
    "completion": "To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of days in three weeks.\n2. Determine how many days Jason needs to walk to break in the new pair of shoes.\n3. Calculate the number of days Jason has to walk each day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of days in three weeks:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ weeks} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 21 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Jason can walk 4 days a week to break in the new shoes. Therefore, the number of days he needs to walk to break in the shoes is:\n\\[ 21 \\text{ days} \\div 4 \\text{ days/week} = 5.25 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nSince Jason wants to break in the shoes in three weeks, we need to find out how many days he has to walk each day. We do this by dividing the total number of days by the number of weeks:\n\\[ 21 \\text{ days} \\div 3 \\text{ weeks} = 7 \\text{ days/week} \\]\n\nSo, Jason has to spend walking each day for:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ days/week} \\div 4 \\text{ days/week} = 1.75 \\text{ days/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of days Jason has to spend walking each day is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1.75} \\]",
    "answer": "First find how many days Jason has to prepare for the tryouts: 3 weeks * 4 days/week = <<3*4=12>>12 days\nThen divide the time it takes to break the shoes in by the time Jason can spend each day to find how long he needs to walk each day: 240 minutes / 12 days = <<240/12=20>>20 minutes/day\n#### 20"
