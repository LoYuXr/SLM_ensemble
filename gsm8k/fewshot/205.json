    "question": "Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert gives six tests each semester. He allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester. If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of 93?",
    "completion": "To determine the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93:**\n   The average is calculated by dividing the total sum of all scores by the number of tests. Let \\( S \\) be the total sum of all scores and \\( n \\) be the number of tests. The average is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average} = \\frac{S}{n}\n   \\]\n   We want the average to be 93, so:\n   \\[\n   93 = \\frac{S}{6}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( S \\):\n   \\[\n   S = 93 \\times 6 = 558\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total sum of the first five tests:**\n   Brinley's scores on the first five tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The sum of these scores is:\n   \\[\n   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 448\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total sum of all six tests:**\n   The total sum of all six tests is the sum of the first five tests plus the sixth test:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total sum} = 448 + \\text{Score on the sixth test}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set up the equation to find the score on the sixth test:**\n   We know the total sum of all six tests is 558, so:\n   \\[\n   558 = 448 + \\text{Score on the sixth test}\n   \\]\n   Solving for the score on the sixth test:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Score on the sixth test} = 558 - 448 = 110\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Brinley needs to score \\(\\boxed{110}\\) on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.",
    "answer": "First, identify the lowest score, which is 71, and remove it.\nSince Brinley wants a score of 93, we know her total score needs to be 93 (average) * 5 (tests) = <<93*5=465>>465 points\nSo far, Brinley has earned 89 + 92 +100 + 86 = <<89+92+100+86=367>>367 points\nThe final test must be 465 - 367 = <<465-367=98>>98 points.\n#### 98"
