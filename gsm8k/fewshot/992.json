    "question": "Buford writes many checks every year.  Once per month he writes a check to pay the electric bill.  He also writes a check every month for the gas bill.  Twice per month he writes a check to the church.  And quarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service.  How many checks does Buford write per year?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Electric Bill Checks:**\n   Buford writes a check every month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Electric checks} = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Gas Bill Checks:**\n   Buford writes a check every month for the gas bill. There are 12 months in a year.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gas checks} = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Church Checks:**\n   Buford writes a check twice per month to the church. There are 12 months in a year.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Church checks} = 12 \\times 2 = 24\n   \\]\n\n4. **Pest and Lawn Service Checks:**\n   Buford writes a check quarterly to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pest and lawn service checks} = 4\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum up all the checks:\n\\[\n\\text{Total checks} = \\text{Electric checks} + \\text{Gas checks} + \\text{Church checks} + \\text{Pest and lawn service checks}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total checks} = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is \\boxed{52}.",
    "answer": "Once per month he writes a check to pay the electric bill, or 1*12=<<1*12=12>>12 checks each year.\nHe also writes a check every month for the gas bill, or 1*12-12 checks each year.\nTwice per month he writes a check to the church, or 2*12-24 checks each year.\nQuarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service, or 1*4=<<1*4=4>>4 checks each year.\nIn total, Buford writes 12+12+24+4=<<12+12+24+4=52>>52 checks per year.\n#### 52"
