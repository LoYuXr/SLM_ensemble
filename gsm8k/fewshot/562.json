    "question": "The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house. The sun is moving at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house. If the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves for 10 hours, how many degrees will there be from the ground to the sun?",
    "completion": "To determine how many degrees the sun will be from the ground to the tip of the pyramid after 10 hours, we need to consider the angle of the sun's movement relative to the ground. The sun's movement is described as 5 degrees per hour, and it starts at the tip of the pyramid.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total angle the sun has moved in 10 hours:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ degrees/hour} \\times 10 \\text{ hours} = 50 \\text{ degrees} \\]\n\nSince the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, the angle from the ground to the tip of the pyramid is the same as the angle the sun has moved. Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun is:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ degrees} \\]\n\nSo, the sun will be \\(\\boxed{50}\\) degrees from the ground to the tip of the pyramid after 10 hours.",
    "answer": "5 degrees an hour for 10 hours 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 degrees\nthe pyramid is 32 degrees from the ground so 32+50=<<32+50=82>>82 degrees\n#### 82"
