    "question": "The ratio of men to women on a bus is 5:9. If the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, and 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, how many women have remained on the bus?",
    "completion": "To determine how many women have remained on the bus after 20 women alight, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the initial number of men and women on the bus:**\n   The ratio of men to women is 5:9. Let the number of men be \\(5x\\) and the number of women be \\(9x\\). The total number of passengers on the bus is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   5x + 9x = 84\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   14x = 84\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(x\\), we divide both sides by 14:\n   \\[\n   x = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the number of men is \\(5x = 5 \\times 6 = 30\\) and the number of women is \\(9x = 9 \\times 6 = 54\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the number of women who alight:**\n   If 20 women alight, the number of women remaining on the bus is:\n   \\[\n   54 - 20 = 34\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of women who have remained on the bus is \\(\\boxed{34}\\).",
    "answer": "The total ratio representing the number of women on the bus is 5+9=<<5+9=14>>14\nThe fraction from the ratio representing the number of women is 9/14, and since the total number of passengers representing the full ratio is 84, there are 9/14*84=<<9/14*84=54>>54 women on the bus.\nIf 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus becomes 54-20=<<54-20=34>>34\n#### 34"
