    "question": "Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. If Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, how long will they be in feet?",
    "completion": "To determine the total length of all the baked goods Bill bakes in feet, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of rolls baked in inches.\n2. Convert the total number of rolls from inches to feet.\n3. Calculate the total number of croissants baked in inches.\n4. Convert the total number of croissants from inches to feet.\n5. Calculate the total number of baguettes baked in inches.\n6. Convert the total number of baguettes from inches to feet.\n\nLet's start with the rolls:\n\n1. Bill bakes 300 rolls every day.\n2. Each roll is 4 inches long.\n3. Therefore, the total length of the rolls in inches is:\n   \\[\n   300 \\text{ rolls} \\times 4 \\text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we convert the rolls from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide the total length in inches by 12:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1200 \\text{ inches}}{12 \\text{ inches/foot}} = 100 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's move to the croissants:\n\n4. Bill bakes 120 croissants every day.\n5. Each croissant is 6 inches long.\n6. Therefore, the total length of the croissants in inches is:\n   \\[\n   120 \\text{ croissants} \\times 6 \\text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we convert the croissants from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide the total length in inches by 12:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{720 \\text{ inches}}{12 \\text{ inches/foot}} = 60 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes:\n\n7. Bill bakes 60 baguettes every day.\n8. Each baguette is 2 feet long.\n9. Therefore, the total length of the baguettes in feet is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ baguettes} \\times 2 \\text{ feet/baguette} = 1",
    "answer": "First find the total length of the rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = <<300*4=1200>>1200 inches\nThen find the total length of the croissants: 120 rolls * 6 inches/roll = <<120*6=720>>720 inches\nThen add the length of the rolls and croissants to find the total length in inches: 1200 inches + 720 inches = <<1200+720=1920>>1920 inches\nThen divide the total length by 12 inches per foot to find the length in feet: 1920 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1920/12=160>>160 feet\nThen find the total length of the baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = <<60*2=120>>120 feet\nThen add the length of the other baked goods in feet to find the total length: 120 feet + 160 feet = <<120+160=280>>280 feet\n#### 280"
