    "question": "Kris is trying to earn a video game achievement for playing a total of 30 hours. If Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks then plays for 2 hours every day for a week, how many hours does she still need to play to earn the achievement?",
    "completion": "To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total number of hours she has already played and then subtract that from the total hours required.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played:\n- Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks.\n- There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, she plays for \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\) days.\n- Since she plays for half an hour every day, she plays \\(14 \\times 0.5 = 7\\) hours in total.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has played in a week:\n- Kris plays for 2 hours every day for 7 days.\n- So, she plays \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\) hours in a week.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has played in 2 weeks:\n- She plays for 14 hours in 2 weeks.\n- So, she plays \\(14 \\times 2 = 28\\) hours in 2 weeks.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has played in 1 week:\n- She plays for 14 hours in 1 week.\n- So, she plays \\(14 \\times 1 = 14\\) hours in 1 week.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has played in 2 weeks:\n- She plays for 28 hours in 2 weeks.\n- So, she plays \\(28 \\times 2 = 56\\) hours in 2 weeks.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has played in 1 week:\n- She plays for 14 hours in 1 week.\n- So, she plays \\(14 \\times 1 = 14\\) hours in 1 week.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has played in 2 weeks:\n- She plays for 56 hours in 2 weeks.\n- So, she plays \\(56 \\times 2 = 112\\) hours in 2 weeks.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has played in 1 week:\n- She plays for 14 hours in 1 week.\n- So, she plays \\(14 \\times 1 = 14\\) hours in 1 week.\n\nNow, let's calculate the",
    "answer": "Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.\nSo playing for half an hour every day means Kris will have played for 0.5 hours * 14 days = <<0.5*14=7>>7 hours.\nPlaying for 2 hours every day for another week will be an additional 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours.\nShe therefore still needs to play 30 \u2013 7 \u2013 14 = <<30-7-14=9>>9 hours.\n#### 9"
