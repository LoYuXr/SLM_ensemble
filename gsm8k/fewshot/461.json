    "question": "Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. If Frederick has 10 plants, how many plants does Shondra have?",
    "completion": "To determine how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Determine how many plants Toni has:**\n   Frederick has 10 plants. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of plants Toni has} = 10 + 0.60 \\times 10 = 10 + 6 = 16\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many plants Shondra has:**\n   Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of plants Shondra has} = 16 - 7 = 9\n   \\]\n\nThus, Shondra has \\(\\boxed{9}\\) plants.",
    "answer": "Toni has 10 * 0.60 = <<10*0.60=6>>6 more plants than Frederick\nToni has a total of 10 + 6 = <<10+6=16>>16 plants\nShondra has 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 plants.\n#### 9"
