    "question": "Jaime is a computer programmer for a company that currently has employed 100 people. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. If the number of Junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and they are each paid $2000 per month, calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.",
    "completion": "To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of junior programmers.\n2. Calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers.\n3. Calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers.\n4. Sum the monthly salaries of junior and senior programmers to get the total monthly salary for all programmers.\n\nLet's start with the number of junior programmers. We know that the number of junior programmers is \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) of the total number of employees. The total number of employees is 100, so the number of junior programmers is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of junior programmers} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 100 = 40\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers. Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month, so the total monthly salary for all junior programmers is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total monthly salary for junior programmers} = 40 \\times 2000 = 80000\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:\n\\[\n2000 + 400 = 2400 \\text{ dollars per month}\n\\]\nThe total monthly salary for all senior programmers is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total monthly salary for senior programmers} = 40 \\times 2400 = 96000\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the monthly salaries of junior and senior programmers to get the total monthly salary for all programmers:\n\\[\n\\text{Total monthly salary for all programmers} = 80000 + 96000 = 176000\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{176000}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The number of junior programmers in the company is 2/5*100 = <<2/5*100=40>>40\nThe total amount of money that the company pays to the Junior employees is $2000*40 = $<<2000*40=80000>>80000\nThere are also 100-40 = <<100-40=60>>60 senior programmers in the company.\nThe senior programmers are paid $2000+$400 = $<<2000+400=2400>>2400 each.\nSenior programmers at the company receive 2400*60 = $<<2400*60=144000>>144000 combined.\nAll the programmers in the company are paid a combined salary of 144000+80000 = <<144000+80000=224000>>224000\n#### 224000"
