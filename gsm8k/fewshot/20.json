    "question": "I have 10 liters of orange drink that are two-thirds water and I wish to add it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. But as I pour it, I spill one liter of the orange drink. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?",
    "completion": "To determine how much water is in the remaining 24 liters of orange drink after adding it to the 15 liters of pineapple drink, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial amount of water in the orange drink:**\n   The orange drink is two-thirds water. Therefore, the amount of water in the orange drink is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} \\times 10 \\text{ liters} = \\frac{20}{3} \\text{ liters} \\approx 6.67 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink after adding it to the pineapple drink:**\n   The total amount of water in the orange drink is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{3} \\text{ liters} + \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ liters} = \\frac{22}{3} \\text{ liters} \\approx 7.33 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink after adding the orange drink:**\n   The pineapple drink is three-fifths water. Therefore, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{5} \\times 15 \\text{ liters} = 9 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount of water in the 24 liters of orange drink after adding the pineapple drink:**\n   The total amount of water in the 24 liters of orange drink is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{22}{3} \\text{ liters} + 9 \\text{ liters} = \\frac{22}{3} \\text{ liters} + \\frac{27}{3} \\text{ liters} = \\frac{49}{3} \\text{ liters} \\approx 16.33 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of orange drink:**\n   The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of orange drink is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{49}{3} \\text{ liters} - \\frac{22}{3} \\text{ liters} = \\frac{27}{3} \\text{ liters} = 9 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of",
    "answer": "There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.\nAfter 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.\nOut of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.\n#### 15"
