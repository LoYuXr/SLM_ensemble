    "question": "Sue lives in a fun neighborhood.  One weekend, the neighbors decided to play a prank on Sue.  On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard.  On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put these newly painted white flamingos back out on Sue's front yard.  Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?",
    "completion": "Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many more pink plastic flamingos are out than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday.\n\n1. **Initial Count:**\n   - On Friday morning, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos.\n\n2. **Flamingos Taken Back:**\n   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.\n   - One third of 18 is \\( \\frac{18}{3} = 6 \\).\n   - So, 6 flamingos were taken back.\n   - After taking back the flamingos, the number of flamingos left is \\( 18 - 6 = 12 \\).\n\n3. **Flamingos Painted White:**\n   - The newly painted white flamingos were added on Saturday morning.\n   - The number of new white flamingos added is 18.\n   - So, the total number of flamingos now is \\( 12 + 18 = 30 \\).\n\n4. **Flamingos Added on Sunday:**\n   - On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.\n   - So, the total number of flamingos now is \\( 30 + 18 = 48 \\).\n\n5. **Comparison:**\n   - The number of pink plastic flamingos is 48.\n   - The number of white plastic flamingos is 12.\n   - The difference is \\( 48 - 12 = 36 \\).\n\nTherefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 36 more pink plastic flamingos out than white plastic flamingos.",
    "answer": "On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.\nThis left 18 pink - 6 = <<18-6=12>>12 pink flamingos.\nOn Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, for a total of 12 + 18 = <<12+18=30>>30 pink flamingos on the front lawn.\nAltogether, there were 30 pink and 6 white flamingos on the lawn, so there were 30 pink - 6 white =<<30-6=24>>24 more pink flamingos.\n#### 24"
