    "question": "Luke is buying fabric for new curtains. There are five windows. Each window is 35 inches wide and Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. How much fabric should he buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how much fabric Luke should buy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total width of the five windows.\n2. Multiply the total width by 2 to find the amount of fabric needed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total width of the five windows. Each window is 35 inches wide, so the total width is:\n\\[ 35 \\text{ inches/window} \\times 5 \\text{ windows} = 175 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much fabric Luke should buy. Since he needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2:\n\\[ 175 \\text{ inches} \\times 2 = 350 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of fabric Luke should buy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{350} \\]",
    "answer": "The total width of the five windows is 35 x 5 = <<35*5=175>>175 inches.\nLuke needs to buy 175 x 2 = <<175*2=350>>350 inches of fabric.\n#### 350"
