    "question": "There are four schools competing at a basketball tournament. Each school has sent a girls\u2019 basketball team and a boys\u2019 basketball team and each team has 5 players each. Each school has also sent a coach for each team. In total, how many people have all of the schools sent?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of people who have all of the schools sent, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for each school and then sum them up.\n\n1. Each school has a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team, and each team has 5 players. Therefore, each school has a total of \\(5 + 5 = 10\\) players.\n2. Each school also has a coach for each team. Since there are 2 teams per school, each school has a total of \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) coaches.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of people by adding the number of players and coaches for all the schools:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of people} = (\\text{Number of schools}) \\times (\\text{Number of players per school}) + (\\text{Number of schools}) \\times (\\text{Number of coaches per school})\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of people} = 4 \\times 10 + 4 \\times 10 = 40 + 40 = 80\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who have all of the schools sent is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",
    "answer": "Each school has sent 1 girls\u2019 basketball team + 1 boys\u2019 basketball team = <<1+1=2>>2 teams.\nSo each school has sent 2 teams * 5 players per team = <<2*5=10>>10 players.\nThey have also each sent 2 teams * 1 coach per team = <<2*1=2>>2 coaches.\nIn total, each school has sent 10 players + 2 coaches = <<10+2=12>>12 people.\nTherefore, the schools have sent a total of 12 people per school * 4 schools = <<12*4=48>>48 people.\n#### 48"
