    "question": "In a room, there are various toys: 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll. The doll cost as much as 3 action figures and one red car cost $4. How much are all toys worth, of an action figure costs $5?",
    "completion": "To determine the total value of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of the action figures. We know that one red car costs $4 and the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Therefore, the cost of one action figure is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of one action figure} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of one red car}}{3} = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the red cars. There are 5 red cars, so the total cost of the red cars is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of red cars} = 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of the action figures. There are 3 action figures, so the total cost of the action figures is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of action figures} = 3 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThe doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so the cost of the doll is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum up the costs of all the toys to find the total value:\n\\[\n\\text{Total value of all toys} = \\text{Total cost of red cars} + \\text{Total cost of action figures} + \\text{Cost of the doll} = 20 + 4 + 4 = 28 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total value of all the toys is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{28}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Three actions figures are worth 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15, as much as the doll.\nThe red cars are worth 5 * 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.\nSo all toys are worth 20 + 15 + 15 = $<<20+15+15=50>>50.\n#### 50"
