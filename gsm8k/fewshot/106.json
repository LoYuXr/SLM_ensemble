    "question": "John has 3 boxes.  Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.  The walls are 1 inch thick.  What is the total inner volume of all 3 boxes?",
    "completion": "To determine the total inner volume of all three boxes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the volume of one box.\n2. Determine the inner volume of one box after accounting for the 1-inch thick walls.\n3. Multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all three boxes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the volume of one box. The dimensions of one box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The volume \\( V \\) of a rectangular box is given by the formula:\n\\[ V = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{height} \\]\nSo, the volume of one box is:\n\\[ V = 5 \\times 6 \\times 4 = 120 \\text{ cubic inches} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the inner volume of one box after accounting for the 1-inch thick walls. The inner volume \\( V_{\\text{inner}} \\) of a box is the volume of the box minus the volume of the walls. The volume of the walls is the sum of the volumes of the three rectangular faces that are not walls. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner volume is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{inner}} = V - 3 \\times \\text{height} \\]\nwhere the height of the box is 4 inches. Therefore, the inner volume is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{inner}} = 120 - 3 \\times 4 = 120 - 12 = 108 \\text{ cubic inches} \\]\n\nFinally, to find the total inner volume of all three boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:\n\\[ V_{\\text{total}} = 3 \\times 108 = 324 \\text{ cubic inches} \\]\n\nThus, the total inner volume of all three boxes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{324} \\]",
    "answer": "The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension\nSo each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width\nIt also has a 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 inch height\nFinally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth\nSo the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches\nSo in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches\n#### 72"
