    "question": "Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and the total cost of buying the asphalt, and then find the difference between these two amounts.\n\n1. **Cost of fixing the pothole:**\n   - The pothole will cause $450 worth of damage to Ron's car.\n   - The city council will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance.\n   - Therefore, the total cost of fixing the pothole is:\n     \\[\n     450 + 120 = 570 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Cost of buying the asphalt:**\n   - Each bucket of asphalt costs $25.\n   - Ron needs 3 buckets of asphalt.\n   - Therefore, the total cost of buying the asphalt is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 25 = 75 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total cost of fixing the pothole and buying the asphalt:**\n   - Adding the cost of fixing the pothole and the cost of buying the asphalt gives:\n     \\[\n     570 + 75 = 645 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Money saved by fixing the pothole:**\n   - The total cost of fixing the pothole is $570.\n   - The total cost of buying the asphalt is $75.\n   - Therefore, the amount of money saved by fixing the pothole is:\n     \\[\n     570 - 75 = 495 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Ron saves \\(\\boxed{495}\\) dollars by fixing the pothole.",
    "answer": "First find the total cost of the asphalt by multiplying the number of buckets by the cost per bucket: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $<<3*25=75>>75\nNow subtract the cost of the asphalt and the fine from the cost of the damage Ron avoids: $450 - $75 - $120 = $<<450-75-120=255>>255\n#### 255"
