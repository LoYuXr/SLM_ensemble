    "question": "There are 9,300 pennies in a cup. What is the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup?",
    "completion": "To determine the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of pennies in the stack.\n2. Convert the number of pennies into dollars.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup. Two-thirds of these pennies will be in the stack. So, we calculate two-thirds of 9,300:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 9300\n\\]\n\nTo perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 9300 = \\frac{2 \\times 9300}{3} = \\frac{18600}{3} = 6200\n\\]\n\nSo, the stack contains 6,200 pennies.\n\nNext, we need to convert the number of pennies into dollars. Since there are 100 pennies in a dollar, we divide the number of pennies by 100:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total dollar amount} = \\frac{6200}{100} = 62\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is \\boxed{62}.",
    "answer": "A third of the pennies in a cup is 9,300/3 = <<9300/3=3100>>3,100.\nNumber of pennies in the stack is 3,100*2 = <<3100*2=6200>>6,200.\nTotal dollar amount in the stack is 6,200/100 = <<6200/100=62>>62.\n#### 62"
