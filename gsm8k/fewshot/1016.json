    "question": "Mrs. Tatiana owns a grocery store that sells different fruits and vegetables, which includes carrots. The price of carrots in the grocery store increases by 5% of the original price every year. What would be the price of carrots after three years if it was $120 initially? (Round to the nearest integer)",
    "completion": "To determine the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase year by year. The price of carrots increases by 5% of the original price every year. Let's start with the initial price of carrots, which is $120.\n\n1. **Year 1:**\n   The price of carrots after the first year is:\n   \\[\n   120 \\times (1 + 0.05) = 120 \\times 1.05 = 126\n   \\]\n\n2. **Year 2:**\n   The price of carrots after the second year is:\n   \\[\n   126 \\times (1 + 0.05) = 126 \\times 1.05 = 132.3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Year 3:**\n   The price of carrots after the third year is:\n   \\[\n   132.3 \\times (1 + 0.05) = 132.3 \\times 1.05 = 139.465\n   \\]\n\nRounding $139.465 to the nearest integer, we get $139.\n\nTherefore, the price of carrots after three years is \\(\\boxed{139}\\).",
    "answer": "In the first year, the price of carrots increases by 5/100*120 = $<<5/100*120=6>>6\nAfter 3 years, the price of carrots will increase by $6*3 = $<<6*3=18>>18\nThe total price of carrots after three years will be 120+18 = $<<120+18=138>>138\n#### 138"
