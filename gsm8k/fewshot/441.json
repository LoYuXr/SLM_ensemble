    "question": "Two sisters, Elizabeth and Margareth, bought beads. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads, while Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. How many more beads do one sister have than the other, if each pack of beads contains 20 pieces of beads?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more beads Elizabeth has than Margareth, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth has:\n- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.\n- Each pack contains 20 beads.\n- Therefore, the total number of beads Elizabeth has is:\n  \\[\n  1 \\times 20 + 2 \\times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth has:\n- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.\n- Each pack contains 20 beads.\n- Therefore, the total number of beads Margareth has is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 20 + 4 \\times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140\n  \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the number of beads Elizabeth has and the number of beads Margareth has:\n\\[\n60 - 140 = -80\n\\]\n\nSince the question asks how many more beads Elizabeth has than Margareth, and the result is negative, it means Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-80}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 packs.\nSo Elizabeth bought 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 pieces of beads.\nMargareth bought 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 packs.\nSo Margareth bought 7 x 20 = <<7*20=140>>140 pieces of beads.\nTherefore, Margareth bought 140 - 60 = <<140-60=80>>80 more beads than Elizabeth.\n#### 80"
