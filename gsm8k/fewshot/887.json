    "question": "Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes, 2/3rd of that number of birds flying overhead, and 3 groups of eight birds each feeding. How many birds does he count in total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate each part separately.\n\n1. **Count the initial birds in the bushes:**\n   Jerry counts 6 birds in the bushes.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of birds flying overhead:**\n   Jerry counts \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the number of birds in the bushes flying overhead. So, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 = 4\n   \\]\n   Therefore, 4 birds are flying overhead.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of birds feeding in total:**\n   Jerry counts 3 groups of eight birds each. So, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 8 = 24\n   \\]\n   Therefore, 24 birds are feeding in total.\n\n4. **Add up all the birds:**\n   Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, the birds flying overhead, and the birds feeding:\n   \\[\n   6 + 4 + 24 = 34\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total number of birds Jerry counts is \\(\\boxed{34}\\).",
    "answer": "First find how many birds are flying overhead: 6 birds * 2/3 = <<6*2/3=4>>4 birds\nThen find how many birds are feeding: 3 groups * 8 birds/group = <<3*8=24>>24 birds\nThen add the number of nesting birds and flying birds to find the total number of birds: 4 birds + 24 birds + 6 birds = <<4+24+6=34>>34 birds\n#### 34"
