    "question": "Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. If Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, and Dora is 15 years old, calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.",
    "completion": "To determine the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Dora's father's age.\n2. Use the information about Dora's father's age to find Dora's father's age.\n3. Use the information about Dora's mother's age to find Dora's mother's age.\n4. Sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.\n\nFirst, we know that Dora is 15 years old. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate Dora's father's age as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Dora's father's age} = 2 \\times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we calculate Dora's mother's age as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Dora's mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:\n\\[ \\text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is \\(\\boxed{87}\\).",
    "answer": "If Dora's age is 15, her father, with eight more than twice Dora's age, is eight more than 15*2 = <<15*2=30>>30 years.\nThis means Dora's father is 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 years old.\nTogether, Dora and her father have a total age of 38+15 =<<38+15=53>>53.\nDora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, meaning Dora's mother is 38-4 = 34 years old.\nAltogether, Dora's family has a total age of 53+34 = <<53+34=87>>87 years.\n#### 87"
