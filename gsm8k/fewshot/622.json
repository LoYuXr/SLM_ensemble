    "question": "Jim has a 20 pack of gum.  He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school over a school day that lasts 8 hours.  He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner.  He also gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister when she asks for some right before bed.  How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pieces of gum chewed during the school day:**\n   - Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school.\n   - He spends 8 hours at school.\n   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of gum chewed is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{8 \\text{ hours}}{2 \\text{ hours per piece}} = 4 \\text{ pieces}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of pieces of gum chewed after home:**\n   - Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home.\n   - He chews 1 piece of gum after dinner.\n   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of gum chewed after home is:\n     \\[\n     1 \\text{ piece} + 1 \\text{ piece} = 2 \\text{ pieces}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of gum chewed before giving to his sister:**\n   - Jim gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister.\n   - He has 20 pieces of gum initially.\n   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of gum given to his sister is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{20 \\text{ pieces}}{2} = 10 \\text{ pieces}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day:**\n   - Subtract the total number of pieces chewed from the initial amount:\n     \\[\n     20 \\text{ pieces} - 20 \\text{ pieces} = 0 \\text{ pieces}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",
    "answer": "Jim goes to school for 8 hours, so if he chews 1 stick of gum every 2 hours that means he chews 8/2= <<8/2=4>>4 sticks of gum\nJim chews 1 stick on the way home, plus 2 sticks after dinner for a total of 1+1=2 sticks of gum\nHis sister asks for half his remaining gum. Jim started with 20 and has chewed 6, so he has 20-6=<<20-6=14>>14 sticks left\nThis means Jim gives her 14/2=<<14/2=7>>7 sticks of gum\nJim had 20 sticks of gum to begin with, and gave away 4+2+7=13 sticks away\nThis means Jim has 20-13= <<20-13=7>>7 sticks of gum remaining.\n#### 7"
