    "question": "If there are 10 eggs in a basket, and there are twice as many eggs in a second basket, how many eggs are in both baskets put together?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of eggs in the first basket.\n2. Calculate the number of eggs in the second basket.\n3. Add the number of eggs in both baskets together.\n\nStep 1: Identify the number of eggs in the first basket.\nThe first basket contains 10 eggs.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of eggs in the second basket.\nThe second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket. Therefore, the number of eggs in the second basket is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nStep 3: Add the number of eggs in both baskets together.\nThe total number of eggs in both baskets is:\n\\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
    "answer": "If there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as the 10 in the first basket, this means we multiply 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 eggs in the second basket\nTo find the total between the two baskets, simply add 10+20=<<10+20=30>>30 eggs between the two baskets.\n#### 30"
