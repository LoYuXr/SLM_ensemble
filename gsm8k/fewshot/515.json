    "question": "Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. She painted them and sold them at a craft fair for $8 each. How much profit did she earn on her bags?",
    "completion": "To determine Tara's profit, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.\n2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags.\n3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 bags each, so the total number of bags is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\text{ bags} \\]\nThe cost of each bag is $4, so the total cost is:\n\\[ 40 \\times 4 = 160 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is:\n\\[ 40 \\times 8 = 320 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:\n\\[ 320 - 160 = 160 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Tara's profit is:\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]",
    "answer": "The total number of bags is 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40\nThe cost of the 40 bags is 40*4 = <<40*4=160>>160\nTara sold the 40 bags at 8 each earning her 40*8 = <<40*8=320>>320\nHer profit was 320-160 = <<320-160=160>>160\n#### 160"
