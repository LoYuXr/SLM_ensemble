    "question": "Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank account.  He loses 10 bills while getting home.  After that, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.  Thomas then triples his money.  He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  How many 5 dollar bills does he have?",
    "completion": "Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many 5 dollar bills Thomas has.\n\n1. **Initial Withdrawal:**\n   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.\n\n2. **Loss of 10 Bills:**\n   He loses 10 bills, so he now has:\n   \\[\n   1000 - 10 \\times 20 = 1000 - 200 = 800 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Use of Half of the Remaining Bills:**\n   He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Since he has 800 dollars left, he uses:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{800}{2} = 400 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   So, he has:\n   \\[\n   800 - 400 = 400 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conversion to 5 Dollar Bills:**\n   Thomas then converts all his remaining 400 dollars into 5 dollar bills. Since he has 400 dollars, he can convert it into:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{400}{5} = 80 \\text{ 5 dollar bills}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{80}\n\\]",
    "answer": "He withdrew 1000/20=<<1000/20=50>>50 bills\nSo he has 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 bills left over\nHe uses half the bills to pay for something, so he has 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 bills\nHe triples his money which gives him 20*3=<<20*3=60>>60 bills\nSo he has 60*20=$<<60*20=1200>>1200\nConverting to 5s means he has 1200/5=<<1200/5=240>>240 bills\n#### 240"
