    "question": "Jaime places eggs on the tray. Each tray can hold 24 eggs. If he has 64 eggs and 2 trays, how many eggs won't he be able to place on the tray?",
    "completion": "To determine how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays.\n2. Subtract the number of eggs that can be placed from the total number of eggs Jaime has.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays. Since each tray can hold 24 eggs and Jaime has 2 trays, we multiply the number of trays by the number of eggs each tray can hold:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ trays} \\times 24 \\text{ eggs/tray} = 48 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of eggs that can be placed from the total number of eggs Jaime has:\n\\[ 64 \\text{ eggs} - 48 \\text{ eggs} = 16 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of eggs that Jaime won't be able to place on the tray is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
    "answer": "Jaime will be able to place a total of 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.\nTherefore, there are 64 - 48 = <<64-48=16>>16 eggs that he won't be able to place on the tray.\n#### 16"
