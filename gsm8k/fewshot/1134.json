    "question": "Jane has saved $4 of her allowance every week for the past 8 weeks. If she continues to save the same amount each week, how many more weeks will it take for her to have saved a total of $60?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to have saved a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much money she has saved in the past 8 weeks.\n\nJane saves $4 every week. Therefore, in 8 weeks, she will have saved:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 8 \\text{ weeks} = 32 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much more money she needs to save to reach $60. We do this by subtracting the amount she has already saved from $60:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ dollars} - 32 \\text{ dollars} = 28 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining $28. Since she saves $4 every week, we divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings:\n\\[ 28 \\text{ dollars} \\div 4 \\text{ dollars/week} = 7 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jane \\(\\boxed{7}\\) more weeks to have saved a total of $60.",
    "answer": "She has already saved 8 * $4 = $<<8*4=32>>32.\nShe needs to save an additional $60 - $32 = $<<60-32=28>>28.\nIt will take her 28 / 4 = <<28/4=7>>7 more weeks to save the rest of the money.\n#### 7"
