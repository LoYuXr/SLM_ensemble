    "question": "Mr. Tan sold his house for $400 000. He paid the transfer fees that amount to 3% of the selling price and also paid a brokerage fee that is 5% of the selling price. If he also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?",
    "completion": "To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house, we need to calculate the total expenses and then subtract them from the selling price.\n\n1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**\n   The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \\times 400,000 = 12,000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**\n   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \\times 400,000 = 20,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total expenses:**\n   Add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total expenses} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the remaining loan amount:**\n   Mr. Tan paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining loan amount} = 250,000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the net proceeds:**\n   Subtract the total expenses from the remaining loan amount.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net proceeds} = 250,000 - 32,000 = 218,000\n   \\]\n\nThus, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are \\(\\boxed{218000}\\).",
    "answer": "Mr. Tan paid $400 000 x 3/100 = $12 000 for the transfer fees.\nHe paid $400 000 x 5/100 = $20 000 for the brokerage fee.\nSo, Mr. Tan paid a total of $12 000 + $20 000 + $250 000 = $282 000 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.\nHence, Mr. Tan's net proceeds is $400 000 - $282 000 = $118 000.\n#### 118000"
