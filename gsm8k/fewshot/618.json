    "question": "The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. There are 18 seats in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. How many students were there in the school auditorium?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium.\n2. Determine the number of seats occupied by the administrators.\n3. Calculate the number of seats remaining after accounting for the administrators.\n4. Determine the number of seats occupied by the parents.\n5. Calculate the number of seats remaining after accounting for the parents.\n6. Determine the number of seats occupied by the students.\n7. Calculate the total number of students in the auditorium.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total seats} = 4 \\text{ rows} \\times 18 \\text{ seats per row} = 72 \\text{ seats}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the number of seats occupied by the administrators:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Seats occupied by administrators} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 72 = 18 \\text{ seats}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the number of seats remaining after accounting for the administrators:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Seats remaining} = 72 - 18 = 54 \\text{ seats}\n   \\]\n\n4. Determine the number of seats occupied by the parents:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Seats occupied by parents} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 54 = 18 \\text{ seats}\n   \\]\n\n5. Calculate the number of seats remaining after accounting for the parents:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Seats remaining} = 54 - 18 = 36 \\text{ seats}\n   \\]\n\n6. Determine the number of seats occupied by the students:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Seats occupied by students} = 36 \\text{ seats}\n   \\]\n\n7. Calculate the total number of students in the auditorium:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of students} = 36 \\text{ seats} = 36 \\text{ students}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of students in the school auditorium is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
    "answer": "There are 4 x 18 = <<4*18=72>>72 seats in the school auditorium.\n72 x1/4 = <<72*1/4=18>>18 seats were occupied by the administrators.\nThere were 72 - 18 = <<72-18=54>>54 seats not occupied by the administrators.\n54 x 1/3 = <<54*1/3=18>>18 seats were occupied by the parents.\nSo, 54 - 18 = <<54-18=36>>36 seats were occupied by the students.\n#### 36"
