    "question": "Candy has a chair rental business. During the weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day; but during weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. If this continues, how many chairs in total will Candy be able to rent out in two 4-week months?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in one weekday:\n- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.\n- There are 5 weekdays in a week.\n- Therefore, the number of chairs rented in one weekday is:\n  \\[\n  60 \\text{ chairs/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 300 \\text{ chairs/week}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in one weekend day:\n- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.\n- There are 2 weekend days in a week.\n- Therefore, the number of chairs rented in one weekend day is:\n  \\[\n  100 \\text{ chairs/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days/week} = 200 \\text{ chairs/week}\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in one week:\n- The total number of chairs rented in one week is the sum of the chairs rented in weekdays and weekends:\n  \\[\n  300 \\text{ chairs/week} + 200 \\text{ chairs/week} = 500 \\text{ chairs/week}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in two weeks:\n- The total number of chairs rented in two weeks is the total number of chairs rented in one week multiplied by 2:\n  \\[\n  500 \\text{ chairs/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 1000 \\text{ chairs}\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1000}\n\\]",
    "answer": "During weekdays, a total of 60 x 5 = <<60*5=300>>300 chairs are rented.\nDuring the weekends, a total of 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200 chairs are rented.\nIn a week, 300 + 200 = <<300+200=500>>500 chairs are rented.\nSince there are 4 weeks in a month, 500 x 4 = <<500*4=2000>>2000 chairs are rented in a month.\nThus, a total of 2000 x 2 = <<2000*2=4000>>4000 chairs are rented in two months.\n#### 4000"
