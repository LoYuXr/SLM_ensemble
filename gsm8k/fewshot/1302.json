    "question": "Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. He wants to sell them for a fair price. He found a buyer who is willing to pay for half his collection $5 per toy, and for the other half $7 per toy. If Matthew would agree to that offer, how much money would he earn?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Matthew would earn by selling his toy soldiers at the given prices, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of toy soldiers:**\n   Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers.\n\n2. **Determine the price per toy for the first half:**\n   The buyer is willing to pay half of Matthew's collection for each toy.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price per toy for the first half} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the price per toy for the second half:**\n   The buyer is willing to pay half of Matthew's collection for each toy.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price per toy for the second half} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all the toys:**\n   Matthew sells each toy for $5.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total revenue} = 12 \\text{ toys} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars/toy} = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, if Matthew agrees to the offer, he would earn **$60**.",
    "answer": "Half of Matthew collection means 12 * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 toy soldiers.\nA buyer wants to buy 6 toy soldiers for $5, so he would pay 6 * 5 = $<<6*5=30>>30 for them.\nAnd for the other half, he wants to pay $7 per toy, which would sum up to 6 * 7 = $<<6*7=42>>42.\nSo if Matthew would agree to the buyer's offer, he would earn 30 + 42 = $<<30+42=72>>72.\n#### 72"
