    "question": "Bob has a certain number of marbles. If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, how many marbles will Bob have?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the number of marbles Bob currently has as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to \\( 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\) marbles. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have:\n\\[ x + 24 \\]\nWe are given that after receiving the 24 marbles, Bob will have 60 marbles. So we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ x + 24 = 60 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 60 - 24 \\]\n\\[ x = 36 \\]\n\nSo, Bob currently has 36 marbles. Next, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of the marbles he has. If Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have:\n\\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10 of them is \\(\\boxed{26}\\).",
    "answer": "Let B be the number of marbles Bob starts with.\n2 dozen marbles is 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 marbles.\nSo after receiving 2 dozen more marbles, we know B + 24 = 60.\nThis means B = 60 - 24 = <<60-24=36>>36.\nBob ends with 36 - 10 = <<36-10=26>>26 marbles.\n#### 26"
