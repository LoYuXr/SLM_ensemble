    "question": "A chef bought 4 bags of onions. Each bag weighs 50 pounds. A pound of onions cost $1.50. How much did the chef spend?",
    "completion": "To determine how much the chef spent on the onions, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of the onions.\n2. Determine the cost per pound of onions.\n3. Calculate the total cost by multiplying the total weight by the cost per pound.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of the onions. The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ bags} \\times 50 \\text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the cost per pound. The cost of onions is $1.50 per pound. So, the cost per pound is:\n\\[ \\frac{1.50 \\text{ dollars}}{200 \\text{ pounds}} = 0.0075 \\text{ dollars per pound} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total weight by the cost per pound:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ pounds} \\times 0.0075 \\text{ dollars per pound} = 1.50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the chef spent:\n\\[ \\boxed{1.50} \\]",
    "answer": "A bag of onions cost $1.50 x 50 = $<<1.5*50=75>>75.\nTherefore, the chef spent $75 x 4 = $<<75*4=300>>300 for the four bags of onions.\n#### 300"
