    "question": "$18 is shared among 3 boys. The eldest added $5 to his share and added another $10 the following day. He later needed some money and spent $8 from his total so far. After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. How much does he have now?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the initial amount of money each boy has as \\( x \\). Since there are 3 boys, the total initial amount of money is \\( 3x \\).\n\nThe eldest boy adds $5 to his share and then adds another $10 the following day. So, his new total amount is:\n\\[ x + 5 + 10 = x + 15 \\]\n\nThe eldest boy then spends $8, so his new total amount is:\n\\[ x + 15 - 8 = x + 7 \\]\n\nAfter spending $8, the eldest boy has $7 left. According to the problem, after saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. Let's denote the amount he saved as \\( y \\). So, after saving \\( y \\), he has:\n\\[ 7 + y \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, this amount is three times the amount he had left after spending $8. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 7 + y = 3 \\times 7 \\]\n\\[ 7 + y = 21 \\]\n\\[ y = 14 \\]\n\nSo, the amount he saved is $14. Now, we can find out how much he has now by adding the $14 he saved to the $7 he had left after spending $8:\n\\[ 7 + 14 = 21 \\]\n\nThus, the amount he has now is:\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]",
    "answer": "Each boy gets $18/3 = $<<18/3=6>>6.\nThe eldest had $5+$6=$<<5+6=11>>11 after adding $5 to his share.\nHe added another $10 so he had $11+$10=$<<11+10=21>>21.\nThen he had $21-$8=$<<21-8=13>>13 after spending $8.\nSo, he now has $13*3=$<<13*3=39>>39.\n#### 39"
