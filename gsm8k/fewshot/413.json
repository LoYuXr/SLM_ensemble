    "question": "Marcy makes homemade candles that she markets as 99% guaranteed not to explode. 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. If she makes 50000 candles, how many of them will both smell like wet dog and explode?",
    "completion": "To determine how many of the 50000 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of candles that are 99% guaranteed not to explode:**\n   \\[\n   50000 \\times 0.99 = 49500 \\text{ candles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of candles that are 99% guaranteed to explode:**\n   \\[\n   50000 \\times 0.01 = 500 \\text{ candles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of candles that are both 99% guaranteed not to explode and 99% guaranteed to explode:**\n   \\[\n   49500 - 500 = 49000 \\text{ candles}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is \\(\\boxed{49000}\\).",
    "answer": "First find what percentage of the candles explode: 100% - 99% = 1%\nThen multiply the odds of the candles exploding by the odds of them smelling like wet dog to find the probability of both events happening: 1% * 5% = 0.05%\nThen multiply that percentage by the number of candles to find the number of them that have both defects: 0.05% * 50000 candles = <<0.05*.01*50000=25>>25 candles\n#### 25"
