    "question": "Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?",
    "completion": "To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then figure out how many years it will take to cover this net profit.\n\n1. **Calculate the net profit per year:**\n   - The tree grows 7 lemons each year.\n   - Each lemon is sold for $1.5.\n   - Therefore, the net profit per year is:\n     \\[\n     7 \\text{ lemons} \\times \\$1.5 \\text{ per lemon} = \\$10.50\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total cost to plant the tree:**\n   - The cost to plant the tree is $90.\n\n3. **Calculate the total profit needed to start earning money:**\n   - The total profit needed to start earning money is the net profit per year multiplied by the number of years:\n     \\[\n     \\$10.50 \\text{ per year} \\times 1 \\text{ year} = \\$10.50\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of years required to earn the total profit:**\n   - The total cost to plant the tree is $90, and the net profit per year is $10.50. Therefore, the number of years required to earn the total profit is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\$90}{\\$10.50 \\text{ per year}} = 8 \\text{ years}\n     \\]\n\nThus, it will take Carlos \\boxed{8} years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.",
    "answer": "He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5\nHe earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5\nIt will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12\nHe will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13\n#### 13"
