    "question": "A bird decides to leave her summer home in the north and travel to her winter home in the south.  To make the journey, the bird leaves her home flying in a southerly direction for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.  Then, the bird turns direction and flies towards the north for 2 hours are a speed of 18 miles per hour.  Finally, the bird changes direction and flies toward the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour before landing at her southern home.  What is the distance, in miles, between the bird's northern and the southern homes?",
    "completion": "To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird and then subtract the distance it traveled in the south direction.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction:\n- The bird flies for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.\n- Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 30 miles/hour \u00d7 10 hours = 300 miles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance traveled in the north direction:\n- The bird flies for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.\n- Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 18 miles/hour \u00d7 2 hours = 36 miles.\n\nThen, let's calculate the distance traveled in the south direction:\n- The bird flies for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.\n- Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 22 miles/hour \u00d7 5 hours = 110 miles.\n\nNow, we sum up the distances traveled in all three directions:\n- Total distance = Distance in southerly direction + Distance in north direction + Distance in south direction = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles.\n\nTherefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles.",
    "answer": "Flying for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, the bird travels 10*30=<<10*30=300>>300 miles in a southerly direction.\nFlying for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour, the bird travels 2*18=<<2*18=36>>36 miles in a northerly direction.\nAnd flying for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour, the bird travels 5*22=<<5*22=110>>110 miles in a southerly direction.\nAltogether, the distance between the bird's two homes is 300-36+110=<<300-36+110=374>>374 miles\n#### 374"
