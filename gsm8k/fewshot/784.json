    "question": "Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG (miles per gallon). If the current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, how much money is Andy's car consuming per week if he only uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday and the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the weekly mileage:**\n   - Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday.\n   - The one-way distance is 5 miles.\n   - There are 5 days in a week.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly mileage} = 5 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 25 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the weekly fuel consumption:**\n   - Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 MPG (miles per gallon).\n   - The fuel cost is $3 per gallon.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly fuel consumption} = \\frac{\\text{Weekly mileage}}{\\text{Fuel efficiency}} \\times \\text{Fuel cost per gallon}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly fuel consumption} = \\frac{25 \\text{ miles}}{10 \\text{ MPG}} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/gallon}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perform the calculation:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly fuel consumption} = \\frac{25}{10} \\times 3 = 2.5 \\times 3 = 7.5 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Andy's car is consuming \\(\\boxed{7.5}\\) gallons of gas per week.",
    "answer": "Between Monday to Friday there are 5 days\nIf the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles the total round trip distance Andy drives daily is 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 miles\nThat means he drives a total of 10 miles * 5 days = <<10*5=50>>50 miles per week\nIf his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, then his car is consuming a total of 50 miles / 10 MPG = <<50/10=5>>5 gallons of gas each week\nGiven that each gallon of gas costs $3, then his car is consuming 5 * $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15 worth of gas each week\n#### 15"
