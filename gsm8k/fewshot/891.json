    "question": "A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. How fast does a whirligig spin?",
    "completion": "To determine the speed at which a whirligig spins, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the speed of a thingamabob:**\n   A thingamabob spins at 1 meter per second (m/s).\n\n2. **Determine the speed of a whirligig:**\n   A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 1 \\, \\text{m/s} = 5 \\, \\text{m/s}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the speed of a whatchamacallit:**\n   A whatchamacallit spins at eleven times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whatchamacallit is:\n   \\[\n   11 \\times 1 \\, \\text{m/s} = 11 \\, \\text{m/s}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the speed of a whirligig compared to a whatchamacallit:**\n   A whirligig spins at 5 meters per second, while a whatchamacallit spins at 11 meters per second. The difference in their speeds is:\n   \\[\n   11 \\, \\text{m/s} - 5 \\, \\text{m/s} = 6 \\, \\text{m/s}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, a whirligig spins at 6 meters per second.",
    "answer": "A thingamabob spins 1/11 as fast as a whatchamacallit, so it spins at 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.\nA whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob, so it spins at 11 * 5 = <<11*5=55>>55 meters per second.\n#### 55"
