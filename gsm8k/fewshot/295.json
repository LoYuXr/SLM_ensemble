    "question": "Darren decides to do body exercises for a whole week. He does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses on the first day. On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than on the first day, ten fewer squats, and doubles the number of dumbbell presses. What's the total count of the activities he's done in the two days?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of body exercises Darren does over the two days, we need to calculate the number of each type of exercise he does on each day and then sum them up.\n\n**First Day:**\n- Pushups: 100\n- Squats: 50\n- Dumbbell presses: 20\n\n**Second Day:**\n- Pushups: 100 (from the first day) + 20 = 120\n- Squats: 50 (from the first day) - 10 = 40\n- Dumbbell presses: 20 (from the first day) * 2 = 40\n\nNow, we sum up the exercises from both days:\n\n- Pushups: 100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220\n- Squats: 50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90\n- Dumbbell presses: 20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60\n\nFinally, we sum these totals to get the total number of exercises done over the two days:\n\n\\[ 220 + 90 + 60 = 370 \\]\n\nSo, the total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days is \\(\\boxed{370}\\).",
    "answer": "The total count of activities for the first day is 100+50+20 = <<100+50+20=170>>170\nOn the second day, he does 100+20 = <<100+20=120>>120 pushups\nHe also does 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 squats on the second day\nFor the dumbbell presses, he doubles the number of the first day, which becomes 2*20 = <<2*20=40>>40\nThe total count for the three activities on the second day is 40+40+120 = <<40+40+120=200>>200\nFor the two days, his total count for all the three activities is 200+170 = <<200+170=370>>370\n#### 370"
