    "question": "John wins an award at work.  The award has a 1 time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise in salary.  If he makes 2000 a week, every week of the year and he got the award on the first day of the year how much money did he make that year?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money John made that year, we need to consider both the monetary reward and the salary raise he received. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the monetary reward:**\n   John received a 1-time monetary reward of $5000.\n\n2. **Calculate the salary raise:**\n   The raise is 5% of his weekly salary. His weekly salary is $2000. Therefore, the raise is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Raise} = 2000 \\times \\frac{5}{100} = 2000 \\times 0.05 = 100\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total earnings:**\n   The total earnings are the sum of the monetary reward and the salary raise:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Earnings} = \\text{Monetary Reward} + \\text{Salary Raise} = 5000 + 100 = 5100\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total earnings for the year:**\n   Since John gets the award on the first day of the year, we need to consider the earnings for the first week of the year. Assuming the award is given on the first day of the year, we need to calculate the earnings for the first week and then multiply by 52 weeks in a year.\n\n   The earnings for the first week are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{First Week Earnings} = 5000\n   \\]\n\n   The earnings for the remaining 51 weeks of the year are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings for 51 Weeks} = 51 \\times 2000 = 102000\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the total earnings for the year are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Earnings for the Year} = \\text{First Week Earnings} + \\text{Earnings for 51 Weeks} = 5000 + 102000 = 107000\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total amount of money John made that year is \\(\\boxed{107000}\\).",
    "answer": "He makes 2000*52=$<<2000*52=104000>>104,000 a year\nSo the raise is worth .05*104,000=$<<.05*104000=5200>>5200\nSo he makes 104,000+5200=$<<104000+5200=109200>>109,200 from his salary\nSo in total he made 109,200+5,000=$<<109200+5000=114200>>114,200\n#### 114,200"
