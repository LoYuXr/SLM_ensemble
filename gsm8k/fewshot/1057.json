    "question": "Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday and half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday. If they watch movies every weekend, how many movies can they watch in 4 weeks?",
    "completion": "To determine how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of movies watched on Sunday.\n2. Calculate the total number of movies watched in one week.\n3. Calculate the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks.\n\nFirst, we know that Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday. Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\text{ movies} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of movies watched in one week. Since they watch 4 movies on Saturday and 2 movies on Sunday, the total number of movies watched in one week is:\n\\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \\text{ movies} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks. Since they watch 6 movies each week, the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\text{ movies} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]",
    "answer": "They watch 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 movies every Sunday.\nThey watch a total of 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 movies every weekend.\nTherefore, they can watch 6 x 4 = <<6*4=24>>24 movies in four weeks.\n#### 24"
