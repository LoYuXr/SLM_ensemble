    "question": "To be promoted to the next school year, Jane takes 3 tests that together must total at least 42 points. On her first test, Jane scored 15 points, on the second test she scored 18 points. What is the minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass?",
    "completion": "To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test to pass, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total points needed to pass the school year:**\n   - The school year requires a total of at least 42 points.\n   - Jane has already taken 3 tests, and each test is worth 10 points.\n   - Therefore, the total points from the first 3 tests are:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ points}\n     \\]\n   - To pass, Jane needs at least:\n     \\[\n     42 - 30 = 12 \\text{ points}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the minimum score needed on the third test:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the score Jane needs on the third test.\n   - The total points from the first two tests are:\n     \\[\n     15 + 18 = 33 \\text{ points}\n     \\]\n   - To find the minimum score \\( x \\) on the third test, we need to ensure that the total score from all three tests is at least 12 points:\n     \\[\n     33 + x \\geq 12\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x \\geq 12 - 33\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x \\geq -21\n     \\]\n   - Since a score cannot be negative, we need to adjust our approach. Instead, we should find the minimum score \\( x \\) such that:\n     \\[\n     33 + x \\geq 12\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x \\geq 12 - 33\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x \\geq -21\n     \\]\n   - This indicates that the minimum score \\( x \\) must be at least 12 points, because the total score from the first two tests is 33 points, which is more than the required 12 points to pass.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test to pass is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Adding the points obtained in the first two tests, Jane scored 15 + 18 = <<15+18=33>>33 points.\nTo pass, Jane must score 42 - 33 = <<42-33=9>>9 points.\n#### 9"
