    "question": "James decides to pick some blueberries.  It cost $20 to go picking and then another $1.5 per pound.  He picked 30 pounds of blueberries.  How much did he save compared to buying at the store for $2.5 a pound?",
    "completion": "To determine how much James saved by picking his blueberries at the farmer's market instead of buying them at the store, we need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries at the farmer's market and compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries at the farmer's market:\n- The cost to go picking is $20.\n- The cost per pound is $1.5.\n- James picked 30 pounds of blueberries.\n\nThe total cost at the farmer's market is:\n\\[\n20 + (30 \\times 1.5) = 20 + 45 = 65 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store:\n- The cost per pound is $2.5.\n- James picked 30 pounds of blueberries.\n\nThe total cost at the store is:\n\\[\n30 \\times 2.5 = 75 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the total cost at the farmer's market and the total cost at the store:\n\\[\n65 - 75 = -10 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSince the result is negative, it means James saved $10 compared to buying the blueberries at the store.\n\nTherefore, the amount James saved is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",
    "answer": "He paid 30*1.5=$<<30*1.5=45>>45 for the blueberries he picked\nSo after the entrance fee it was 45+20=$<<45+20=65>>65\nTo buy them at the grocery store it would cost 30*2.5=$<<30*2.5=75>>75\nSo he saved 75-65=$<<75-65=10>>10\n#### 10"
