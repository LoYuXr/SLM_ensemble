    "question": "Patrick has three glue sticks that are partially used. One has 1/6 left, the second has 2/3 left and the third one has 1/2 left. If a glue stick is 12 millimeters long originally, what is the total length of the glue sticks that are not used?",
    "completion": "To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the length of each glue stick that is not used.\n2. Sum the lengths of the unused glue sticks.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of each unused glue stick. The original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters.\n\nThe first glue stick has 1/6 of its original length left:\n\\[\n\\text{Length of the first unused glue stick} = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 12 = 2 \\text{ millimeters}\n\\]\n\nThe second glue stick has 2/3 of its original length left:\n\\[\n\\text{Length of the second unused glue stick} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 12 = 8 \\text{ millimeters}\n\\]\n\nThe third glue stick has 1/2 of its original length left:\n\\[\n\\text{Length of the third unused glue stick} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\text{ millimeters}\n\\]\n\nNext, we sum the lengths of the unused glue sticks:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length of the unused glue sticks} = 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \\text{ millimeters}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is \\boxed{16} millimeters.",
    "answer": "The first glue stick has 12 x 1/6 = <<12*1/6=2>>2 millimeters left.\nThe second glue stick has 12 x 2/3 = <<12*2/3=8>>8 millimeters left.\nThe third glue stick has 12 x 1/2 = <<12*1/2=6>>6 millimeters left.\nThere are a total of 2 + 8 + 6 = <<2+8+6=16>>16 millimeters of glue sticks that are not used.\n#### 16"
