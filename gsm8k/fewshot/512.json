    "question": "Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. If her gym teacher tells her to run 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, how many milliliters of water will Hannah need to drink?",
    "completion": "To determine how many milliliters of water Hannah will need to drink, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance Hannah runs.\n2. Determine the amount of water she needs based on the distance she runs.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total distance Hannah runs. She runs 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km. So, the total distance is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ laps} \\times 0.25 \\text{ km/lap} = 2 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much water she needs. Since she needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer, the total amount of water she needs is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ km} \\times 60 \\text{ ml/km} = 120 \\text{ ml} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of water Hannah will need to drink is:\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]",
    "answer": "First find the total number of kilometers Hannah runs: 8 laps * .25 km/lap = <<8*.25=2>>2 km\nThen multiply the number of kilometers she runs by the amount of water she needs per kilometer to find the total amount of water she needs: 60 ml/km * 2 km = <<60*2=120>>120 ml\n#### 120"
