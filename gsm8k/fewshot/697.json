    "question": "Great Grandma Jones has three children.  And each of her children has three children of their own, who are Great Grandma Jones' grandchildren.  And each of these grandchildren has three babies of their own, who are Great Grandma Jones' great grand-babies.  If all of the family show up at the family reunion, how many great grand-babies will be there for Great Grandma Jones to kiss?",
    "completion": "To determine how many great-grandbabies will be at the family reunion, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of great-grandbabies step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Family:**\n   - Great Grandma Jones has three children.\n   - Each of these children has three children.\n   - Each of these grandchildren has three children.\n   - Each of these grandchildren has three great-grandbabies.\n\n2. **Calculating the number of great-grandbabies:**\n   - Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.\n   - Each of these children has 3 grandchildren.\n   - Each of these grandchildren has 3 great-grandbabies.\n\n   Therefore, the total number of great-grandbabies is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ (children)} \\times 3 \\text{ (grandchildren per child)} \\times 3 \\text{ (great-grandbabies per grandchild)} = 27\n   \\]\n\nSo, there will be \\(\\boxed{27}\\) great-grandbabies at the family reunion.",
    "answer": "Three children each have three children, for a total of 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 grandchildren.\n9 grandchildren each have 3 babies, for a total of 9*3=<<9*3=27>>27 great grand-babies\n#### 27"
