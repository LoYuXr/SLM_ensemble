    "question": "A factory used to make tractors, but now makes silos. When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. Now, they sell 5 silos a day, and make $220 per silo. What percentage more are they making per day now?",
    "completion": "To determine the percentage increase in the factory's profit per day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the daily profit from selling tractors.\n2. Calculate the daily profit from selling silos.\n3. Determine the difference in profit per day between selling tractors and selling silos.\n4. Calculate the percentage increase in profit per day.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the daily profit from selling tractors.**\n\nThe factory sells 10 tractors per day and makes $100 per tractor. Therefore, the daily profit from selling tractors is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ tractors/day} \\times \\$100/\\text{tractor/day} = \\$1000/\\text{tractor/day} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the daily profit from selling silos.**\n\nThe factory sells 5 silos per day and makes $220 per silo. Therefore, the daily profit from selling silos is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ silos/day} \\times \\$220/\\text{silo/day} = \\$1100/\\text{silo/day} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the difference in profit per day between selling tractors and selling silos.**\n\nThe difference in profit per day is:\n\\[ \\$1100/\\text{silo/day} - \\$1000/\\text{tractor/day} = \\$100/\\text{tractor/day} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase in profit per day.**\n\nThe percentage increase in profit per day is given by the formula:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{\\text{Difference in profit per day}}{\\text{Daily profit from selling tractors}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{\\$100/\\text{tractor/day}}{\\$1000/\\text{tractor/day}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{100}{1000} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.1 \\times 100 = 10\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the factory is making \\(\\boxed{10\\%}\\) more per day now.",
    "answer": "They used to make $1,000 a day because 10 x 100 = <<10*100=1000>>1,000\nThey now make 1,100 a day because 5 x 220 = <<5*220=1100>>1,100\nThey make 10% more per day because 1000 +(1000 x (X/100)) = 1,100 if X = 10\n#### 10"
