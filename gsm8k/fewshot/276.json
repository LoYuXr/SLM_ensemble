    "question": "Carly had 80 cards, 2/5 of the cards had the letter A on them, 1/2 of the remaining had the letter B, 5/8 of the rest had the letter C on them, and the others had the letter D. How many of the cards had the letter D on them?",
    "completion": "To determine how many of Carly's cards had the letter D, we need to follow the given conditions step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of cards with the letter A:**\n   Carly had 80 cards in total.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cards with the letter A} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 80 = \\frac{160}{5} = 32\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of remaining cards after removing the cards with the letter A:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of cards with the letter B:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cards with the letter B} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 48 = 24\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of remaining cards after removing the cards with the letter B:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of cards with the letter C:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cards with the letter C} = \\frac{5}{8} \\times 24 = \\frac{120}{8} = 15\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the number of cards with the letter D:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cards with the letter D} = 24 - 15 = 9\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
    "answer": "The number of cards with the letter A on them is 2/5*80 = <<2/5*80=32>>32 cards.\nThere were 80-32 = <<80-32=48>>48 cards with no letter on them.\nHalf of the remaining cards had the letter B on them, a total of 1/2*48 = 24 cards.\nOut of the remaining cards, the number that did not have the letter B on them is 48-24 = <<48-24=24>>24\nIf 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them, there were 5/8*24 = <<5/8*24=15>>15 cards with the letter C on them.\nThe number of cards that had the letter D on them is 24-15 = <<24-15=9>>9\n#### 9"
