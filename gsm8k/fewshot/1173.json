    "question": "A regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12. There's currently a special size box for the same price that has 20% more pods. How many dishwashing cycles with the new box can you run for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle?",
    "completion": "To determine how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box of 100 dishwasher pods for $1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of pods in the new box:**\n   The new box has 20% more pods than the original box. The original box has 100 pods.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of pods in the new box} = 100 + 0.20 \\times 100 = 100 + 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the cost per cycle:**\n   The cost per cycle is $12.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of cycles you can run with the new box:**\n   To find out how many cycles you can run with $1, we divide the total amount of money you have by the cost per cycle.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cycles} = \\frac{1}{120} = \\frac{1}{120} \\times 100 = \\frac{100}{120} = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.8333\n   \\]\n   Since you can only run whole cycles, you can run 0 cycles with the new box.\n\nTherefore, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",
    "answer": "If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods\nIf the new one has 20 more pods than the regular one, the new box has a total of 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 pods\nIf the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12\nIf the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10\nIf 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10\nIf 1 cycle costs $0.10, then for $1 I could run $1/$0.1 = 10 cycles\n#### 10"
