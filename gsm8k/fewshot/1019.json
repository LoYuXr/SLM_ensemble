    "question": "On a busy Saturday morning, a hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.  24 guests elected an early checkout and 15 elected for a late checkout.  In the afternoon twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.  7 more people checked in after dinner was served.  How many guests does the hotel now have?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of guests at the hotel, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial number of guests**: 100 guests.\n2. **Guests who elected an early checkout**: 24 guests.\n3. **Guests who elected a late checkout**: 15 guests.\n4. **Guests who checked in after dinner**: Twice as many as those who opted for a late checkout.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 15 = 30 \\text{ guests}\n   \\]\n5. **Guests who checked in after dinner**: 7 more than those who checked in after dinner.\n   \\[\n   30 + 7 = 37 \\text{ guests}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum up all the guests:\n\n\\[\n100 \\text{ (initial guests)} + 24 \\text{ (early checkout guests)} + 15 \\text{ (late checkout guests)} + 30 \\text{ (after dinner guests)} + 37 \\text{ (after dinner guests)} = 206 \\text{ guests}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of guests at the hotel is \\(\\boxed{206}\\).",
    "answer": "24 guests checked out early and 15 checked out late so 24+15 = <<24+15=39>>39 guests checked out\nThe hotel was completely booked with 100 guests and 39 of those guest checked out so now there are 100-39 = <<100-39=61>>61 guests\nTwice as many checked in that afternoon than the 15 who opted for a late check out so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 guests checked in that afternoon\nThe hotel was down to 61 guests and 30 checked in that afternoon and an additional 7 checked in after dinner for a total of 61+30+7 = <<61+30+7=98>>98 guests\n#### 98"
