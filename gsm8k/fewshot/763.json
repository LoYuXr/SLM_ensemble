    "question": "Rob, Royce, and Pedro are contractors getting ready to put a new roof on three homes. If the three homes will need 250 cases of shingles, with the first house needing 1/2 of the second, and the third needing double the first. How many cases of shingles will the third house need?",
    "completion": "To determine how many cases of shingles the third house will need, we start by defining the number of cases required for each house based on the given information.\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the number of cases of shingles required for the first house.\n2. According to the problem, the first house needs \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the second house. Therefore, the second house needs \\( 2x \\) cases of shingles.\n3. The third house needs double the number of cases of shingles as the first house. Therefore, the third house needs \\( 2x \\) cases of shingles.\n\nThe total number of cases required for all three houses is given as 250. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:\n\n\\[\nx + 2x + 2x = 250\n\\]\n\nCombine the terms on the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n5x = 250\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{250}{5} = 50\n\\]\n\nNow that we know \\( x = 50 \\), we can determine the number of cases required for the third house:\n\n\\[\n2x = 2 \\times 50 = 100\n\\]\n\nThus, the third house will need \\(\\boxed{100}\\) cases of shingles.",
    "answer": "Let x be the number of cases of shingles for the second house\nThe first house needs 1/2 x cases of shingles\nThe third house needs 2(1/2)x=x cases of shingles\n250=x+x+(1/2)x\n250=(5/2)x\n250(2/5)=100=x\nThe third house needs 100 cases of shingles\n#### 100"
