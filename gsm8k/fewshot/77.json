    "question": "If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.",
    "completion": "To determine the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the amount of laundry Sarah does.\n2. Use the information about Sarah's laundry to find the amount of laundry Raymond does.\n3. Calculate the difference between the amounts of laundry Raymond and David do.\n\nFirst, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can find out how much laundry David does by dividing the amount of laundry Sarah does by 4:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Amount of laundry David does} = \\frac{\\text{Amount of laundry Sarah does}}{4} = \\frac{400}{4} = 100 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can find out how much laundry Raymond does by dividing the amount of laundry Sarah does by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Amount of laundry Raymond does} = \\frac{\\text{Amount of laundry Sarah does}}{2} = \\frac{400}{2} = 200 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Amount of laundry Raymond does} - \\text{Amount of laundry David does} = 200 - 100 = 100 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nThus, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \\boxed{100} pounds.",
    "answer": "If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does 1/2*400 = 200 pounds of laundry.\nSara also does 4 times as much laundry as David, meaning David does 400/4 = <<400/4=100>>100 pounds of laundry.\nThe difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200-100 = <<200-100=100>>100 pounds\n#### 100"
