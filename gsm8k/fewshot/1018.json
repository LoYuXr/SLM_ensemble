    "question": "It takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages of his book before he goes to bed. He reads 18 pages of his book and then decides to go to sleep. How long does James spend reading, in minutes?",
    "completion": "To determine how long James spends reading, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the reading speed in pages per minute:**\n   James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. Therefore, his reading speed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Reading speed} = \\frac{3 \\text{ pages}}{10 \\text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \\text{ pages per minute}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of pages James reads:**\n   James reads 18 pages in total.\n\n3. **Calculate the time spent reading:**\n   To find out how long it takes to read 18 pages at a reading speed of 0.3 pages per minute, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Total pages}}{\\text{Reading speed}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{18 \\text{ pages}}{0.3 \\text{ pages per minute}} = 60 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total time James spends reading is \\(\\boxed{60}\\) minutes.",
    "answer": "James would take 18 \u00f7 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 times longer if he read all 18 pages.\nThis means James would spend 6 \u00d7 10 = <<6*10=60>>60 minutes reading.\n#### 60"
