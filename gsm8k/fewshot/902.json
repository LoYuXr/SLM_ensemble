    "question": "The educational shop is selling notebooks for $1.50 each and a ballpen at $0.5 each.  William bought five notebooks and a ballpen. How much did he spend in all?",
    "completion": "To determine how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks:\n- William bought 5 notebooks.\n- Each notebook costs $1.50.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the notebooks is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\text{ notebooks} \\times \\$1.50 \\text{ per notebook} = \\$7.50\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the ballpen:\n- William bought 1 ballpen.\n- Each ballpen costs $0.50.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the ballpen is:\n  \\[\n  1 \\text{ ballpen} \\times \\$0.50 \\text{ per ballpen} = \\$0.50\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the costs of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:\n\\[\n\\$7.50 \\text{ (notebooks)} + \\$0.50 \\text{ (ballpen)} = \\$8.00\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount William spent is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
    "answer": "The cost of the six notebooks was 5 x $1.50 = $7.5.\nTherefore, William spent a total of $7.50 + $0.50 = $<<7.5+0.5=8>>8 in all.\n#### 8"
