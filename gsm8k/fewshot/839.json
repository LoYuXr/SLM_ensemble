    "question": "A farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from a cow. Since he has 3 cows, how many more cows does he need to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of milk produced by the current 3 cows in a day.\n2. Determine how much more milk is needed to reach 25 liters.\n3. Calculate how many more cows are needed to produce the additional milk.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of milk produced by the current 3 cows in a day:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ cows} \\times 5 \\text{ liters/cow} = 15 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much more milk is needed to reach 25 liters:\n\\[ 25 \\text{ liters} - 15 \\text{ liters} = 10 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nSince each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we can determine how many more cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk:\n\\[ \\frac{10 \\text{ liters}}{5 \\text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \\text{ cows} \\]\n\nTherefore, the farmer needs \\(\\boxed{2}\\) more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.",
    "answer": "He extracts 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 liters of milk in a day.\nHe should extract 25-15=<<25-15=10>>10 liters more in a day.\nFor that, he needs 10/5=<<10/5=2>>2 more cows.\n#### 2"
