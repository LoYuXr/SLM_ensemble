    "question": "While working at the restaurant, each of the forty customers who came into the restaurant gave Rafaela a $20 tip. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. How much money did Julieta and Rafaela receive as tips altogether?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the amount of money Rafaela received as a tip.\n2. Calculate the amount of money Julieta received as a tip.\n3. Add the amounts of money received by Rafaela and Julieta to find the total.\n\nFirst, we know that each of the forty customers gave Rafaela a $20 tip. Therefore, Rafaela received:\n\\[ 40 \\times 20 = 800 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we are told that Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. This means Julieta received 90% of the amount Rafaela received. Therefore, the amount of money Julieta received as a tip is:\n\\[ 800 \\times 0.90 = 720 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add the amounts of money received by Rafaela and Julieta to find the total:\n\\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1520} \\]",
    "answer": "The total amount of money that Rafaela received as tips from the forty customers is 40*$20 = $<<40*20=800>>800\nJulieta got 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, a total of 10/100*$800 = $<<10/100*800=80>>80\nThe total amount of money that Julieta received as tips is $800-$80 = $<<800-80=720>>720\nAltogether, Julieta, and Rafaela received $720+$800 = $<<720+800=1520>>1520\n#### 1520"
