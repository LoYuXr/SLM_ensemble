    "question": "John has 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each.  Each bedroom has 2 windows each.  There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.  How many total windows are there between the houses?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of windows between John's houses, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of windows in each house:**\n   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.\n   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.\n   - Therefore, each house has \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) windows.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of windows in the additional bedrooms:**\n   - Each house has 3 bedrooms, and there are 4 additional bedrooms.\n   - Each additional bedroom has 2 windows.\n   - Therefore, the additional bedrooms contribute \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) windows.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of windows in the houses:**\n   - Each house has 6 windows.\n   - There are 2 houses.\n   - Therefore, the total number of windows in the houses is \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of windows between the houses:**\n   - The total number of windows is the sum of the windows in the houses and the additional windows.\n   - Therefore, the total number of windows is \\(12 + 8 = 20\\).\n\nThus, the total number of windows between the houses is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
    "answer": "Each house has 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 windows for the bedrooms\nSo each house has 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10 windows\nSo the total number of windows is 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 windows\n#### 20"
