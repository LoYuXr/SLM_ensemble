    "question": "There are 30 students in Marissa\u2019s class. Each student started the year with 10 pencils. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils in class were used. At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. How many pencils were left?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pencils were left in Marissa's class at the end of the year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pencils used after two months.\n2. Determine the number of pencils remaining after the pencils were used.\n3. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pencils used after two months.**\n\nInitially, each of the 30 students had 10 pencils. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. Therefore, the number of pencils used is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\times 30 \\times 10 = 60\n\\]\nSo, 60 pencils were used in total.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of pencils remaining after the pencils were used.**\n\nInitially, there were 30 pencils. After using 60 pencils, the number of pencils remaining is:\n\\[\n30 - 60 = -30\n\\]\nSince it is not possible to have a negative number of pencils, it means that all the pencils were used up, and there are no pencils left. However, if we interpret the problem as the pencils being used up and the remaining pencils being calculated based on the given conditions, we can proceed with the remaining pencils.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year.**\n\nAt the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. Since all the pencils were used up, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 0 = 0\n\\]\nSo, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",
    "answer": "There were 30 x 10 = <<30*10=300>>300 pencils in the class at the start of the year.\nAfter two months, 300 x 1/5 = <<300*1/5=60>>60 pencils were used.\nThus, 300 - 60 = <<300-60=240>>240 pencils were left unused after two months.\nTherefore, 240 x 1/3 = <<240*1/3=80>>80 pencils were left at the end of the year.\n#### 80"
