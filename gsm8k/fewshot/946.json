    "question": "A bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. If Sam had seventy loaves of bread last Friday, how many loaves of bread does the bakery have?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we start by defining the number of loaves of bread Sam had last Friday as \\( S \\). According to the problem, Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, so we can write:\n\n\\[ S = 70 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has. The problem states that the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. Therefore, we can express the number of loaves of bread the bakery has as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of loaves of bread} = 7S - 40 \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( S \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of loaves of bread} = 7 \\times 70 - 40 \\]\n\nNow, we perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[ 7 \\times 70 = 490 \\]\n\nThen, we subtract 40 from 490:\n\n\\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of loaves of bread the bakery has is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{450} \\]",
    "answer": "If Sam had seventy loaves of bread last Friday, seven times that number is 7*70 = 490 loaves.\nSince the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday, the bakery has 490-40 = 450 loaves of bread\n#### 450"
