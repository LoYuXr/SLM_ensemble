    "question": "Bob needs to buy potting soil to fill the raised beds in his vegetable garden. He has 10 raised beds, and each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil and costs $12. How much will the potting soil cost him?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost of the potting soil that Bob needs to buy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the volume of soil needed for one raised bed.\n2. Determine how many bags of soil are required.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the soil.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the volume of soil needed for one raised bed. The volume \\( V \\) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of a raised bed) is given by the formula:\n\\[ V = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nFor one raised bed:\n\\[ V = 8 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 2 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 2 \\, \\text{feet} = 32 \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many bags of soil are required. Since each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, we divide the total volume of soil needed by the volume of one bag:\n\\[ \\text{Number of bags} = \\frac{32 \\, \\text{cubic feet}}{2 \\, \\text{cubic feet per bag}} = 16 \\, \\text{bags} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of the soil. Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 16 \\, \\text{bags} \\times 12 \\, \\text{dollars per bag} = 192 \\, \\text{dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost for the potting soil is:\n\\[ \\boxed{192} \\]",
    "answer": "Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.\nHe has 10 beds, so he will need 10 * 32 = <<10*32=320>>320 cubic feet of dirt.\nEach bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.\nEach bag is $12, so all the soil will cost him $12 * 160 = $<<12*160=1920>>1920.\n#### 1920"
