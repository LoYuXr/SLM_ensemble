    "question": "James has 30 teeth. His dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. What percentage of James' teeth does the dentist fix?",
    "completion": "To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of teeth the dentist fixes.\n2. Determine the percentage of teeth the dentist fixes.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many teeth the dentist fixes. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, the number of teeth the dentist fixes is:\n\\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out what percentage 11 teeth is of James' total of 30 teeth. The formula to calculate the percentage is:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\\text{Total number of teeth}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{11}{30} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nNow, we perform the division and multiplication:\n\\[ \\frac{11}{30} = 0.366667 \\]\n\\[ 0.366667 \\times 100 = 36.6667 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get:\n\\[ 36.67\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{36.67} \\]",
    "answer": "First find the total number of teeth the dentist caps: 4 teeth + 7 teeth = <<4+7=11>>11 teeth\nThen find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes: 11 teeth + 4 teeth = <<11+4=15>>15 teeth\nThen divide that number by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of teeth he fixes: 15 teeth / 30 teeth * 100% = 50%\n#### 50"
