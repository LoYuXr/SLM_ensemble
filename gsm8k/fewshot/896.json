    "question": "John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time.  He gets paid $25 an hour.  If his car payment is $500, how much profit does he make on his car?",
    "completion": "To determine John's profit from renting his car, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hours John rents his car in a month.\n2. Determine the total earnings from renting the car.\n3. Subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car in a month. John rents his car 10 times a month, and each time he rents it for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours he rents the car in a month is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ times/month} \\times 3 \\text{ hours/time} = 30 \\text{ hours/month} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total earnings from renting the car. John gets paid $25 per hour, so the total earnings for 30 hours is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ hours} \\times 25 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nJohn's car payment is $500. To find the profit, we subtract the car payment from the total earnings:\n\\[ 750 \\text{ dollars} - 500 \\text{ dollars} = 250 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, John's profit from renting his car is:\n\\[ \\boxed{250} \\]",
    "answer": "He rents his car 10*3=<<10*3=30>>30 hour a month\nSo he makes 25*30=$<<25*30=750>>750 a month\nThat means he has a profit of 750-500=$<<750-500=250>>250 a month\n#### 250"
