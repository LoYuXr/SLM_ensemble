    "question": "A restaurant has 40 tables with 4 legs and 50 tables with 3 legs. Calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have.",
    "completion": "To calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to consider the legs contributed by the tables with 4 legs and the tables with 3 legs separately, and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of legs contributed by the 40 tables with 4 legs each:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ tables} \\times 4 \\text{ legs/table} = 160 \\text{ legs} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of legs contributed by the 50 tables with 3 legs each:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ tables} \\times 3 \\text{ legs/table} = 150 \\text{ legs} \\]\n\nNow, we add the two amounts together to get the total number of legs:\n\\[ 160 \\text{ legs} + 150 \\text{ legs} = 310 \\text{ legs} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310.",
    "answer": "The total number of legs which the tables with four legs have is 40*4 = <<40*4=160>>160 legs\nThe three-legged tables have a total of 50*3 = <<50*3=150>>150 legs.\nThe total number of legs that the restaurant's table have is 150+160 = <<150+160=310>>310\n#### 310"
