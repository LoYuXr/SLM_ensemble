    "question": "Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks from his store supplying fertiliser to different farmers in his hometown dispatched for delivery on a particular day. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser packed in bags. Two hours after the trucks had departed for delivery, Mr Hezekiah got the news that a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures on the road and could not deliver the fertilisers to the farmers. Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of lorries dispatched for delivery.\n2. Determine the number of lorries that could not deliver the fertilisers due to mechanical failures.\n3. Calculate the number of lorries that could deliver the fertilisers.\n4. Determine the total number of lorries that delivered the fertilisers.\n5. Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser delivered.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The total number of lorries dispatched for delivery is 20.\n\n2. Two hours after the trucks departed, 20% of the lorries could not deliver the fertilisers. Therefore, 80% of the lorries could deliver the fertilisers. The number of lorries that could deliver the fertilisers is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 0.80 = 16\n   \\]\n\n3. The number of lorries that could deliver the fertilisers is 16. Since each truck carries 20 tons of fertiliser, the total number of tons of fertiliser delivered is:\n   \\[\n   16 \\times 20 = 320\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is \\(\\boxed{320}\\).",
    "answer": "If there were 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and 1/4 of the total number had mechanical failures, there were 1/4*20 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 failed deliveries.\nOut of the 20 trucks dispatched to deliver fertiliser, 20-5 = <<20-5=15>>15 trucks delivered to the farmers.\nSince each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of tons of fertiliser delivered that day was 15*20 = <<15*20=300>>300 tons.\n#### 300"
