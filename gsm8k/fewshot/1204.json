    "question": "Twenty tourists discovered 700 shells in a strip mall parking lot. They had divided into three groups, Alphas, The finders, and Gogetters to find as many shells as possible. If team Alphas found 40% of the shells, and team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, how many shells did team Gogetters find?",
    "completion": "To determine how many shells team Gogetters found, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas.\n2. Determine the number of shells remaining after team Alphas have found their share.\n3. Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders based on the remaining shells.\n4. Determine the number of shells remaining after team The finders have found their share.\n5. Calculate the number of shells found by team Gogetters based on the remaining shells.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The total number of shells is 700. Team Alphas found 40% of the shells.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Shells found by team Alphas} = 0.40 \\times 700 = 280\n   \\]\n\n2. The number of shells remaining after team Alphas have found their share is:\n   \\[\n   700 - 280 = 420\n   \\]\n\n3. Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Shells found by team The finders} = 0.60 \\times 420 = 252\n   \\]\n\n4. The number of shells remaining after team The finders have found their share is:\n   \\[\n   420 - 252 = 168\n   \\]\n\n5. Team Gogetters found the remaining shells. Since the total number of shells is 700 and 168 are left, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Shells found by team Gogetters} = 700 - 168 = 532\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is \\(\\boxed{532}\\).",
    "answer": "Team Alphas found 40/100*700 = <<40/100*700=280>>280 shells.\nIf team Alphas found 280 shells, the other teams found 700-280 = 420 shells.\nTeam The Finders found 60% of the remaining shells, a total of 60/100*420 = <<60/100*420=252>>252 shells.\nIf The finders found 252 shells, team Gogetters found 420-252 = 168 shells.\n#### 168"
