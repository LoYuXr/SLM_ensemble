    "question": "Robert is building a 15 foot long, 10 foot wide, rectangular wooden fence around his garden.  He needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing he builds.  How many wooden slats will he need?",
    "completion": "To determine how many wooden slats Robert will need, we need to calculate the total length of the fence he will build and then find out how many slats are required based on the slat count per foot of fencing.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total length of the fence:\n- The length of the fence is 15 feet.\n- The width of the fence is 10 feet.\n- Therefore, the total length of the fence is \\(15 \\text{ feet} \\times 10 \\text{ feet} = 150 \\text{ feet}\\).\n\nNext, we need to determine how many slats are required. Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we can calculate the total number of slats by multiplying the total length of the fence by 2:\n\\[ 150 \\text{ feet} \\times 2 \\text{ slats per foot} = 300 \\text{ slats} \\]\n\nThus, Robert will need \\(\\boxed{300}\\) wooden slats.",
    "answer": "A rectangle has 2 long sides and Robert wants them to be 15 feet long so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 feet long\nA rectangle has 2 short sides and Robert wants them to be 10 feet wide so 2*10= <<2*10=20>>20 feet wide\nTogether, he will need 30 feet and 20 feet of fencing so 30+20 = <<30+20=50>>50 feet of fencing\nHe needs 2 wooden slats per 1 foot of fencing and he is building 50 feet of fencing so he needs 50*2 = <<2*50=100>>100 wooden slats\n#### 100"
