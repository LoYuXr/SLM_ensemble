    "question": "Hunter counted 50 cars packed in their school parking lot when entering class one morning. During the first break, he counted 20 more cars in the parking lot. When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. What's the total number of cars he counted during lunch break?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of cars Hunter counted in the morning.\n2. Calculate the number of cars that went missing during the lunch break.\n3. Subtract the number of cars that went missing from the morning count to find the number of cars counted during lunch break.\n\nLet's start with the morning count:\n- Hunter counted 50 cars in the morning.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of cars that went missing during the lunch break:\n- 1/2 the number of cars in the morning went missing.\n- Therefore, the number of cars that went missing is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 50 = 25 \\).\n\nNow, we subtract the number of cars that went missing from the morning count to find the number of cars counted during lunch break:\n- The number of cars counted during lunch break is \\( 50 - 25 = 25 \\).\n\nThus, the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
    "answer": "During the first break, he saw 20 more cars in the parking lot, which totals 50 + 20 = <<50+20=70>>70 cars\nWhen going for the lunch break, he counted and realized only half the number of cars were present, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.\n#### 35"
