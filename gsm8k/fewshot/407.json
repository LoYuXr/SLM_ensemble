    "question": "Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school and did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?",
    "completion": "To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of steps Elliott took before his jog:**\n   - Elliott walked to school and back, which is 2 walks.\n   - Each walk is 10,000 steps.\n   - Therefore, the total number of steps before his jog is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 10,000 = 20,000 \\text{ steps}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of steps Elliott took after his jog:**\n   - After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.\n   - Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog is:\n     \\[\n     20,000 - 2,000 = 18,000 \\text{ steps}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Elliott took \\(\\boxed{18000}\\) steps during his jog.",
    "answer": "Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.\nAdding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.\nHe only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps \u2013 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.\nThe difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps \u2013 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.\n#### 2000"
