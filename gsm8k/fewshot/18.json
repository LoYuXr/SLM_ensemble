    "question": "Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?",
    "completion": "To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.\n2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.\n3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.\n4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. Therefore, in one day, she eats 3 eggs.\n2. There are 7 days in a week. So, in one week, she eats \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) eggs.\n3. There are 4 weeks in 4 weeks. So, in 4 weeks, she eats \\(21 \\times 4 = 84\\) eggs.\n4. To find out how many dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since one dozen equals 12 eggs). So, \\(84 \\div 12 = 7\\).\n\nTherefore, Claire will eat \\(\\boxed{7}\\) dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.",
    "answer": "She eats 3 eggs every day and there are 7 days in a week so she eats 3*7 = <<3*7=21>>21 eggs a week\nAfter 4 weeks she will have eaten 4*21 = <<4*21=84>>84 eggs\nThere are 12 eggs in 1 dozen and she'll eat 84 eggs so that's 84/12 = <<84/12=7>>7 dozen eggs\n#### 7"
