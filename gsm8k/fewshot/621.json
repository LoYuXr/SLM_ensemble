    "question": "John injured his back and needs to go to physical therapy.  He went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.  Each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time.  If the sessions cost $125 per hour how much did the physical therapy cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of the physical therapy sessions, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of sessions:**\n   John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks. Each week, he went twice for 2 hours. Therefore, the total number of sessions is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ weeks} \\times 2 \\text{ sessions/week} = 12 \\text{ sessions}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total time spent at the physical therapy sessions:**\n   Each session lasts 2 hours. Therefore, the total time spent at the sessions is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ sessions} \\times 2 \\text{ hours/session} = 24 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the sessions:**\n   Each session costs $125. Therefore, the total cost for 24 hours is:\n   \\[\n   24 \\text{ hours} \\times 125 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 3000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total cost of the physical therapy sessions is \\(\\boxed{3000}\\).",
    "answer": "Each week he did 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 hours of physical therapy\nSo it cost 4*125=$<<4*125=500>>500 per week\nThis means he spent 500*6=$<<500*6=3000>>3000\n#### 3000"
