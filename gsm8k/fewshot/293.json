    "question": "Three friends: Mike, Jim, and Tony decided to play a game. After 3 rounds Mike has 21 points, Jim 3 points less than Mike, and Tony 2 times more than Mike. In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. How many points do all three players have in total after the extra points had been distributed?",
    "completion": "To determine the total points of Mike, Jim, and Tony after the fourth round, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the initial points of each player:**\n   - Mike has 21 points.\n   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \\(21 - 3 = 18\\) points.\n   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \\(2 \\times 21 = 42\\) points.\n\n2. **Calculate the points after the fourth round:**\n   - In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.\n   - Mike's points after the fourth round: \\(21 + 1 = 22\\) points.\n   - Jim's points after the fourth round: \\(18 + 1 = 19\\) points.\n   - Tony's points after the fourth round: \\(42 + 1 = 43\\) points.\n\n3. **Calculate the total points after the fourth round:**\n   - Total points = Mike's points after the fourth round + Jim's points after the fourth round + Tony's points after the fourth round\n   - Total points = \\(22 + 19 + 43 = 84\\) points.\n\nThus, the total points of all three players after the fourth round is \\(\\boxed{84}\\).",
    "answer": "After 3 rounds Jim has 21 points - 3 points = <<21-3=18>>18 points.\nTony has 2 times more points than Mike, so he has 2 * 21 points = <<2*21=42>>42 points.\nIn total they have 42 points + 18 points + 21 points = <<42+18+21=81>>81 points.\nOnly two of them have over 20 points, so in total, all friends have 81 points + 2 points = <<2+81=83>>83 points.\n#### 83"
