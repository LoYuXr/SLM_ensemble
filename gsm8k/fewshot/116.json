    "question": "Katy makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 7:13. If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",
    "completion": "To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we start by understanding the given ratio of sugar to water, which is 7:13. This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio. This can be calculated by adding the parts of sugar and water together:\n\\[ 7 + 13 = 20 \\text{ parts} \\]\n\nNext, we know that the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons. Since the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we can set up a proportion to find out how much sugar corresponds to one part of the ratio. Let \\( x \\) be the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar. Then, the proportion can be written as:\n\\[ \\frac{7}{20} = \\frac{x}{120} \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we can cross-multiply:\n\\[ 7 \\times 120 = 20 \\times x \\]\n\\[ 840 = 20x \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 20:\n\\[ x = \\frac{840}{20} \\]\n\\[ x = 42 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is \\(\\boxed{42}\\).",
    "answer": "The total ratio representing the ingredients she used to make the coffee is 7+13 = <<7+13=20>>20\nSince the fraction representing the number of teaspoons she used is 7/20, she used 7/20*120 = <<7/20*120=42>>42\n#### 42"
