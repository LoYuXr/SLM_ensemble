    "question": "Nate is feeding his livestock hay. Each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. If there are 15 goats and 12 sheep, how many pounds of hay does Nate need?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we need to calculate the amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of hay needed for the goats:\n- Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.\n- There are 15 goats.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \\text{ goats} \\times 5 \\text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of hay needed for the sheep:\n- Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.\n- Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice the amount each goat needs is \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) pounds.\n- Each sheep needs \\(10 - 3 = 7\\) pounds of hay.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \\text{ sheep} \\times 7 \\text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the amounts of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay required:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total hay} = 75 \\text{ pounds} + 84 \\text{ pounds} = 159 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nThus, Nate needs \\(\\boxed{159}\\) pounds of hay.",
    "answer": "First figure out how much hay each sheep needs: 5 pounds * 2 - 3 = <<5*2-3=7>>7 pounds/sheep\nNow figure out how much hay total the sheep need: 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = <<7*12=84>>84 pounds\nNow figure out how much hay total the goats need: 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = <<5*15=75>>75 pounds\nNow add the two amounts of hay to find the total: 84 pounds + 75 pounds = <<84+75=159>>159 pounds\n#### 159"
