    "question": "Last month, Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. If Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, how much did she make from lemonade sales?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the amount Tasha made from mowing Joe's lawn:**\n   - Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade.\n   - She mowed Joe's lawn thrice as many times as she did from selling lemonade.\n   - Therefore, the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 80 = 240 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Identify the amount Tasha made from mowing Alba's lawn:**\n   - Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did from mowing Joe's lawn.\n   - Therefore, the amount she made from mowing Alba's lawn is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 240 = 1200 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount Tasha made from both mowing Joe's and Alba's lawns:**\n   - The total amount she made from both mowing Joe's and Alba's lawns is:\n     \\[\n     240 + 1200 = 1440 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Add the amount she made from selling lemonade to the total amount from mowing lawns:**\n   - Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade.\n   - She made $1440 from mowing lawns.\n   - Therefore, the total amount she made from both lemonade and lawns is:\n     \\[\n     80 + 1440 = 1520 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is \\(\\boxed{1520}\\).",
    "answer": "At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars\nSince the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.\nAdding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars\nSubtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars\nTasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.\n#### 26"
