    "question": "Gloria is shoe shopping when she comes across a pair of boots that fit her shoe budget. However, she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels that together cost five dollars less than the boots. If one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, how many dollars are the boots?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost of the boots, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.\n\nLet:\n- \\( B \\) be the cost of the boots.\n- \\( H \\) be the cost of the high heels.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. The boots cost $33.\n2. The high heels cost twice as much as the boots, so \\( H = 2B \\).\n3. The high heels cost $33, so \\( H = 33 \\).\n\nSince the high heels cost $33, we can substitute this value into the equation for the high heels:\n\\[ H = 33 \\]\n\nNow, we know the cost of the high heels is $33. The problem states that the two pairs of high heels together cost $5 less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ H + H = B + 5 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( H \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 33 + 33 = B + 5 \\]\n\\[ 66 = B + 5 \\]\n\nTo find the cost of the boots, we solve for \\( B \\):\n\\[ B = 66 - 5 \\]\n\\[ B = 61 \\]\n\nThus, the cost of the boots is \\(\\boxed{61}\\).",
    "answer": "The second pair of heels costs 33 * 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.\nThe heels together cost 66 + 33 = $<<66+33=99>>99.\nThe boots cost $5 more than both pairs of heels together, so the boots cost 99 + 5 = $104.\n#### 104"
