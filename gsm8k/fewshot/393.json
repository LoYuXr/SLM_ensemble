    "question": "Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, and 90 minutes editing it. What percentage of her total work time did she spend editing?",
    "completion": "To determine what percentage of Carol's total work time she spent editing, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the time Carol spent recording the song.\n2. Determine the total time Carol spent working on the song.\n3. Calculate the time Carol spent editing the song.\n4. Find the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing.\n\nFirst, we know that Carol spends 4 hours writing the song. Half of this time is spent recording it:\n\\[ \\text{Recording time} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Carol spends 90 minutes editing the song. We need to convert this time into hours to be consistent with the other times:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the total time Carol spent working on the song:\n\\[ \\text{Total time} = \\text{Writing time} + \\text{Recording time} + \\text{Editing time} = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe percentage of the total work time that was spent editing is:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of time spent editing} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Editing time}}{\\text{Total time}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{1.5}{7.5} \\right) \\times 100 = 20\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
    "answer": "First find how long Carol spent writing the song in minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<4*60=240>>240 minutes\nThen find how long she spent recording the song: 240 minutes / 2 = <<240/2=120>>120 minutes\nThen add up all her work time to find the total work time: 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = <<240+120+90=450>>450 \u200bminutes\nThen divide her editing time by her total work time and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 90 minutes / 450 minutes * 100% = 20%\n#### 20"
