    "question": "A landscaping company is delivering flagstones to a customer\u2019s yard. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. If the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip?",
    "completion": "To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones:**\n   Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. Therefore, the total weight for 80 flagstones is:\n   \\[\n   80 \\text{ flagstones} \\times 75 \\text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total capacity of the delivery trucks:**\n   The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of trucks needed:**\n   To find out how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the total capacity of the trucks:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6000 \\text{ pounds}}{2000 \\text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \\text{ trucks}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
    "answer": "The 80 flagstones weight 75 * 80 = <<75*80=6000>>6000 pounds.\nThus, the landscaping company will need 6000 / 2000 = <<6000/2000=3>>3 trucks to transport the flagstones in one trip.\n#### 3"
