    "question": "Dexter has five pigs. Each one eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. If Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, how many pounds of feed is left after a week?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of feed that all the pigs eat in one day.\n2. Calculate the total amount of feed that all the pigs eat in one week.\n3. Subtract the total amount of feed eaten in one week from the initial amount of feed ordered.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of feed that all the pigs eat in one day. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ pounds/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days/day} = 8 \\text{ pounds/day} \\]\n\nSince there are 5 pigs, the total amount of feed that all the pigs eat in one day is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ pounds/pig/day} \\times 5 \\text{ pigs} = 40 \\text{ pounds/day} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of feed that all the pigs eat in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of feed that all the pigs eat in one week is:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ pounds/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 280 \\text{ pounds/week} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount of feed eaten in one week from the initial amount of feed ordered:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ pounds} - 280 \\text{ pounds} = 20 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pounds of feed left after a week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
    "answer": "In a day, one pig consumes 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 pounds of feed.\nIn a day, five pigs consume 8 x 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 pounds.\nIn a week, five pigs consume 40 x 7 = <<40*7=280>>280 pounds.\nSo, there are 300 - 280 = <<300-280=20>>20 pounds of feed left.\n#### 20"
