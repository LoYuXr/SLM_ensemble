    "question": "A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?",
    "completion": "To determine how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the piece of chalk, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of chalk used by the end of the day:**\n   - The teacher used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day.\n   - The chalk was originally 5 inches long.\n   - 45% of 5 inches is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     0.45 \\times 5 = 2.25 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the amount of chalk used each day:**\n   - The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day.\n   - 20% of 5 inches is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     0.20 \\times 5 = 1 \\text{ inch}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle the piece:**\n   - The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk.\n   - He used 1 inch of chalk each day.\n   - The number of days required to use up 2.25 inches of chalk is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2.25 \\text{ inches}}{1 \\text{ inch/day}} = 2.25 \\text{ days}\n     \\]\n\nSince the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he will need to recycle the piece after 2 days.\n\nThus, the teacher has \\(\\boxed{2}\\) days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.",
    "answer": "The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.\nHe is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.\nThe next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.\nThat leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.\nThe day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.\nThat will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.\nSince 1.76 is less than 2 inches, he will recycle this stick in 2 days.\n#### 2"
