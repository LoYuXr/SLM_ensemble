    "question": "Calvin is making soup for his family for dinner. He has a pot with enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. He is an adult and will be eating with his adult wife and their two children. If everyone eats one bowl at a meal, how many times will each child be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup?",
    "completion": "To determine how many times each child will be able to have a bowl of soup, we need to first calculate the total amount of soup Calvin has and then figure out how much soup is left after he and his family consume their portions.\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of soup:**\n   - Calvin has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls.\n   - Since Calvin is an adult and will be eating with his adult wife and their two children, he will consume 4 adult's bowls and 2 child's bowls.\n   - The total amount of soup is \\(4 \\text{ adult's bowls} + 2 \\text{ child's bowls} = 6 \\text{ bowls}\\).\n\n2. **Determine the amount of soup left:**\n   - After consuming 4 adult's bowls and 2 child's bowls, the amount of soup left is \\(6 \\text{ bowls} - 4 \\text{ adult's bowls} - 2 \\text{ child's bowls} = 0 \\text{ bowls}\\).\n\n3. **Calculate how many times each child can have a bowl of soup:**\n   - Since the total amount of soup is 6 bowls and there are 2 children, each child will have \\(6 \\text{ bowls} \\div 2 \\text{ children} = 3 \\text{ bowls per child}\\).\n\nTherefore, each child will be able to have \\(\\boxed{3}\\) bowls of soup.",
    "answer": "Four adult bowls equal eight children\u2019s bowls, so each adult bowl is 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 children\u2019s bowls.\nCalvin and his wife will eat two adult bowls, so they will eat the equivalent of 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 children\u2019s bowls.\nThus, he, his wife, and their children will eat 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 children\u2019s bowls at dinner.\nAfter dinner, there will be 8 - 6 = <<8-6=2>>2 children\u2019s bowls left over.\nThere are 2 children, so each child will be able to eat a bowl of leftover soup for lunch 2 / 2 = <<2/2=1>>1 time.\n#### 1"
