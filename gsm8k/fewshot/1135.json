    "question": "3 trees each had 7 blue birds in them. 2 different trees each had 4 blue birds. 1 final tree had 3 blue birds. How many blue birds were in the trees in total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of blue birds in all the trees, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each type of tree and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Trees with 7 blue birds each:**\n   - There are 3 trees with 7 blue birds each.\n   - The total number of blue birds in these trees is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 7 = 21\n     \\]\n\n2. **Trees with 4 blue birds each:**\n   - There are 2 trees with 4 blue birds each.\n   - The total number of blue birds in these trees is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 4 = 8\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final tree with 3 blue birds:**\n   - There is 1 tree with 3 blue birds.\n   - The total number of blue birds in this tree is:\n     \\[\n     3\n     \\]\n\nNow, we sum the blue birds from all the trees:\n\\[\n21 + 8 + 3 = 32\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of blue birds in all the trees is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
    "answer": "The first 3 trees had 7*3=<<7*3=21>>21 blue birds.\nThe second 2 trees had 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 blue birds.\nThere were 21+8+3=<<21+8+3=32>>32 blue birds in total.\n#### 32"
