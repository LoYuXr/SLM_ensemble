    "question": "Jason was told he could earn $3.00 for doing his laundry,  $1.50 for cleaning his room, $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb each week and $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher.  In a two week period, Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, did his laundry once, took the trash out twice and cleaned his room once.  How much money did Jason earn?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Jason earned in a two-week period, we need to calculate his earnings from each activity and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Jason's earnings from each activity:\n\n1. **Laundry earnings:**\n   - Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry each week.\n   - He did his laundry once in a two-week period.\n   - Total laundry earnings: \\( 3.00 \\times 2 = 6.00 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Cleaning his room earnings:**\n   - Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room each week.\n   - He cleaned his room once in a two-week period.\n   - Total cleaning room earnings: \\( 1.50 \\times 2 = 3.00 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Taking the trash to the curb earnings:**\n   - Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb each week.\n   - He took the trash to the curb twice in a two-week period.\n   - Total trash earnings: \\( 0.75 \\times 2 = 1.50 \\) dollars.\n\n4. **Emptying the dishwasher earnings:**\n   - Jason earns $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher each week.\n   - He emptied the dishwasher 6 times in a two-week period.\n   - Total dishwasher earnings: \\( 0.50 \\times 6 = 3.00 \\) dollars.\n\nNow, let's sum up all his earnings:\n\n\\[\n6.00 \\text{ (laundry)} + 3.00 \\text{ (cleaning room)} + 1.50 \\text{ (taking the trash)} + 3.00 \\text{ (emptying the dishwasher)} = 13.50 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jason earned a total of \\(\\boxed{13.50}\\) dollars in a two-week period.",
    "answer": "Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times at $0.50 each so he made 6*.50=$<<6*.50=3.00>>3.00\nJason did his laundry 1 time at $3.00 so he made 1*3 = $<<1*3=3.00>>3.00\nJason took the trash out 2 times at $0.75 each so he made 2*.75 = $<<2*.75=1.50>>1.50\nJason cleaned his room 1 time at $1.50 each so he made 1*1.50 = $<<1*1.50=1.50>>1.50\nJason made 3+1.50+1.50+3 = $<<3+1.5+1.5+3=9.00>>9.00\n#### 9"
