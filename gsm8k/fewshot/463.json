    "question": "Ashley's pizza delivery costs $15. What is the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man if she wants to give a tip that is equal to 1/5 of the amount she ordered?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man as a tip, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of the pizza.\n2. Calculate 1/5 of the pizza cost.\n3. Add the tip amount to the cost of the pizza.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The cost of the pizza is $15.\n2. To find 1/5 of $15, we perform the following calculation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5} \\times 15 = 3\n   \\]\n   So, the tip amount is $3.\n3. To find the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man, we add the tip amount to the cost of the pizza:\n   \\[\n   15 + 3 = 18\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
    "answer": "The tip that Ashley wants to give amounts to $15 x 1/5 = $<<15*1/5=3>>3.\nHence, she will give a total of $15 + $3 = $<<15+3=18>>18 to the delivery man.\n#### 18"
