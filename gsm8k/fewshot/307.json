    "question": "Sandy wants to lose as much weight as Joey does but needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. If Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, how many weeks will it take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight?",
    "completion": "To determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Joey's weekly weight loss:**\n   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, his weekly weight loss is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly weight loss} = \\frac{8 \\text{ pounds}}{4 \\text{ weeks}} = 2 \\text{ pounds per week}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Sandy's weekly weight loss:**\n   Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. Therefore, her weekly weight loss is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly weight loss for Sandy} = 2 \\text{ pounds per week}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total weight Sandy needs to lose:**\n   Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, which is 8 pounds. Therefore, the total weight Sandy needs to lose is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight Sandy needs to lose} = 8 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of weeks Sandy needs to lose the total weight:**\n   Since Sandy's weekly weight loss is 2 pounds, the number of weeks it will take her to lose 8 pounds is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of weeks} = \\frac{8 \\text{ pounds}}{2 \\text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\nThus, it will take Sandy \\boxed{4} weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.",
    "answer": "Joey loses 8 pounds / 4 weeks = <<8/4=2>>2 pounds per week.\nIn order to match Joey, Sandy should lose 2 pounds / 4 = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 of a pound per week.\nTo find the number of weeks it will take, divide the number of pounds by the rate of weight loss: 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds/week = <<8/0.5=16>>16 weeks\n#### 16"
