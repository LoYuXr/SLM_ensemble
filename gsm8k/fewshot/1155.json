    "question": "John buys a cassette with 2 songs.  The first song is 5 minutes and the second song is 60% longer.  How much time was the total cassette?",
    "completion": "To determine the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the duration of each song and then sum them up.\n\n1. The first song is 5 minutes long.\n2. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the duration of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.\n\nFirst, calculate 60% of 5 minutes:\n\\[ 60\\% \\text{ of } 5 \\text{ minutes} = 0.60 \\times 5 = 3 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, add this duration to the original 5 minutes to find the total time of the second song:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ minutes} + 3 \\text{ minutes} = 8 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, add the durations of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ minutes} + 8 \\text{ minutes} = 13 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time of the cassette is \\(\\boxed{13}\\) minutes.",
    "answer": "The second song is 5*.6=<<5*.6=3>>3 minutes longer than the first\nSo the second song was 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 minutes\nThat means the total time was 5+8=<<5+8=13>>13 minutes\n#### 13"
