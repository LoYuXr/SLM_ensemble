    "question": "Dijana and Anis live near a lake, and every weekend they go out rowing into the lake. On a Sunday morning, both went out rowing, and Dijana rowed for 50 miles the whole day. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Calculate the total distance the two of them rowed on that day.",
    "completion": "To calculate the total distance that Dijana and Anis rowed on that day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the distance Anis rowed.\n2. Add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance.\n\nFirst, we know that Dijana rowed 50 miles the whole day. Anis rowed \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) times more miles than Dijana. Therefore, the distance Anis rowed is:\n\\[\n50 + \\frac{1}{5} \\times 50 = 50 + 10 = 60 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance:\n\\[\n50 + 60 = 110 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nSo, the total distance that Dijana and Anis rowed on that day is \\(\\boxed{110}\\) miles.",
    "answer": "Anis rowed for 1/5 * 50 = <<1/5*50=10>>10 more miles than Dijana.\nThe total distance Anis covered is 50 + 10 = <<50+10=60>>60 miles.\nThe two of them rowed for 60 + 50 = <<60+50=110>>110 miles on that day.\n#### 110"
