    "question": "Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?",
    "completion": "To determine how many buttons Lorraine has by the end, we need to follow the trades step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of stickers:**\n   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.\n\n2. **Trading small stickers:**\n   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.\n   - Number of small stickers traded: \\( 0.9 \\times 40 = 36 \\) small stickers.\n   - Number of large stickers traded: \\( 0.9 \\times 30 = 27 \\) large stickers.\n   - Total number of stickers traded: \\( 36 + 27 = 63 \\) stickers.\n\n3. **Trading large stickers:**\n   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.\n   - Number of large stickers traded: \\( 0.5 \\times 27 = 13.5 \\) large stickers.\n   - Since she can't trade a fraction of a sticker, she trades 13 large stickers for large buttons.\n   - Number of large buttons traded: \\( 13 \\) large buttons.\n   - Total number of buttons traded: \\( 13 \\) large buttons.\n\n4. **Total number of buttons:**\n   - Total number of buttons = Number of large buttons + Number of small buttons.\n   - Total number of buttons = \\( 13 + 40 = 53 \\).\n\nThus, by the end, Lorraine has \\(\\boxed{53}\\) buttons.",
    "answer": "She trades 27 small stickers because 30 x .9 = <<27=27>>27\nShe gets 9 large buttons for these because 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9\nShe trades 20 large stickers for large buttons because 40 x .5 = 20\nShe gets 20 large buttons for these because 20 / 1 = <<20/1=20>>20\nShe trades 50% of her large stickers for small buttons because 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50\nShe trades 20 large stickers for small buttons because 40 x .5 = 20\nShe gets 60 small buttons because 20 x 3 = <<20*3=60>>60\nShe has 89 buttons at the end because 9 + 20 + 60 = <<9+20+60=89>>89\n#### 89"
