    "question": "Jim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. How many square feet of fabric does Jim need to buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how many square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy, we first need to calculate the area of the bed and the two additional pieces of fabric.\n\n1. **Calculate the area of the bed:**\n   The bed is a rectangle with a length of 6 feet and a width of 8 feet.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of the bed} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 6 \\times 8 = 48 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the area of each additional piece of fabric:**\n   Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, the dimensions of each piece are:\n   - Length: \\(6 + 2 = 8\\) feet\n   - Width: \\(8 + 2 = 10\\) feet\n\n   The area of each piece of fabric is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of each piece} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 8 \\times 10 = 80 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total area of the two pieces of fabric:**\n   Since there are two pieces of fabric, the total area is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area} = 2 \\times \\text{Area of each piece} = 2 \\times 80 = 160 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jim needs to buy \\(\\boxed{160}\\) square feet of fabric.",
    "answer": "First find the length of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's length: 6 feet + 2 feet = <<6+2=8>>8 feet\nThen find the width of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's width: 8 feet + 2 feet = <<8+2=10>>10 feet\nThen find the square footage of each piece of fabric by multiplying its length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = <<8*10=80>>80 square feet\nThen double that amount since Jim needs two pieces of fabric: 80 square feet/piece * 2 pieces = <<80*2=160>>160 square feet\n#### 160"
