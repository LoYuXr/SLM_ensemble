    "question": "Elise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full twice, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Elise written in total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **First Rewrite:**\n   Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. The alphabet consists of 26 letters.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total letters written in full} = 26 \\times 2 = 52\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Rewrite:**\n   Elise writes half of the letters she has already written. Since she has written 52 letters in total, half of this amount is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Letters written in half} = \\frac{52}{2} = 26\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Rewrite:**\n   Elise re-writes everything she has already written. Since she has written 52 letters in total, she re-writes all of them:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Letters written in re-writes} = 52\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Letters Written:**\n   To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters written in full, half, and re-written:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total letters written} = 52 + 26 + 52 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of letters Elise has written is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",
    "answer": "Elise has written the alphabet twice which is a total of 26 * 2 = <<26*2=52>>52 letters.\nShe then writes half the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = <<26/2=13>>13 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 52 + 13 = <<52+13=65>>65 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 65 * 2 = <<65*2=130>>130 letters.\n#### 130"
