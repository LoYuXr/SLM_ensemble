    "question": "A football team played 22 games. They won 8 more than they lost. How many did they win?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the number of games the football team won as \\( W \\) and the number of games they lost as \\( L \\). According to the problem, the total number of games played is 22, so we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ W + L = 22 \\]\n\nWe are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write another equation:\n\n\\[ W = L + 8 \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1. \\( W + L = 22 \\)\n2. \\( W = L + 8 \\)\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \\( L \\):\n\n\\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \\]\n\\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \\]\n\\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \\]\n\\[ 2L = 14 \\]\n\\[ L = 7 \\]\n\nNow that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \\( L \\) back into the second equation:\n\n\\[ W = L + 8 \\]\n\\[ W = 7 + 8 \\]\n\\[ W = 15 \\]\n\nSo, the football team won 15 games.",
    "answer": "Let L be the number of losses.\nThe number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.\nThe team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.\nSo, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14\nSo L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.\nTherefore, the team won 22 \u2013 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.\n#### 15"
