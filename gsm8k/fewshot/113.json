    "question": "Ryan plants 2 flowers a day in his garden. After 15 days, how many flowers does he have if 5 did not grow?",
    "completion": "To determine how many flowers Ryan has after 15 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of flowers Ryan plants in 15 days.\n2. Subtract the number of flowers that did not grow.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of flowers Ryan plants in 15 days. Since he plants 2 flowers a day, we multiply the number of days by the number of flowers per day:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ days} \\times 2 \\text{ flowers/day} = 30 \\text{ flowers} \\]\n\nNext, we need to account for the fact that 5 flowers did not grow. So, we subtract these 5 flowers from the total number of flowers planted:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ flowers} - 5 \\text{ flowers} = 25 \\text{ flowers} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of flowers Ryan has after 15 days is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
    "answer": "Ryan plants 2*15=<<2*15=30>>30 flowers in total.\nGiven 5 plants did not grow, he has 30-5=<<30-5=25>>25 flowers in his garden.\n#### 25"
