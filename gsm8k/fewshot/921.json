    "question": "A loaf of bread has 24 slices. If Abby can eat 2 slices a day while Josh can eat twice as much, how many days will the loaf of bread last?",
    "completion": "To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by Abby and Josh each day and then divide the total number of slices by the number of slices consumed per day.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many slices Abby eats per day. Abby can eat 2 slices per day.\n\nNext, let's find out how many slices Josh eats per day. Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ slices/day} \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ slices/day} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of slices eaten by Abby and Josh per day to find the total number of slices consumed per day:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ slices/day} + 4 \\text{ slices/day} = 6 \\text{ slices/day} \\]\n\nThe loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the bread will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices consumed per day:\n\\[ \\frac{24 \\text{ slices}}{6 \\text{ slices/day}} = 4 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, the loaf of bread will last for \\(\\boxed{4}\\) days.",
    "answer": "Josh can eat 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 slices a day.\nTogether, Abby and Josh can eat 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 slices a day.\nSo, a loaf of bread will last for 24/6 = <<24/6=4>>4 days.\n#### 4"
