    "question": "A treasure hunter found a buried treasure chest filled with gems. There were 175 diamonds, 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and twice the number of emeralds than the rubies.   How many of the gems were there in the chest?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Diamonds**: The problem states that there are 175 diamonds.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of diamonds} = 175\n   \\]\n\n2. **Ruthies**: The problem states that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Therefore, the number of rubies is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140\n   \\]\n\n3. **Emeralds**: The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds than rubies. Therefore, the number of emeralds is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \\times 140 = 280\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems in the chest:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of gems in the chest is \\(\\boxed{595}\\).",
    "answer": "There were 175 - 35 = <<175-35=140>>140 rubies in the treasure chest.\nThere were 140 x 2 = <<140*2=280>>280 emeralds in the treasure chest.\nSo, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 175 + 140 + 280 = <<175+140+280=595>>595.\n#### 595"
