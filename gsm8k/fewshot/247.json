    "question": "Isabelle bought party supplies for her little sister\u2019s birthday party. She spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on birthday presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags for the party guests. She split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents. How many dollars did each person pay?",
    "completion": "To determine how many dollars each person paid, we first need to calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual costs:\n\n\\[\n12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22\n\\]\n\nLet's add these step by step:\n\n\\[\n12 + 43 = 55\n\\]\n\\[\n55 + 15 = 70\n\\]\n\\[\n70 + 4 = 74\n\\]\n\\[\n74 + 22 = 96\n\\]\n\nSo, Isabelle spent a total of $96 on party supplies.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much each person paid. Since Isabelle split the cost evenly among her two parents, we divide the total amount by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{3} = 32\n\\]\n\nTherefore, each person paid \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Isabelle spent 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = $<<12+43+15+4+22=96>>96 on party supplies.\nThe cost was evenly split 3 ways, so each person paid 96 / 3 = $<<96/3=32>>32.\n#### 32"
