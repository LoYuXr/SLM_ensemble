    "question": "Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup milk. If flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk does Mark have to buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies and then compare the quantities.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of flour needed:\n- The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour.\n- For a quadruple batch, the total amount of flour needed is \\(3 \\text{ cups} \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ cups}\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of milk needed:\n- The normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk.\n- For a quadruple batch, the total amount of milk needed is \\(1 \\text{ cup} \\times 4 = 4 \\text{ cups}\\).\n\nNow, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark has to buy. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we need to find out how many 2-cup bags are required for 12 cups of flour:\n\\[ \\frac{12 \\text{ cups}}{2 \\text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \\text{ bags of flour} \\]\n\nSince milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we need to find out how many 2-cup bottles are required for 4 cups of milk:\n\\[ \\frac{4 \\text{ cups}}{2 \\text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \\text{ bottles of milk} \\]\n\nFinally, we compare the quantities:\n- Mark has 6 bags of flour.\n- Mark has 2 bottles of milk.\n\nTherefore, Mark has \\(\\boxed{4}\\) more bags of flour than bottles of milk.",
    "answer": "To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 3 cups * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 cups of flour.\nTo get 12 cups of flour, Mark needs to buy: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = <<12/2=6>>6 bags\nTo make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 1 cup * 4 = <<1*4=4>>4 cups of milk\nTo get 4 cups of milk, Mark needs to buy: 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = <<4/2=2>>2 bottles of milk\nFinally, subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour to find the difference: 6 - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4\n#### 4"
