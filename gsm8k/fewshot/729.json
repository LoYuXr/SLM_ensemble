    "question": "At 8:00, 5000 people lined up at a polling station to cast their vote on election day. By midday 2/5 of the people had voted and by 16:00 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. What's the number of those who had not voted by 16:00?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of people who did not vote by 16:00, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of people who voted by 8:00.\n2. Determine the number of people who voted by 16:00.\n3. Calculate the number of people who did not vote by 16:00.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of people who voted by 8:00.**\n\nAt 8:00, 5000 people lined up to vote. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. So, the number of people who voted by 8:00 is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\times 5000 = 2000\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of people who voted by 16:00.**\n\nBy 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. The number of people who remained after 8:00 is:\n\\[\n5000 - 2000 = 3000\n\\]\nSo, the number of people who voted by 16:00 is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 3000 = 2000\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of people who did not vote by 16:00.**\n\nThe number of people who did not vote by 16:00 is the total number of people who did not vote by 8:00 minus the number of people who voted by 16:00:\n\\[\n5000 - 2000 = 3000\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is \\boxed{3000}.",
    "answer": "If the number of people who turned up to vote was 5000, by midday 2/5*5000 = <<2/5*5000=2000>>2000 had voted.\nThe number of voters who had not cast their vote is 5000-2000 = <<5000-2000=3000>>3000\nBy 16:00, the additional number of voters who had cast their vote is 2/3*3000 = <<2/3*3000=2000>>2000\nThe number of people who had not cast their votes by 16:00 is 3000-2000 = <<3000-2000=1000>>1000 voters.\n#### 1000"
