    "question": "Paul is at a train station and is waiting for his train. He isn't sure how long he needs to wait, but he knows that the fourth train scheduled to arrive at the station is the one he needs to get on. The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes, and this train will stay in the station for 20 minutes. The second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, and this second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station. The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, and this third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives.  The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves, and this is the train Paul will board.  In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?",
    "completion": "To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the total time from the first train's departure until the fourth train's arrival.\n\n1. **First Train Departure:**\n   - The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes.\n\n2. **First Train Stay in Station:**\n   - The first train will stay in the station for 20 minutes.\n\n3. **Second Train Departure:**\n   - The second train is scheduled to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station.\n   - Half an hour is 30 minutes.\n   - The second train will leave the station after the first train has been in the station for 30 minutes.\n   - Therefore, the second train will stay in the station for \\(30 \\text{ minutes} + 30 \\text{ minutes} = 60 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\n4. **Second Train Stay in Station:**\n   - The second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station.\n   - The first train stayed in the station for 20 minutes.\n   - A quarter of 20 minutes is \\(\\frac{20 \\text{ minutes}}{4} = 5 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\n5. **Third Train Departure:**\n   - The third train is scheduled to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station.\n   - An hour is 60 minutes.\n   - The third train will leave the station immediately after the second train arrives.\n   - Therefore, the third train will depart after the second train has been in the station for 60 minutes.\n\n6. **Third Train Stay in Station:**\n   - The third train will stay in the station for 5 minutes.\n\n7. **Fourth Train Departure:**\n   - The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station.\n   - The third train has been in the station for 60 minutes.\n   - Therefore, the fourth train will arrive after the third train has been in the station for \\(60 \\text{ minutes} + 20 \\text{ minutes} = 80 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\n8. **Fourth Train Stay in Station:**\n   - The fourth train will stay in the station for 5 minutes.\n\n9. **Total Time from Departure to Arrival:**\n   - The total time from the first train's departure until",
    "answer": "The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.\nSo Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.\nThe second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.\nIt then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.\nSo Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.\nThe third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.\nAfter the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.\n#### 145"
