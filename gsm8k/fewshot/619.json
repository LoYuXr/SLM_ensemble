    "question": "Each pole on a road intersection has 4 street lights. If the number of poles at each intersection is 6, and the road has 4 intersections, calculate the total number of functioning street lights if 20 streetlights from the total number are not working.",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of street lights at all the intersections.\n2. Determine the number of street lights that are not working.\n3. Subtract the number of non-working street lights from the total number of street lights to find the number of functioning street lights.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of street lights at all the intersections. Since each intersection has 6 street lights and there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ street lights/intersection} \\times 4 \\text{ intersections} = 24 \\text{ street lights} \\]\n\nNext, we know that 20 streetlights are not working. Therefore, the number of functioning street lights is:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ street lights} - 20 \\text{ non-working street lights} = 4 \\text{ functioning street lights} \\]\n\nSo, the total number of functioning street lights is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]",
    "answer": "If the number of poles at each intersection is 6, and the road has 4 intersections, the total number of poles having street lights is 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24\nSince each pole on a road intersection has 4 street lights, the total number of streetlights in all the poles is 24*4=<<24*4=96>>96\nIf 20 streetlights from the total number are not working, the number of functioning street lights is 96-20=<<96-20=76>>76\n#### 76"
