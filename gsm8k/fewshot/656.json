    "question": "Mike's teacher, leaves as homework the reading of a 200-page book. The assignment is to be completed within 30 days. Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. How many days before the deadline will Mike finish his reading?",
    "completion": "To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pages Mike needs to read.\n2. Determine how many days it will take for Mike to read the required number of pages.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of pages Mike needs to read:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many days it will take for Mike to read 200 pages if he reads 10 pages per day. We do this by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:\n\\[ \\frac{200 \\text{ pages}}{10 \\text{ pages/day}} = 20 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, Mike will finish his reading 20 days before the deadline. The answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
    "answer": "Reading 10 pages per day, Mike finishes reading his book in 200 \u00f7 10 = <<200/10=20>>20 days.\nMike finishes reading his book 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 days before the deadline.\n#### 10"
