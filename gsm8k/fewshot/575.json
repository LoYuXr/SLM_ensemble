    "question": "At the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces.  The teacher agreed.  Kate took the crayons home and decided to make crayon muffins by melting 8 small pieces of crayons together in a muffin tin that she placed in an oven for a few minutes. If she can sell her muffin crayons for $1.50 each, how much money can Kate make?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Kate can make from selling her muffin crayons, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of crayons:**\n   - Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each.\n   - Total number of crayons = \\( 3 \\times 64 = 192 \\) crayons.\n\n2. **Determine how many muffin crayons can be made:**\n   - Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together.\n   - Each muffin crayon is made by melting 8 pieces of crayons.\n   - Number of muffin crayons = \\( \\frac{8}{8} = 1 \\) muffin crayon.\n\n3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the muffin crayons:**\n   - Each muffin crayon is sold for $1.50.\n   - Total revenue = \\( 1 \\times 1.50 = 1.50 \\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, Kate can make a total of **$1.50** from selling her muffin crayons.",
    "answer": "She was able to get 3 boxes of 64 crayons so she has 3*64 = <<3*64=192>>192 crayons\nEach crayon muffin needs 8 crayons and she has 192 crayons so she can make 192/8 = <<192/8=24>>24 crayon muffins\nIf she makes 24 crayon muffins and sells them for $1.50 apiece, she can make 24*1.5 = $<<24*1.5=36.00>>36.00\n#### 36"
