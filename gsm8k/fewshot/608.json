    "question": "Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25. He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discounted price of the shirt.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts.\n3. Calculate the sales tax on the total cost.\n4. Add the sales tax to the total cost to get the final amount Joe will pay.\n5. Subtract the final amount from Joe's initial $50 to find out how much money he will have left.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the discounted price of the shirt:**\n   The original price of the shirt is $25. With a 30% discount, the discount amount is:\n   \\[\n   25 \\times 0.30 = 7.50\n   \\]\n   So, the discounted price of the shirt is:\n   \\[\n   25 - 7.50 = 17.50\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts:**\n   The cost of the shirt is $17.50 and the cost of the shorts is $35. Therefore, the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   17.50 + 35 = 52.50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the sales tax on the total cost:**\n   The sales tax rate is 8% (since 100% - 30% = 70%, and 70% / 100 = 0.70, so 100% - 0.70 = 90%).\n   The sales tax amount is:\n   \\[\n   52.50 \\times 0.08 = 4.20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Add the sales tax to the total cost to get the final amount Joe will pay:**\n   The final amount Joe will pay is:\n   \\[\n   52.50 + 4.20 = 56.70\n   \\]\n\n5. **Subtract the final amount from Joe's initial $50 to find out how much money he will have left:**\n   \\[\n   50 - 56.70 = -6.70\n   \\]\n   Since the result is negative, it means Joe will have $6.70 left after the purchase.\n\nTherefore, the",
    "answer": "The price of the two clothing items totals 35 + 25 = <<35+25=60>>60 dollars before discount.\nThe total sale discount comes to 60 * 0.3 = <<60*0.3=18>>18 dollars.\nThe final sale price comes to 60 - 18 = <<60-18=42>>42 dollars.\nJoe ends up with 50 - 42 = <<50-42=8>>8 dollars change.\n#### 8"
