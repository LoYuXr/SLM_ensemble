    "question": "Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day, and over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all. During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?",
    "completion": "To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the distance traveled each day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:\n- Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for the first 4 days.\n- The total distance for the first 4 days is:\n  \\[\n  200 \\text{ km/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days} = 800 \\text{ km}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the next two days:\n- Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first 4 days.\n- The distance traveled over the first 4 days is 800 kilometers.\n- The distance traveled in the next two days is:\n  \\[\n  0.30 \\times 800 \\text{ km} = 240 \\text{ km}\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled on the next day:\n- Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day for the next day.\n- The distance traveled on the next day is:\n  \\[\n  300 \\text{ km/day} \\times 1 \\text{ day} = 300 \\text{ km}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, let's sum up the distances traveled over the entire two-week period:\n- The total distance traveled in the first 4 days is 800 kilometers.\n- The total distance traveled in the next two days is 240 kilometers.\n- The distance traveled on the next day is 300 kilometers.\n- The total distance traveled during the two-week period is:\n  \\[\n  800 \\text{ km} + 240 \\text{ km} + 300 \\text{ km} = 1340 \\text{ km}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is \\(\\boxed{1340}\\) kilometers.",
    "answer": "In the first four days, Tom made 4 * 200 = <<4*200=800>>800 kilometers.\nFor the next two days, he made only 30/100 * 800 = <<30/100*800=240>>240 kilometers.\nDuring the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day, which means 7 * 300 = <<7*300=2100>>2100 kilometers during the whole week.\nDuring his whole trip, Tom made 800 + 240 + 2100 = <<800+240+2100=3140>>3140 kilometers.\n#### 3140"
