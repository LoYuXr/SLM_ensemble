    "question": "Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle. If the cat can run 15 feet/second, how many feet can her turtle crawl in 40 seconds?",
    "completion": "To determine how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the speed of the turtle:**\n   - We know that the cat can run 15 feet per second.\n   - The cat's speed is 5 times faster than the turtle's speed.\n   - Therefore, the turtle's speed is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Turtle's speed} = \\frac{\\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \\frac{15 \\text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \\text{ feet/second}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:**\n   - The turtle's speed is 3 feet per second.\n   - In 40 seconds, the turtle can crawl:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = \\text{Turtle's speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 3 \\text{ feet/second} \\times 40 \\text{ seconds} = 120 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the turtle can crawl \\(\\boxed{120}\\) feet in 40 seconds.",
    "answer": "First find the speed of the turtle by dividing the cat's speed by 5: 15 feet/second / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 feet/second\nThen multiply the turtle's speed by the number of seconds it spends crawling to find how far it crawls: 40 seconds * 3 feet/second = <<40*3=120>>120 feet\n#### 120"
