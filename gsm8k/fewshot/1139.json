    "question": "Russell orders his favorite bagels online.  Each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels in the pack.  If he orders 4 packs of bagels, he will receive a 10% discount.  After ordering 4 bags, how much will each single bagel cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost of each single bagel after the discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount.\n2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.\n3. Determine the cost per bagel after the discount.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ packs} \\times \\$10.00 \\text{ per pack} = \\$40.00\n\\]\n\nNext, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:\n\\[\n10\\% \\text{ of } \\$40.00 = 0.10 \\times \\$40.00 = \\$4.00\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Discounted total cost} = \\$40.00 - \\$4.00 = \\$36.00\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the cost per bagel after the discount:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per bagel} = \\frac{\\$36.00}{4 \\text{ packs}} = \\$9.00 \\text{ per pack}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost per single bagel after the discount is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9.00}\n\\]",
    "answer": "He orders 4 packs of bagels and each pack costs $10.00 so that's 4*10 = $<<4*10=40.00>>40.00\nHe orders 4 packs at $40.00 and receives a 10% discount so his discount is 40*.10 = $4.00\nThe bagels cost $40.00 and he has a $4.00 discount making his total 40-4 = $<<40-4=36.00>>36.00\nEach pack of bagels has 9 bagels per pack and he orders 4 packs so that's 9*4 = <<9*4=36>>36 bagels\nHis order total was $36.00 and there are 36 bagels so each bagel costs 36/36 = $<<36/36=1.00>>1.00\n#### 1"
