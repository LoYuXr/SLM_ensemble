    "question": "There are 6 trees in Chris's yard.  Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has.  Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.  How many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of trees Ferdinand has:**\n   - Chris has 6 trees.\n   - Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of trees Harry has:**\n   - Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \\times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the difference between the number of trees Harry has and the number of trees Ferdinand has:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8\n   \\]\n\nThus, Harry has 8 more trees in his yard than Ferdinand.",
    "answer": "Ferdinand:6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 trees\nHarry:5+2(3)=5+6=11 trees\n11-3=<<11-3=8>>8 trees\n#### 8"
