    "question": "A jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. How many jellyfish are in the tank?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the number of large jellyfish:**\n   - A fifth of the jellyfish are large.\n   - Let \\( L \\) be the total number of large jellyfish.\n   - Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is \\( \\frac{L}{5} \\).\n\n2. **Identify the number of small jellyfish:**\n   - The remaining jellyfish are small.\n   - The total number of jellyfish is \\( L + \\frac{L}{5} = \\frac{6L}{5} \\).\n\n3. **Identify the number of jellyfish that change color:**\n   - A third of the large jellyfish change color.\n   - The number of large jellyfish that change color is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{L}{5} = \\frac{L}{15} \\).\n   - The number of small jellyfish that change color is 6.\n   - Therefore, the total number of jellyfish that change color is \\( \\frac{L}{15} + 6 \\).\n\n4. **Set up the equation:**\n   - The total number of jellyfish that change color is equal to the number of large jellyfish that change color.\n   - Therefore, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{L}{15} + 6 = \\frac{L}{5}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( L \\):**\n   - First, eliminate the fractions by finding a common denominator, which is 15:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{L}{15} + 6 = \\frac{3L}{15}\n     \\]\n   - Subtract \\( \\frac{L}{15} \\) from both sides:\n     \\[\n     6 = \\frac{3L}{15} - \\frac{L}{15}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the right side:\n     \\[\n     6 = \\frac{2L}{15}\n     \\]\n   - Multiply both sides by 15 to solve for \\( L \\):\n     \\[\n     90 = 2L\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 2:\n     \\[\n     L = 45\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total number of jellyfish:**\n   - The total",
    "answer": "A third of the large jellyfish change color, so there are 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 large jellyfish.\nA fifth of the jellyfish are large, so there are 18 * 5 = <<18*5=90>>90 jellyfish in the tank.\n#### 90"
