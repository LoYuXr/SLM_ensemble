    "question": "Charlotte went into the kitchen supply store knowing she wanted a set of pot and pans for $120.00, a set of mixing bowls for $20.00 and 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each.  At check out, the clerk told her everything was 20% off.  How much was her order?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of Charlotte's order after the 20% discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.\n2. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost.\n3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:\n   - Pot and pans: $120.00\n   - Mixing bowls: $20.00\n   - 5 separate utensils: $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00\n\n   Adding these together:\n   \\[\n   120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00\n   \\]\n\n2. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost:\n   - The discount is 20% of $165.00.\n   - 20% of $165.00 is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     0.20 \\times 165.00 = 33.00\n     \\]\n\n   Subtract the discount from the total cost:\n   \\[\n   165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Charlotte paid for her order is \\(\\boxed{132.00}\\).",
    "answer": "She wants 5 utensils at $5.00 each so they cost 5*5 = $<<5*5=25.00>>25.00\nThe utensils are $25, the pots and pans are $120 and the mixing bowls are $20 for a total of 25+120+20 = $<<25+120+20=165>>165\nEverything is 20% off, and her total is $165 so 165*.20= $<<165*.20=33.00>>33.00\nThe total was $165 and she gets a $33.00 discount so 165-33 = $<<165-33=132.00>>132.00 is her total price\n#### 132"
