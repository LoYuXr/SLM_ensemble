    "question": "Mary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them for a cocktail party. She makes some strawberry cubes, and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes total, how many blueberry cubes does she make?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \\( S \\). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \\( 5S - 4 \\). The total number of ice cubes she makes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ S + 5S - 4 = 116 \\]\n\\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve for \\( S \\). First, we add 4 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 6S = 120 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 6:\n\n\\[ S = 20 \\]\n\nSo, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. The number of blueberry cubes she makes is \\( 5S - 4 \\). Substituting \\( S = 20 \\) into this expression, we get:\n\n\\[ 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
    "answer": "Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second, we get s + 5s - 4 = 116.\nCombining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120\nDividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20\nSubstituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96\n#### 96"
