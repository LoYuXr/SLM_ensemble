    "question": "Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1. How much money does he save by buying 18 flowers at the better price?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers at each price point and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price of 3 flowers per package:\n- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.\n- Therefore, the cost for 18 flowers is:\n  \\[\n  18 \\text{ flowers} \\times 3 \\text{ flowers/package} = 54 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price of 2 flowers per package:\n- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.\n- Therefore, the cost for 18 flowers is:\n  \\[\n  18 \\text{ flowers} \\times 2 \\text{ flowers/package} = 36 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the two costs to determine the savings:\n\\[\n54 \\text{ dollars} - 36 \\text{ dollars} = 18 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, Vincent saves \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price.",
    "answer": "Find how many packages of 3 would be needed which is 18 \u00f7 3 = <<18/3=6>>6.\nThe cost of using packages of 3 is 6 \u00d7 $2.50 = $<<6*2.5=15>>15.\nFind how many packages of 2 would be needed which is 18 \u00f7 2 = <<18/2=9>>9.\nThe cost of using packages of 2 is 9 \u00d7 $1 = $<<9*1=9>>9.\nVincent would save $15 - $9 = $<<15-9=6>>6.\n#### 6"
