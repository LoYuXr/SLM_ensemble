    "question": "There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but John has to take 2 extra classes.  Each class is 40 minutes long.  He goes to class for 5 days a week.  He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning?",
    "completion": "To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate the total time spent on learning each day and then sum it up for the week.\n\n1. **Calculate the total time spent on classes each day:**\n   John has to take 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long. Therefore, the total time spent on classes each day is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 40 = 80 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total time spent on extra learning time each day:**\n   John spends \\(\\frac{1}{16}\\) of his weekly minutes on extra learning time each day. Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, the total time spent on extra learning time each day is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{5}{16} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total time spent on extra learning time each week:**\n   Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on extra learning time each week is:\n   \\[\n   7 \\times \\frac{5}{16} = \\frac{35}{16} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total time spent on learning each week:**\n   The total time spent on learning each week is the sum of the time spent on classes and the time spent on extra learning time:\n   \\[\n   80 + \\frac{35}{16} = \\frac{1280}{16} + \\frac{35}{16} = \\frac{1315}{16} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert the total time spent on learning to hours:**\n   To convert the total time spent on learning from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1315}{16} \\times 60 = 1315 \\times 3.75 = 4868.75 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n   Converting minutes to hours:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4868.75}{60} = 81.1125 \\text{ hours}\n  ",
    "answer": "He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day\nThat means he spends 40*8=<<40*8=320>>320 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 320*5=<<320*5=1600>>1600 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 1600/16=<<1600/16=100>>100 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday\nSo he spends 1600+100+100=<<1600+100+100=1800>>1800 minutes per week\nSo he spends 1800/60=<<1800/60=30>>30 hours per week\n#### 30"
