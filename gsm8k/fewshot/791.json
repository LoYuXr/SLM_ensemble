    "question": "A train has 172 people traveling on it. At the first stop 47 people get off and 13 more people get on, and at the next stop another 38 people get off. How many people are on the train?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of people on the train after the specified stops, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of people on the train.\n2. Subtract the number of people who get off at the first stop.\n3. Add the number of people who get on at the first stop.\n4. Subtract the number of people who get off at the second stop.\n5. Add the number of people who get on at the second stop.\n\nLet's go through these steps in detail:\n\n1. Initial number of people on the train: 172\n2. After the first stop, 47 people get off:\n   \\[\n   172 - 47 = 125\n   \\]\n3. After the first stop, 13 more people get on:\n   \\[\n   125 + 13 = 138\n   \\]\n4. After the second stop, 38 people get off:\n   \\[\n   138 - 38 = 100\n   \\]\n5. After the second stop, 13 more people get on:\n   \\[\n   100 + 13 = 113\n   \\]\n\nSo, the number of people on the train after all the stops is \\(\\boxed{113}\\).",
    "answer": "At the first stop 172 people - 47 people = <<172-47=125>>125 people are on the train.\nThen 13 more people get on increasing it to 125 people + 13 people = <<13+125=138>>138 people.\nAt the next stop 138 people - 38 people = <<138-38=100>>100 people remain on the train.\n#### 100"
