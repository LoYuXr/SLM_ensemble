    "question": "John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours in the week.  If he spends 50 dollars on gas and wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, how many 25 dollar pens can he buy after he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each?",
    "completion": "To determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy after his purchases, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate John's total earnings for the week.\n2. Subtract the cost of the gas from his total earnings.\n3. Subtract the cost of the 5 pencils from the remaining amount.\n4. Determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining amount.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate John's total earnings for the week:**\n   John earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours in the week.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total earnings} = 50 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 300 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the cost of the gas from his total earnings:**\n   John spends 50 dollars on gas.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining amount after gas} = 300 \\text{ dollars} - 50 \\text{ dollars} = 250 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the cost of the 5 pencils from the remaining amount:**\n   Each pencil costs 10 dollars, and John has 5 pencils.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining amount after pencils} = 250 \\text{ dollars} - 5 \\times 10 \\text{ dollars} = 250 \\text{ dollars} - 50 \\text{ dollars} = 200 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining amount:**\n   Each 25 dollar pen costs 25 dollars.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of 25 dollar pens} = \\frac{200 \\text{ dollars}}{25 \\text{ dollars/pen}} = 8 \\text{ pens}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, after buying 5 pencils and spending 50 dollars on gas, John can buy \\boxed{8} 25 dollar pens.",
    "answer": "He earned $50*6=$<<50*6=300>>300\nHe has $300 - $100 = $<<300-100=200>>200 to spend\nHe spends 5 * $10 = $<<5*10=50>>50 on pencils\nAfter buying gas and pencils he has $200 - $50 - $50 = $<<200-50-50=100>>100 to spend on pens\nHe can buy $100/25=<<100/25=4>>4 pens\n#### 4"
