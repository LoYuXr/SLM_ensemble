    "question": "Oscar has 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school.  He passes 14 out to his friends.  He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends.  He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning.  How many lollipops does Oscar have?",
    "completion": "To determine how many lollipops Oscar has left, we need to follow the steps of the problem carefully.\n\n1. **Initial number of lollipops:**\n   Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.\n\n2. **Lollipops eaten by Oscar:**\n   Oscar eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.\n   \\[\n   24 - 2 = 22\n   \\]\n   So, after eating 2 lollipops, Oscar has 22 lollipops left.\n\n3. **Lollipops given to friends:**\n   Oscar passes 14 lollipops to his friends.\n   \\[\n   22 + 14 = 36\n   \\]\n   So, after giving 14 lollipops to his friends, Oscar has 36 lollipops left.\n\n4. **Lollipops bought on the way home:**\n   Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave 14 lollipops to his friends, he buys:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 14 = 28\n   \\]\n   So, he buys 28 lollipops on his way home.\n   \\[\n   36 + 28 = 64\n   \\]\n   So, after buying 28 lollipops, Oscar has 64 lollipops left.\n\n5. **Lollipops eaten that night and the next day:**\n   Oscar eats 3 more lollipops that night and 2 more lollipops in the morning.\n   \\[\n   64 - 3 = 61\n   \\]\n   So, after eating 3 more lollipops that night and 2 more lollipops in the morning, Oscar has 61 lollipops left.\n\nTherefore, the number of lollipops Oscar has left is \\(\\boxed{61}\\).",
    "answer": "He has 24 lollipops, eats 2 and passes 14 out to his friends so that\u2019s 24-2-14 = <<24-2-14=8>>8 lollipops are left\nOn his way home he buys twice the amount of the 14 that he passed out so he bought 2*14 = <<2*14=28>>28 lollipops\nHe now has 8+28 = <<8+28=36>>36 lollipops\nHe has 36, eats 3 that night and 2 more in the morning leaving him with 36-3-2 = <<36-3-2=31>>31 lollipops\n#### 31"
