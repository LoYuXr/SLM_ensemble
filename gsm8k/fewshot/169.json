    "question": "Pancho walks 20 miles a day. Except on weekends when he walks 10 miles. How many miles does he walk in a week?",
    "completion": "To determine how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of days Pancho walks on weekdays:**\n   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.\n   - Pancho walks 20 miles each weekday.\n   - Therefore, the total miles walked on weekdays is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ weekdays} \\times 20 \\text{ miles/day} = 100 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of days Pancho walks on weekends:**\n   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.\n   - Pancho walks 10 miles each weekend day.\n   - Therefore, the total miles walked on weekends is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ weekend days} \\times 10 \\text{ miles/day} = 20 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total miles walked in a week:**\n   - Add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends:\n     \\[\n     100 \\text{ miles} + 20 \\text{ miles} = 120 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Pancho walks a total of \\(\\boxed{120}\\) miles in a week.",
    "answer": "He walks 100 miles during the weekdays because 5 x 20 = <<5*20=100>>100\nHe walks 20 miles on the weekend because 2 x 10 = <<2*10=20>>20\nHe walks 120 miles total because 100 + 20 = <<100+20=120>>120\n#### 120"
