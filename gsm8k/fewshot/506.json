    "question": "Mario needs to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs.  Assuming his dogs each has four legs and each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, how much will it cost him to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's 6 sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of legs for all dogs:**\n   Each dog has 4 legs, and there are 6 dogs.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of legs} = 6 \\text{ dogs} \\times 4 \\text{ legs per dog} = 24 \\text{ legs}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the cost of one pair of snowshoes:**\n   Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of pairs of snowshoes needed:**\n   Since each dog needs one pair of snowshoes, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of pairs of snowshoes} = \\frac{24 \\text{ legs}}{2 \\text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \\text{ pairs}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost for all pairs of snowshoes:**\n   Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 12 \\text{ pairs} \\times 12 \\text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is \\(\\boxed{144}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Dogs have 4 legs and a pair is 2 legs so each dog has 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 pair of legs\nThere are 6 dogs and they each have 2 pair of legs so they have 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 pair of legs\nThe snowshoes cost $12 per pair and he needs to buy 12 pairs so he will spend 12*12 = $<<12*12=144>>144 on snowshoes\n#### 144"
