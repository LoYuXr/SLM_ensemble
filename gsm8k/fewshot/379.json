Janet gave her 42 cookies.\n3. Her brother ate 44 cookies.\n\nFirst, we add the cookies Janet gave her to the cookies Rachel initially bought:\n\\[ 23 + 42 = 65 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the cookies her brother ate from the total number of cookies:\n\\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \\]\n\nSo, the number of cookies left for Rachel is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
