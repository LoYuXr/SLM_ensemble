    "question": "Brenda invested $300 into a scheme that accumulates simple interest at the rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year. How much in total will she have after 3 years?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest earned each year and then sum these amounts over the 3-year period.\n\n1. **Calculate the annual interest rate:**\n   The interest rate is given as three-quarters of the original amount per year. The original amount is $300.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual interest rate} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 300 = 225\\%\n   \\]\n   This means the interest rate is 225% per year.\n\n2. **Calculate the interest earned in each year:**\n   The interest earned each year is the interest rate multiplied by the principal amount.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Interest for the first year} = 225\\% \\times 300 = 225 \\times 3 = 675\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Interest for the second year} = 225\\% \\times 300 = 225 \\times 3 = 675\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Interest for the third year} = 225\\% \\times 300 = 225 \\times 3 = 675\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total interest earned over 3 years:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total interest} = 675 + 675 + 675 = 2025\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount after 3 years:**\n   The total amount after 3 years is the principal plus the total interest earned.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount} = 300 + 2025 = 2325\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is \\(\\boxed{2325}\\).",
    "answer": "Three-quarters of $300 is (3/4)*$300 = $<<(3/4)*300=225>>225\nAfter 3 years, interest of $225*3 = $<<225*3=675>>675 has been accumulated\nShe now has a total of $300+$675 = $<<300+675=975>>975\n#### 975"
