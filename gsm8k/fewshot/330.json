    "question": "A customer\u2019s loyalty card at a store gives them rewards of $1 off their next purchase for every $20 they spend. Their last shopping trip, they spent $80. This shopping trip, they spent $43, used their rewards, and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. How many dollars did the customer pay on this shopping trip?",
    "completion": "To determine how much the customer paid on their shopping trip, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of rewards the customer received:**\n   The customer's loyalty card gives $1 off for every $20 spent. The customer spent $80 in total.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rewards} = \\frac{80}{20} = 4\n   \\]\n   So, the customer received 4 rewards.\n\n2. **Determine the amount of rewards applied:**\n   The customer used their rewards to apply a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since they received 4 rewards, the coupon took:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ dollars off}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the customer paid:\n   \\[\n   80 - 8 = 72 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount paid:**\n   The customer spent $43 in total, and after applying the coupon, they paid $72. The amount paid is:\n   \\[\n   43 - 72 = -29\n   \\]\n   Since the customer paid $29 less than they spent, it means they paid $29 less than the total amount they spent.\n\nThus, the customer paid:\n\\[\n\\boxed{29}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The customer had 80 / 20 = $<<80/20=4>>4 in rewards.\nTheir coupon was worth 4 * 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8.\nThus, they paid 43 - 4 - 8 = $<<43-4-8=31>>31 on this shopping trip.\n#### 31"
