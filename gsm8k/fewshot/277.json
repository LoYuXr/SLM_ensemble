    "question": "It takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig a small hole for shrubs and 10 minutes to dig a large hole for trees.  How many hours will it take him to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes?",
    "completion": "To determine the total time it takes Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of hole separately and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time spent on the small holes:\n- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole.\n- He needs to dig 30 small holes.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time for small holes} = 3 \\text{ minutes/hole} \\times 30 \\text{ holes} = 90 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time spent on the large holes:\n- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig a large hole.\n- He needs to dig 15 large holes.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time for large holes} = 10 \\text{ minutes/hole} \\times 15 \\text{ holes} = 150 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the times for both types of holes to find the total time:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\text{Time for small holes} + \\text{Time for large holes} = 90 \\text{ minutes} + 150 \\text{ minutes} = 240 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time in hours} = \\frac{240 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time it takes Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is \\boxed{4} hours.",
    "answer": "It takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole and he needs to dig 30 small holes so it will take 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 minutes\nIt takes 10 minutes to dig a large hole and he needs to dig 15 large holes so it will take him 15*10 = <<10*15=150>>150 minutes\nIt will take 90 minutes to dig the small holes and 150 minutes to dig the large holes for a total of 90+150 = <<90+150=240>>240 minutes\nThere are 60 minutes in 1 hour and he needs to dig for 240 minutes so that's 240/60 = <<240/60=4>>4 hours\n#### 4"
