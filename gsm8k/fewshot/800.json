    "question": "Pierson scored 278 points in one game of bowling. Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson. How many points did Pierson and Nikita have in total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Pierson's score.\n2. Calculate Nikita's score based on the given information.\n3. Add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together.\n\nFirst, we know that Pierson scored 278 points in one game of bowling. So, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Pierson's score} = 278 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many points Nikita scored. Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. So, we calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11:\n\\[ \\text{Nikita's score} = \\frac{278}{2} + 11 = 139 + 11 = 150 \\]\n\nNow, we add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together to find the total:\n\\[ \\text{Total score} = \\text{Pierson's score} + \\text{Nikita's score} = 278 + 150 = 428 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:\n\\[ \\boxed{428} \\]",
    "answer": "Pierson = <<278=278>>278 points\nNikita = (1/2) 278 + 11 = 150 points\n278 + 150 = <<278+150=428>>428 points\nTogether, Pierson and Nikita scored 428 points.\n#### 428"
