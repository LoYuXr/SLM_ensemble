    "question": "Every hour, Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves in the oven.  Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices and wrapped individually for sale.  Each slice is sold for 50 cents for a fundraiser.  If she baked from 1:00 PM - 6:00 PM straight, and sold all the slices, how much did she raise in dollars?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Paige raised, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of banana bread loaves baked.\n2. Determine the total number of slices from all the loaves.\n3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the slices.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many banana bread loaves Paige baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. Since she bakes 2 banana bread loaves per hour, the total number of loaves baked is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ loaves/hour} \\times 5 \\text{ hours} = 10 \\text{ loaves} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total number of slices from all the loaves. Since each loaf is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ loaves} \\times 8 \\text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nEach slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total revenue from selling all the slices is:\n\\[ 80 \\text{ slices} \\times 50 \\text{ cents/slice} = 4000 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nSince there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the revenue from cents to dollars:\n\\[ 4000 \\text{ cents} \\div 100 = 40 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Paige raised is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",
    "answer": "From 1pm - 6pm, there are 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours.\nIn 5 hours, Paige baked 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 banana bread loaves.\nWhen they are sliced, there are 10 x 8 = <<10*8=80>>80 banana bread slices.\nBy selling all the slices, Paige has raised 80 x 0.50 = $<<80*0.50=40>>40.\n#### 40"
