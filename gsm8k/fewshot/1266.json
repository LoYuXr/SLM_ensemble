    "question": "The Kennel house keeps 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. If a German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food and a bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day. How many kilograms of dog food will they need in a week?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of dog food for both the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs, and then multiply by the number of days in a week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily consumption of dog food for the German Shepherds:\n- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.\n- There are 3 German Shepherds.\n- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\text{ German Shepherds} \\times 5 \\text{ kilograms/Shepherd} = 15 \\text{ kilograms/day}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the daily consumption of dog food for the Bulldogs:\n- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.\n- There are 2 Bulldogs.\n- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ Bulldogs} \\times 3 \\text{ kilograms/Butterfly} = 6 \\text{ kilograms/day}\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's find the total daily consumption of dog food for both the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ kilograms/day} + 6 \\text{ kilograms/day} = 21 \\text{ kilograms/day}\n\\]\n\nFinally, to find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):\n\\[\n21 \\text{ kilograms/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 147 \\text{ kilograms/week}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is \\boxed{147} kilograms.",
    "answer": "The German Shepherds consume 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 kilograms of dog food per day.\nThe Bulldogs consume 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 kilograms of dog food per day.\nThe dogs can consume a total of 15 + 6 = <<15+6=21>>21 kilograms of dog food per day.\nTherefore, they need 21 x 7 = <<21*7=147>>147 kilograms of dog food in a week.\n#### 147"
