    "question": "Mrs. Cruz is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $400 000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $350 000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more the total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the brokerage fee:\nThe brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.\n\\[ \\text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \\times 350,000 = 17,500 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the transfer fee:\nThe transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.\n\\[ \\text{Transfer fee} = 0.12 \\times 350,000 = 42,000 \\]\n\nNow, let's find the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee:\n\\[ \\text{Total price} = \\text{Selling price} + \\text{Brokerage fee} + \\text{Transfer fee} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \\]\n\nFinally, we compare the total price of the house to Mrs. Cruz's budget:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Total price} - \\text{Budget} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.",
    "answer": "The brokerage fee is $350 000 x 5/100 = $<<350000*5/100=17500>>17500.\nThe transfer fee is $350 000 x 12/100 = $<<350000*12/100=42000>>42000.\nThe total price of the house is $350 000 + $17500 + $42000 = $409 500.\nSo, it is $409 500 - $400 000 = $<<409500-400000=9500>>9500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.\n#### 9500"
