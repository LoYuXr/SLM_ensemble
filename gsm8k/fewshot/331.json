    "question": "Nick is choosing between two jobs. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and is in a state with a 20% total tax rate. Job B pays $42,000 a year and is in a state that charges $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax. How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more money Nick will make at the job with a higher net pay rate compared to the other job, we need to calculate the net pay for each job and then compare the two.\n\n### Job A:\n- **Hourly wage:** $15\n- **Hours per year:** 2000 hours\n- **Tax rate:** 20%\n\nFirst, calculate the gross pay:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross pay} = \\text{Hourly wage} \\times \\text{Hours per year} = 15 \\times 2000 = 30000\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the tax:\n\\[\n\\text{Tax} = \\text{Gross pay} \\times \\text{Tax rate} = 30000 \\times 0.20 = 6000\n\\]\n\nSubtract the tax from the gross pay to get the net pay:\n\\[\n\\text{Net pay} = \\text{Gross pay} - \\text{Tax} = 30000 - 6000 = 24000\n\\]\n\n### Job B:\n- **Net income after property tax:** $42,000\n- **Property tax:** $6,000\n- **Tax rate:** 10%\n\nFirst, calculate the net income after property tax:\n\\[\n\\text{Net income after property tax} = \\text{Net income} - \\text{Property tax} = 42000 - 6000 = 36000\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the tax on the net income:\n\\[\n\\text{Tax} = \\text{Net income after property tax} \\times \\text{Tax rate} = 36000 \\times 0.10 = 3600\n\\]\n\nSubtract the tax from the net income to get the net pay:\n\\[\n\\text{Net pay} = \\text{Net income after property tax} - \\text{Tax} = 36000 - 3600 = 32400\n\\]\n\n### Comparison:\n- **Net pay at Job A:** $24,000\n- **Net pay at Job B:** $32,400\n\nThe difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:\n\\[\n\\text{",
    "answer": "First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000\nNext, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000\nNow subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000\nNow subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000\nNow multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600\nNow subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400\nNow subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400\n#### 8400"
