    "question": "Marcel runs a bicycle store. His main products are three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, and a Trekking bike is $450. In one month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes among the types listed. Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during the month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then find the total earnings.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:\n- Half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes. Since the total number of bikes sold is 300, the number of Trekking bikes sold is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{300}{2} = 150\n  \\]\n- 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. The number of BMX bikes sold is:\n  \\[\n  0.15 \\times 300 = 45\n  \\]\n- The rest of the bikes sold were MTB type. The number of MTB bikes sold is:\n  \\[\n  300 - 150 - 45 = 105\n  \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:\n- The earnings from MTB bikes are:\n  \\[\n  105 \\times 500 = 52500\n  \\]\n- The earnings from BMX bikes are:\n  \\[\n  45 \\times 450 = 20250\n  \\]\n- The earnings from Trekking bikes are:\n  \\[\n  150 \\times 450 = 67500\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings:\n\\[\n52500 + 20250 + 67500 = 130250\n\\]\n\nThus, the total earnings from selling bicycles during that month is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{130250}\n\\]",
    "answer": "First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.\nHalf of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.\n15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.\nThe remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.\nThat means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.\nHe also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.\nMTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500\nIn total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.\n#### 131250"
