    "question": "Greta and Celinda are baking cookies. Greta bakes 30 cookies and Celinda bakes twice as many. If the pair eat 10 of the cookies while they are cooling and put the rest in a box, how many cookies are there in the box?",
    "completion": "To determine how many cookies are in the box, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cookies Celinda baked.\n2. Determine the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda.\n3. Subtract the number of cookies eaten by the pair from the total number of cookies baked.\n\nFirst, we know that Greta baked 30 cookies. Celinda baked twice as many cookies as Greta, so we calculate the number of cookies Celinda baked as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of cookies Celinda baked} = 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda by adding the number of cookies baked by each:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of cookies baked} = 30 + 60 = 90 \\]\n\nThe pair ate 10 cookies while they were cooling, so we subtract these 10 cookies from the total number of cookies baked to find out how many cookies are in the box:\n\\[ \\text{Number of cookies in the box} = 90 - 10 = 80 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies in the box is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",
    "answer": "Celinda bakes 30 cookies * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 cookies.\nSo in total, Celinda and Greta bakes a total of 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 cookies.\nAfter eating some of the cookies, they have 90 baked cookies \u2013 10 eaten cookies = <<90-10=80>>80 cookies in the box.\n#### 80"
