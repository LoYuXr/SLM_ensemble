    "question": "Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. Then a boy got 6 liters of water. How many liters of water were left?",
    "completion": "To determine how many liters of water were left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of water that the two girls each got.\n2. Add the amount of water the boy got to the total amount of water the girls got.\n3. Subtract the total amount of water the boy got from the total amount of water the girls got.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\nThe two girls each got \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of the 24 liters of water. So, the amount of water each girl got is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{6} \\times 24 = 4 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nSince there are two girls, the total amount of water the girls got is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 2 = 8 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nNext, we add the amount of water the boy got to the total amount of water the girls got:\n\\[ 8 + 6 = 14 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount of water the boy got from the total amount of water the girls got:\n\\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nSo, the number of liters of water left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",
    "answer": "Each of the girls got 24 x 1/6 = <<24*1/6=4>>4 liters of water.\nSo the two girls got a total of 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 liters.\nThus, a total of 8 + 6 = <<8+6=14>>14 liters of water were gotten by the two girls and the boy.\nTherefore, 24 - 14 = <<24-14=10>>10 liters of water were left.\n#### 10"
