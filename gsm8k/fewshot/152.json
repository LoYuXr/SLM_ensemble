    "question": "Carl buys ten packs of cookies. Each pack of cookies has six cookies inside. Each cookie cost $0.10. How much change does Carl receive if he pay with a $10 bill?",
    "completion": "To determine how much change Carl receives, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys.\n2. Determine the total cost of the cookies.\n3. Subtract the total cost from the amount Carl paid to find the change.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys. Since he buys ten packs and each pack contains six cookies, we can calculate the total number of cookies as follows:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ packs} \\times 6 \\text{ cookies per pack} = 60 \\text{ cookies}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total cost of the cookies. Since each cookie costs $0.10, the total cost for 60 cookies is:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ cookies} \\times 0.10 \\text{ dollars per cookie} = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total cost from the amount Carl paid to find the change:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ dollars} - 6 \\text{ dollars} = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of change Carl receives is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
    "answer": "A pack of cookies costs 6 x $0.10 = $<<6*0.1=0.60>>0.60.\nThus, ten packs of cookies cost 10 x $0.6 = $<<10*0.6=6>>6.\nTherefore, Carl will receive a $10 - $6 = $<<10-6=4>>4 change.\n#### 4"
