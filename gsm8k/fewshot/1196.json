    "question": "Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens and also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red. If each pack has 5 pens, how many pens does Alain have?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of red pens bought.\n2. Calculate the number of black pens bought.\n3. Add the number of red pens and black pens to get the total number of pens.\n\nFirst, we know that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ packs} \\times 5 \\text{ pens per pack} = 25 \\text{ red pens} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, the number of black pens is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 \\text{ packs} = 10 \\text{ black pens} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens:\n\\[ 25 \\text{ red pens} + 10 \\text{ black pens} = 35 \\text{ pens} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pens Alain has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]",
    "answer": "Alain has a total of 5 x 5= <<5*5=25>>25 red pens.\nAnd he has a total of 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 packs of black pens.\nSo, the total number of black pens he has is 10 x 5 = <<10*5=50>>50.\nTherefore, the total number of pens he has is 50 + 25= <<50+25=75>>75.\n#### 75"
