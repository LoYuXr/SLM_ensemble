    "question": "20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win the big race.  60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.  The rest of the people think horse #12 will win the big race.  How many people think that horse #12 will win?",
    "completion": "To determine how many people think horse #12 will win the big race, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win.\n2. Calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win.\n3. Subtract the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people to find out how many people think horse #12 will win.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win:\n   \\[\n   20\\% \\text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \\times 50 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.\n\n2. Calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win:\n   \\[\n   60\\% \\text{ of } 50 = 0.60 \\times 50 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, 30 people think horse #7 will win.\n\n3. Subtract the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people to find out how many people think horse #12 will win:\n   \\[\n   50 - 10 - 30 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, 10 people think horse #12 will win.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win the big race is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
    "answer": "20% of 50 people are pulling for horse #2 so that's .20*50 = <<.20*50=10>>10 people\n10 out of 50 people think horse #2 will win which leaves 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 people\n60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win so that's .60*40 = <<60*.01*40=24>>24 people\nThat leaves 40-24 = <<40-24=16>>16 people that think horse #12 will win\n#### 16"
