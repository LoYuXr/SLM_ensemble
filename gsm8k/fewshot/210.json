    "question": "Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes cost $20. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?",
    "completion": "To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate her total earnings from babysitting and mowing the lawn, and then determine how much more money she needs to save.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Sara's total earnings from babysitting:\n- She babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times.\n- Each babysitting session earns her $5.\n- Therefore, her total earnings from babysitting are \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate her total earnings from mowing the lawn:\n- She mows the lawn 4 times.\n- Each lawn mowing session earns her $4.\n- Therefore, her total earnings from mowing the lawn are \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) dollars.\n\nNow, let's find out how much money Sara has saved before she started babysitting:\n- She already had $10 saved.\n\nTo find out how much more money she needs to save, we subtract her total earnings from babysitting and mowing the lawn from her savings:\n- Total earnings from babysitting and mowing the lawn: $20 + $16 = $36.\n- Savings: $10.\n- Additional savings needed: $36 - $10 = $26.\n\nSince Sara earns $4 per lawn mowing session, we need to determine how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the additional $26:\n- Number of lawn mowing sessions needed: \\( \\frac{26}{4} = 6.5 \\).\n\nSince Sara cannot mow the lawn a fraction of a time, she needs to mow the lawn 7 times to earn the additional $26.\n\nTherefore, the number of times Sara must mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
    "answer": "Both pairs of shoes will cost a total of 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.\nSara will need to save a total of $30 + $40 = $<<30+40=70>>70 to buy everything that she wants.\nSara has earned 4 * $5 = $<<4*5=20>>20 from babysitting.\nBetween her savings and the babysitting, Sara has already saved $10 + $20 = $<<10+20=30>>30.\nSara needs to earn an additional $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 from mowing the lawn to afford her clothes.\nSara must mow the lawn $40 / $4 = <<40/4=10>>10 times to afford to buy the jacket and shoes.\n#### 10"
