    "question": "Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches. Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, and Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches. How many sandwiches are left?",
    "completion": "To determine how many sandwiches are left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of sandwiches Cody ate.\n2. Calculate the number of sandwiches Trevor ate.\n3. Subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor from the original number of sandwiches.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of sandwiches Cody ate} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of sandwiches Trevor ate} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor to find the total number of sandwiches eaten:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of sandwiches eaten} = 4 + 3 = 7\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches to find out how many are left:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of sandwiches left} = 12 - 7 = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of sandwiches left is \\boxed{5}.",
    "answer": "Cody ate 12/3=<<12/3=4>>4 sandwiches.\nTrevor ate 12/4=<<12/4=3>>3 sandwiches.\nCody and Trevor ate 4+3=<<4+3=7>>7 sandwiches.\nThere are 12-7=<<12-7=5>>5 sandwiches left\n#### 5"
