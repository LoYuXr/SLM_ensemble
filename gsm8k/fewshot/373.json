    "question": "A company bought $400000 worth of equipment from a retailer business, but pieces of equipment worth 40% of the total number were faulty. If they returned the faulty pieces of equipment to the seller, calculate the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment.",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment.\n2. Determine the number of functioning pieces of equipment.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment.**\n\nThe total amount of equipment bought is $400,000. The faulty pieces are 40% of the total number of pieces. Let's denote the total number of pieces as \\( N \\). Therefore, the number of faulty pieces is:\n\\[ \\text{Number of faulty pieces} = 0.40 \\times N \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of functioning pieces of equipment.**\n\nThe number of functioning pieces is the total number of pieces minus the number of faulty pieces:\n\\[ \\text{Number of functioning pieces} = N - \\text{Number of faulty pieces} = N - 0.40 \\times N = 0.60 \\times N \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment.**\n\nThe cost of each functioning piece is the total amount of equipment divided by the number of functioning pieces:\n\\[ \\text{Cost per functioning piece} = \\frac{400,000}{0.60 \\times N} \\]\n\nSince the cost per functioning piece is the same for all pieces, the total cost of the functioning pieces is:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost of functioning pieces} = 400,000 \\times \\frac{400,000}{0.60 \\times N} = 400,000 \\times \\frac{400,000}{0.60N} = \\frac{400,000^2}{0.60N} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{400,000^2}{0.60N}} \\]",
    "answer": "If 40% worth of the pieces of equipment bought were faulty and were returned, the amount of money they were bought for is 40/100*$400000 = $<<40/100*400000=160000>>160000\nSince the faulty pieces of equipment were worth $400000, the functioning equipment was worth $400000-$160000 = $<<400000-160000=240000>>240000\n#### 240000"
