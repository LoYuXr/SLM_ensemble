    "question": "In a race with 240 Asians, 80 were Japanese, and the rest were Chinese. If the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60, how many girls were on the Chinese team?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of girls on the Chinese team, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of Chinese team members:**\n   - The total number of Asians is 240.\n   - The number of Japanese team members is 80.\n   - Therefore, the number of Chinese team members is:\n     \\[\n     240 - 80 = 160\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of boys on the Chinese team:**\n   - The number of boys on the Chinese team is given as 60.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of girls on the Chinese team:**\n   - The total number of Chinese team members is 160.\n   - The number of boys on the Chinese team is 60.\n   - Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:\n     \\[\n     160 - 60 = 100\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of girls on the Chinese team is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
    "answer": "If there were 80 Japanese, the number of Chinese was 240-80=<<240-80=160>>160.\nSince there were 60 boys in the Chinese team, there were 160-60 = 100 girls in the Chinese team.\n#### 100"
