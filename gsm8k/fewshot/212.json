    "question": "Gary likes to walk around the edge of the local park, which is a rectangle that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles. If he walks at 3 miles/hour, how many hours does he spend walking?",
    "completion": "To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the perimeter of the park:**\n   The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given dimensions:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (1.5 \\text{ miles} + 6 \\text{ miles}) = 2 \\times 7.5 \\text{ miles} = 15 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the time Gary spends walking:**\n   Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time \\( t \\) it takes to walk 15 miles, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the distance and speed:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{15 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Gary spends \\(\\boxed{5}\\) hours walking around the edge of the park.",
    "answer": "First find the length of the two long sides of the park: 6 miles * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 miles\nThen find the length of the two short sides of the park: 1.5 miles * 2 = <<1.5*2=3>>3 miles\nThen add those two lengthes to find the total distance around the park: 12 miles + 3 miles = <<12+3=15>>15 miles\nThen divide the total length by Gary's speed to find how long he spends walking: 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = <<15/3=5>>5 hours\n#### 5"
