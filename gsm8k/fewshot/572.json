    "question": "Ford owns a garden and he grows 40 roses every week. He supplies Roses to the local flower shops. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. How many roses does Ford lack to supply all the flower shops every month?",
    "completion": "To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the first three flower shops per week.\n2. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the first three flower shops per month.\n3. Determine the total number of roses Ford needs to supply to all three flower shops per month.\n4. Find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week.\n2. The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week.\n3. The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week.\n\nThe total number of roses supplied per week by Ford to the first three flower shops is:\n\\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \\text{ roses per week} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of roses supplied per month by Ford to the first three flower shops:\n\\[ 65 \\text{ roses/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 260 \\text{ roses per month} \\]\n\nNow, we determine the total number of roses Ford needs to supply to all three flower shops per month:\n\\[ 260 \\text{ roses/month} \\]\n\nFinally, we find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month:\n\\[ 260 \\text{ roses/month} - 40 \\text{ roses/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 260 \\text{ roses/month} - 160 \\text{ roses/month} = 100 \\text{ roses/month} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]",
    "answer": "The first flower shop needs 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 roses every month.\nThe second flower shop needs 15 x 4= <<15*4=60>>60 roses every month.\nThe third flower shop needs 30 x 4 = <<30*4=120>>120 roses every month.\nSo the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.\nThe total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160\nTherefore, the total number of roses he lacks is 260 - 160 = <<260-160=100>>100 to supply all the flower shops every month.\n#### 100"
