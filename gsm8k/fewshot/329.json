    "question": "Erin has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives Erin another 10 lollipops. If Erin gives 3 of her lollipops to Ella, how many lollipops does she have left?",
    "completion": "Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she now has:\n\n\\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \\text{ lollipops} \\]\n\nIf Erin gives 3 of her lollipops to Ella, the number of lollipops she has left is:\n\n\\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \\text{ lollipops} \\]\n\nSo, Erin has 14 lollipops left.",
    "answer": "Erin has 7 + 10 = <<7+10=17>>17 lollipops\nAfter she gives 3 lollipops to Ella she has 17 - 3 = <<17-3=14>>14 lollipops.\n#### 14"
