    "question": "Hannah slips on a banana peel and breaks her arm. The doctor charges her $200 for the cast, $300/hour for a 30-minute visit, $4/pill for 30 painkillers, and $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking. How much does the doctor's visit cost total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to break down the expenses into their respective components and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Cost of the cast:**\n   The cast costs $200.\n\n2. **Cost of the visit:**\n   - The visit is 30 minutes long, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours.\n   - The visit costs $300/hour.\n   - Therefore, the cost of the visit is:\n     \\[\n     300 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours} = 150 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Cost of the painkillers:**\n   The doctor charges $4 per pill.\n   - The patient needs 30 painkillers.\n   - Therefore, the cost of the painkillers is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ dollars/pill} \\times 30 \\text{ pills} = 120 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Cost of the parking:**\n   The parking is mandatory and costs $6 per hour.\n   - The patient needs 2 hours of parking.\n   - Therefore, the cost of the parking is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 12 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nNow, we sum up all the costs:\n\\[\n200 \\text{ dollars (cast)} + 150 \\text{ dollars (visit)} + 120 \\text{ dollars (painkillers)} + 12 \\text{ dollars (parking)} = 582 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost of the doctor's visit is \\(\\boxed{582}\\).",
    "answer": "First find the length of the visit in hours: 30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = <<30/60=.5>>.5 hours\nThen find the total cost of the visit: $300/hour * .5 hours = $<<300*.5=150>>150\nThen find the total cost of the painkillers: $4/pill * 30 pills = $<<4*30=120>>120\nThen find the cost of the parking: $6/hour * 2 hours = $<<6*2=12>>12\nThen add all the different costs to find the total cost: $12 + $120 + $150 + $200 = $<<12+120+150+200=482>>482\n#### 482"
