    "question": "Rani is obsessed with sports cars. She wonders what the faster car ever made can go so she looks it up. What she finds out is that the fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car. The average car can go 120 Miles per hour. How fast does the faster car go?",
    "completion": "To determine the speed of the faster car, we need to work through the information step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the speed of the average car:**\n   The average car can go 120 miles per hour.\n\n2. **Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**\n   The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed of the 2nd fastest car} = 5 \\times 120 = 600 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the speed of the fastest car:**\n   The fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed of the fastest car} = 1.25 \\times 600 = 750 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the faster car goes \\(\\boxed{750}\\) miles per hour.",
    "answer": "The 2nd fastest car can go 600 MPH because 5 x 120 = <<5*120=600>>600\nThe faster car can go 750 MPH because 1.25 x 600 = <<1.25*600=750>>750\n#### 750"
