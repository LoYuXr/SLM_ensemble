    "question": "On Tuesday, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. On Sunday he exercised for 23 minutes. On Monday he exercised for 16 minutes. How many minutes does he have to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal?",
    "completion": "To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.\n2. Determine how much more time he needs to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal.\n\nFirst, let's find the total amount of time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined:\n- Peter exercised on Monday for 16 minutes.\n- Peter exercised on Sunday for 23 minutes.\n- Therefore, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is \\(16 + 23 = 39\\) minutes.\n\nNext, let's determine how much more time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal of 100 minutes:\n- Peter's goal is 100 minutes.\n- He has already exercised for 39 minutes on Monday and Sunday combined.\n- Therefore, the additional time he needs to exercise on Tuesday is \\(100 - 39 = 61\\) minutes.\n\nSo, Peter needs to exercise for \\(\\boxed{61}\\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.",
    "answer": "On Sunday and Monday he exercised a total of 39 minutes because 23 + 16 = <<23+16=39>>39\nOn Tuesday he has to exercise for 78 minutes because 39 x 2 = <<39*2=78>>78\n#### 78"
