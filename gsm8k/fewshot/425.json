    "question": "Lillian's garden doesn't have any bird feeders in it so she wants to add some. She builds 3 and buys 3 others. Each bird feeder seems to attract 20 birds throughout the day until Lillian notices that the birds seem to prefer the feeders she made herself which attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. How many birds can Lillian expect to see in her garden each day if the same amount keep coming to her bird feeders?",
    "completion": "To determine how many birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of bird feeders:**\n   Lillian initially built 3 bird feeders and bought 3 more.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of bird feeders} = 3 + 3 = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of birds attracted by the bird feeders:**\n   Each bird feeder attracts 20 birds.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of birds attracted} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of birds attracted by the bird feeders she made herself:**\n   The bird feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Birds attracted by store-bought feeders} = 20 + 10 = 30\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by all the bird feeders:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of birds attracted} = 120 + 30 = 150\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:**\n   Since the same amount of birds come to her bird feeders each day, the total number of birds attracted by all the feeders is the same as the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of birds expected} = 150\n   \\]\n\nThus, Lillian can expect to see \\(\\boxed{150}\\) birds in her garden each day.",
    "answer": "Lillian has 3 store-bought + 3 self-made bird feeders = <<3+3=6>>6 bird feeders in all.\nLillian first notices each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, 6 x 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 birds.\nThen Lillian notices that her 3 self-made bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 extra birds.\nEach day Lillian can expect to see 120 + 30 = <<120+30=150>>150 birds in her garden.\n#### 150"
