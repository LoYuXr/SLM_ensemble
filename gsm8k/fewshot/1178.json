    "question": "Mike bought 5 face masks while Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. How many face masks did Johnny buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how many face masks Johnny bought, we start by defining the number of face masks Mike bought. According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.\n\nNext, we need to express the number of face masks Johnny bought in terms of Mike's purchase. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many face masks as Mike. We can express this mathematically as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of face masks Johnny bought} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of face masks Mike bought} + 2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the number of face masks Mike bought into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of face masks Johnny bought} = 3 \\times 5 + 2\n\\]\n\nNow, we perform the multiplication and addition:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 5 = 15\n\\]\n\n\\[\n15 + 2 = 17\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Johnny bought \\boxed{17} face masks.",
    "answer": "Thrice as many as Mike's face masks is 5 x 3 = <<5*3=15>>15.\nSo, Johnny bought 15 + 2 = <<15+2=17>>17 face masks.\n#### 17"
