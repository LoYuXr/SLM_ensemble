    "question": "On a particular week, a tow truck pulled ten cars for each of the first three days and then four fewer cars on each of the remaining days of the week. Calculate the total number of cars it towed that week.",
    "completion": "To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck for the week, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the number of cars towed on the first three days and the number of cars towed on the remaining days.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days:**\n   - The number of cars towed each day for the first three days is 10.\n   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\text{ cars/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 30 \\text{ cars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining days:**\n   - The number of cars towed each day for the remaining days is 10 - 4 = 6.\n   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\text{ cars/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days} = 24 \\text{ cars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of cars towed for the entire week:**\n   - Add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining days:\n     \\[\n     30 \\text{ cars} + 24 \\text{ cars} = 54 \\text{ cars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of cars towed that week is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
    "answer": "On the first three days, towing ten cars a day, the tow truck pulled 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 cars.\nIt pulled four fewer cars each day, which is 10-4 = <<10-4=6>>6 cars on the remaining days.\nIf it pulled ten cars for three days and four less on the remaining days, then it pulled for 7-3 = 4 days, four cars less each day.\nFor the four days, the car pulled 6*4= <<6*4=24>>24 cars.\nThe total number of cars it pulled that week is 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 cars.\n#### 54"
