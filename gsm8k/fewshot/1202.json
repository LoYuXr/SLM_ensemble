    "question": "Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each and three makeup sets that came with six eyeshadow colors each. Her sister steals one of the palettes. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. How many eyeshadow colors does she have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had.\n2. Determine how many colors she uses up from one makeup set.\n3. Subtract the number of colors used from the total number of colors to find out how many colors she has left.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had:\n- Amy has two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors.\n- Amy has three makeup sets, each with six colors.\n\nSo, the total number of colors is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 + 3 \\times 6 = 8 + 18 = 26 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many colors Amy uses up from one makeup set. According to the problem, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has six colors, half of six is:\n\\[ \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of colors used from the total number of colors to find out how many colors Amy has left:\n\\[ 26 - 3 = 23 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{23} \\]",
    "answer": "Amy had 2 * 4 + 3 * 6 = 8 + 18 = <<2*4+3*6=26>>26 eyeshadow colors to start.\nHer sister stole one palette of 4 colors, leaving Amy with 26 - 4 = <<26-4=22>>22 colors.\nHalf the colors from one makeup set are 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 colors.\nThus, Amy has 22 - 3 = <<22-3=19>>19 eyeshadow colors left.\n#### 19"
