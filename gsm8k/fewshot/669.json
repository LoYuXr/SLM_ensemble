    "question": "For every muffin, Svetlana needed 5 tablespoons of flour, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 0.25 of a tablespoon of salt. How many tablespoons of dry ingredients would Svetlana need to make 16 muffins?",
    "completion": "To determine how many tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need to make 16 muffins, we first need to calculate the total amount of dry ingredients required for one muffin and then multiply that by 16.\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of dry ingredients needed for one muffin:\n   - Svetlana needs 5 tablespoons of flour.\n   - Svetlana needs 3 tablespoons of sugar.\n   - Svetlana needs 0.25 tablespoons of salt.\n   - Therefore, the total amount of dry ingredients needed for one muffin is \\(5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25\\) tablespoons.\n\n2. Calculate the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins:\n   - Since each muffin requires 8.25 tablespoons of dry ingredients, for 16 muffins, the total amount of dry ingredients needed is \\(16 \\times 8.25 = 132\\) tablespoons.\n\nThus, Svetlana would need \\(\\boxed{132}\\) tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.",
    "answer": "5 + 3 + 0.25 = <<5+3+0.25=8.25>>8.25 tablespoons\n16 * 8.25 = <<16*8.25=132>>132 tablespoons\nSvetlana needed 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.\n#### 132"
