    "question": "Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons with his mighty sword, while Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.  Using a rusty iron axe, Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.  But Prince Bruce, having forgot his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file.  How many Dragons has Prince Bruce slain?",
    "completion": "To determine how many dragons Prince Bruce has slain, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of dragons slain by each prince step by step.\n\n1. **Prince Thaddeus**: He slew 100 dragons with his mighty sword.\n2. **Prince Arthur**: He slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Therefore, Prince Arthur slew:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} \\times 100 = 75 \\text{ dragons}\n   \\]\n3. **Prince Walter**: He slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, Prince Walter slew:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 75 = 150 \\text{ dragons}\n   \\]\n4. **Prince Bruce**: He slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Therefore, Prince Bruce slew:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5} \\times 150 = 30 \\text{ dragons}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Prince Bruce has slain \\(\\boxed{30}\\) dragons.",
    "answer": "Prince Arthur slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, or 100*(3/4)=<<100*(3/4)=75>>75 dragons.\nPrince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, or 2*75=<<2*75=150>>150 dragons.\nPrince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, or 150/5=<<150/5=30>>30 dragons.\n#### 30"
