    "question": "A farmer is baling hay in their field. Each hour the farmer makes 5 bales. At the same time, a truck is picking the hay bales up. Each hour the truck picks up 3 bales of hay. If the farmer and the truck driver put in a 6 hour day, how many bales of hay are left in the field?",
    "completion": "To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after 6 hours, we need to calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer and the truck over that period.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of bales produced by the farmer in 6 hours:\n- The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.\n- Over 6 hours, the farmer will make \\(5 \\text{ bales/hour} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ bales}\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of bales produced by the truck in 6 hours:\n- The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.\n- Over 6 hours, the truck will pick up \\(3 \\text{ bales/hour} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 18 \\text{ bales}\\).\n\nNow, we add the number of bales produced by the farmer and the truck to find the total number of bales left in the field:\n- Total bales = bales produced by the farmer + bales picked up by the truck\n- Total bales = \\(30 \\text{ bales} + 18 \\text{ bales} = 48 \\text{ bales}\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is \\(\\boxed{48}\\).",
    "answer": "The farmer makes 5*6= <<5*6=30>>30 bales of hay.\nThe truck takes away 3*6= <<3*6=18>>18 bales of hay.\nThere are 30-18= <<30-18=12>>12 bales of hay left in the field.\n#### 12"
