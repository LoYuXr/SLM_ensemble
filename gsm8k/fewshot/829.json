    "question": "Boris owns a chocolate factory. He produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. The second week, Boris only produces half as much as the first week. But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. How much does he produce the fourth week?",
    "completion": "To determine how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to follow the production pattern step by step.\n\n1. **First Week Production:**\n   Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.\n\n2. **Second Week Production:**\n   Boris produces half as much as the first week.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Second Week Production} = \\frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \\text{ bars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Week Production:**\n   Boris produces three times as much as the first week.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Third Week Production} = 3 \\times 8,000 = 24,000 \\text{ bars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fourth Week Production:**\n   To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to add the production from the third week to the production from the first week.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fourth Week Production} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \\text{ bars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Boris produces \\(\\boxed{36,000}\\) bars of chocolate in the fourth week.",
    "answer": "In the second week, Boris produces 8,000/2 = <<8000/2=4000>>4,000 bars of chocolate.\nIn the third week, Boris produces 8,000*3 = <<8000*3=24000>>24,000 bars of chocolate.\nIn the first three weeks, Boris produces 8,000+4,000+24,000 = <<8000+4000+24000=36000>>36,000 bars of chocolate\nIn the fourth week, Boris produces 50,000-36,000 = <<50000-36000=14000>>14,000 bars of chocolate.\n#### 14,000"
