    "question": "John collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes.  The first two have 200 apartments each and the last one is 60% bigger than the other two combined.  He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment.  How much money does he make in a week?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.\n2. Determine the number of apartments in the last complex.\n3. Calculate the total number of apartments John collects in a week.\n4. Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.**\n\nEach of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.\n\\[ 200 \\text{ apartments/complex} \\times 2 \\text{ complexes} = 400 \\text{ apartments} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of apartments in the last complex.**\n\nThe last complex is 60% bigger than the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes.\n\\[ 400 \\text{ apartments} \\times 1.60 = 640 \\text{ apartments} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of apartments John collects in a week.**\n\nJohn collects garbage 3 times a week from each of the three complexes.\n\\[ 3 \\text{ collections/week} \\times 3 \\text{ complexes} = 9 \\text{ collections/week} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.**\n\nJohn gets paid $0.40 per collection.\n\\[ 9 \\text{ collections/week} \\times 0.40 \\text{ dollars/collection} = 3.60 \\text{ dollars/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money John makes in a week is \\(\\boxed{3.60}\\).",
    "answer": "The first two complexes have 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 apartments\nThe third one has 400*.6=<<400*.6=240>>240 more apartments than those 2 combined\nSo in total, it has 400+240=<<400+240=640>>640 apartments\nSo he goes to 640+400=<<640+400=1040>>1040 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 1040*3=<<1040*3=3120>>3120 apartments every week\nSo he makes 3120*$0.4=$<<3120*0.4=1248>>1248 every week\n#### 1248"
