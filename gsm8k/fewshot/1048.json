    "question": "Ben bought a car for $20000 in 2007. The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. Find the price of the car in the year 2010.",
    "completion": "To determine the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to account for the annual depreciation rate of 21% per year. We start with the initial price of the car in 2007, which is $20,000.\n\nThe formula for the price of the car after \\( n \\) years, given an annual depreciation rate \\( r \\), is:\n\\[ P = P_0 \\times (1 - r)^n \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( P \\) is the price after \\( n \\) years,\n- \\( P_0 \\) is the initial price,\n- \\( r \\) is the annual depreciation rate,\n- \\( n \\) is the number of years.\n\nIn this problem:\n- \\( P_0 = 20000 \\) dollars,\n- \\( r = 0.21 \\) (21% expressed as a decimal),\n- \\( n = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \\) years.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\\[ P = 20000 \\times (1 - 0.21)^3 \\]\n\\[ P = 20000 \\times (0.79)^3 \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate \\( (0.79)^3 \\):\n\\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \\times 0.79 \\times 0.79 \\approx 0.491321 \\]\n\nSo, the price of the car in the year 2010 is:\n\\[ P = 20000 \\times 0.491321 \\approx 9826.42 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9826.42.",
    "answer": "The price of the car depreciates of 20000 * 21% = $<<20000*21*.01=4200>>4200 per year.\nBen had the car for 2010 - 2007 = <<2010-2007=3>>3 years.\nThe price of the car depreciates 4200 * 3 = $<<4200*3=12600>>12600 from 2007 to 2010.\nSo the price of the car in the year 2010 is $20000 - $12600 = $<<20000-12600=7400>>7400.\n#### 7400"
