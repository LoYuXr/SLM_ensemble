    "question": "A plague infects ten people. Every day, each infected person infects six others. How many people are infected after three days?",
    "completion": "To determine how many people are infected after three days, we need to follow the process step by step.\n\nInitially, there are 10 people infected. Each infected person infects 6 others, so after the first day, the number of new infections is \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\). Therefore, the number of people infected after the first day is \\(10 + 60 = 70\\).\n\nOn the second day, each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \\(70 \\times 6 = 420\\). Therefore, the number of people infected after the second day is \\(70 + 420 = 490\\).\n\nOn the third day, each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \\(490 \\times 6 = 2940\\). Therefore, the number of people infected after the third day is \\(490 + 2940 = 3430\\).\n\nThus, the number of people infected after three days is \\(\\boxed{3430}\\).",
    "answer": "On the first day, the original ten people infect six people each, so 10 * 6 = <<10*6=60>>60 more people are infected.\nThere are 10 + 60 = <<10+60=70>>70 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 70 * 6 = <<70*6=420>>420 more people are infected.\nThere are 70 + 420 = <<70+420=490>>490 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 490 * 6 = 2940 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 490 + 2940 = 3430 infected people after three days.\n#### 3430"
