    "question": "It rained 2 inches on Monday and is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday\u2019s total on Tuesday. How many inches of rain will there be on Tuesday?",
    "completion": "To determine the amount of rain expected on Tuesday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the amount of rain on Monday.\n2. Calculate the amount of rain on Tuesday based on the given information.\n\nFirst, we know that the amount of rain on Monday is 2 inches. According to the problem, the amount of rain on Tuesday is expected to be 1 more inch than twice the amount of rain on Monday. We can express this mathematically as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rain on Tuesday} = 2 \\times \\text{Rain on Monday} + 1 \\]\n\nSubstituting the amount of rain on Monday into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rain on Tuesday} = 2 \\times 2 + 1 \\]\n\nNow, we perform the multiplication and addition:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rain on Tuesday} = 4 + 1 = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of rain expected on Tuesday is \\(\\boxed{5}\\) inches.",
    "answer": "Twice as much rain as Monday is 2 inches * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 inches\nIt will rain 1 more inch than this value on Tuesday so 4 inches + 1 = <<4+1=5>>5 inches on Tuesday\n#### 5"
