    "question": "Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, how many does Sally have?",
    "completion": "To determine how many books Sally has, we start by defining the number of books Sally has as \\( S \\). According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Janey's books} = 2S + 3 \\]\n\nWe know that Janey has 21 books, so we can substitute 21 for Janey's books in the equation:\n\n\\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve for \\( S \\). First, we isolate the term with \\( S \\) by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \\]\n\\[ 18 = 2S \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( S \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{18}{2} \\]\n\\[ S = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, Sally has \\(\\boxed{9}\\) books.",
    "answer": "Let x be the number of books that Sally has\nJaney has 3+2x books\n3+2x=21\n2x=18\nx=<<9=9>>9\n#### 9"
