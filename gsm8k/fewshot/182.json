    "question": "Jean is two years older than Mark.  Two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.  If Jan is 30 how old is Jean?",
    "completion": "To determine Jean's age, we need to follow the information given step by step.\n\n1. **Identify Jan's current age:**\n   Jan is 30 years old.\n\n2. **Determine Mark's current age:**\n   Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{30}{2} + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, Mark is currently:\n   \\[\n   30 - 2 = 28\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine Jean's current age:**\n   Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's age is:\n   \\[\n   28 + 2 = 30\n   \\]\n\nThus, Jean is \\(\\boxed{30}\\) years old.",
    "answer": "2 years ago Jan was 30-2=<<30-2=28>>28 years old\nSo Marks age two years ago was 5+28/2=<<5+28/2=19>>19 years old\nMark is now 19+2=<<19+2=21>>21 years old\nSo Jean is 21+2=<<21+2=23>>23 years old\n#### 23"
