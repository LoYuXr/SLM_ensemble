    "question": "The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays, 125 chimichangas on Wednesdays and twice as many on Friday. How many chimichangas do they make on those three days?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop over the three days, we need to calculate the number of chimichangas made each day and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Tuesday**: The shop makes 125 chimichangas.\n2. **Wednesday**: The shop makes 125 chimichangas.\n3. **Friday**: The shop makes twice as many chimichangas as it did on Wednesday. Since it made 125 chimichangas on Wednesday, it makes \\(2 \\times 125 = 250\\) chimichangas on Friday.\n\nNow, we sum the number of chimichangas made each day:\n\\[ 125 \\text{ (Tuesday)} + 125 \\text{ (Wednesday)} + 250 \\text{ (Friday)} = 500 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of chimichangas made by the shop over the three days is \\(\\boxed{500}\\).",
    "answer": "125*2 = <<125*2=250>>250 chimichangas are made on Friday.\nIn those three days 125+125+250 = <<125+125+250=500>>500 chimichangas are made.\n#### 500"
