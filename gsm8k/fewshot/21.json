    "question": "Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. If Samantha is now 31, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?",
    "completion": "To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Samantha's current age:**\n   Samantha is currently 31 years old.\n\n2. **Determine Raymond's current age:**\n   Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Therefore, Raymond is currently:\n   \\[\n   31 - 6 = 25 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the age of Raymond's son:**\n   Raymond has a son at the age of 23. Therefore, the son is currently:\n   \\[\n   23 - 23 = 0 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the age difference between Raymond's son and Samantha's son:**\n   The son is currently 0 years old, and Samantha is 31 years old. The age difference between them is:\n   \\[\n   31 - 0 = 31 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine how many years ago the son was born:**\n   Since the son is currently 0 years old, he was born 31 years ago.\n\nThus, Raymond's son was born \\(\\boxed{31}\\) years ago.",
    "answer": "When Raymond's son was born Samantha was 23 - 6 = <<23-6=17>>17 years old.\nThus it has been 31 - 17 = <<31-17=14>>14 years since Raymond's son was born.\n#### 14"
