    "question": "James has 6 more candies than Robert. John has twice as many candies as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more candies John has than James, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of candies Robert has:**\n   Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of candies John has} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of candies Robert has}\n   \\]\n   Let \\( R \\) represent the number of candies Robert has. Then:\n   \\[\n   54 = 2R\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( R \\):\n   \\[\n   R = \\frac{54}{2} = 27\n   \\]\n   So, Robert has 27 candies.\n\n2. **Determine the number of candies James has:**\n   James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, we can calculate the number of candies James has as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of candies James has} = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33\n   \\]\n   So, James has 33 candies.\n\n3. **Calculate how many more candies John has than James:**\n   To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = \\text{Number of candies John has} - \\text{Number of candies James has} = 54 - 33 = 21\n   \\]\n\nThus, John has \\(\\boxed{21}\\) more candies than James.",
    "answer": "Robert has 54/2 = <<54/2=27>>27 candies.\nJames has 27+6 = <<27+6=33>>33 candies.\nJohn has 54-33= <<54-33=21>>21 more candies than James.\n#### 21"
