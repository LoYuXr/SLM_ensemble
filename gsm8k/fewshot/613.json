    "question": "A Reddit group has 1000 members. If each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, what's the total number of posts that the group will have in March?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of days in March:**\n   March has 31 days.\n\n2. **Determine the number of posts each member posts per day:**\n   Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of posts for all members in one day:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total posts per day} = \\text{Number of members} \\times \\text{Posts per member per day}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total posts per day} = 1000 \\times 3 = 3000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of posts for all members in March:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total posts in March} = \\text{Total posts per day} \\times \\text{Number of days in March}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total posts in March} = 3000 \\times 31 = 93000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of posts in March is \\(\\boxed{93000}\\).",
    "answer": "The total number of posts from all members in a day is 1000 members * 3 posts/member = <<1000*3=3000>>3000 posts.\nMarch has 31 days, so the total number of posts will be 31 days * 3000 posts/day = <<31*3000=93000>>93000 posts\n#### 93000"
