    "question": "To kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.  They fill up 10 packs of balloons that have 30 balloons per pack.  By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left.  How many balloons did they throw?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of balloons Jolene and her friends threw, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of balloons initially filled.\n2. Subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons initially filled.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of balloons initially filled. Jolene has 10 packs of balloons, and each pack contains 30 balloons. So, the total number of balloons is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ packs} \\times 30 \\text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \\text{ balloons} \\]\n\nNext, we know that by the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left. To find out how many balloons were thrown away, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons initially filled:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ balloons} - 12 \\text{ balloons} = 288 \\text{ balloons} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of balloons thrown away is:\n\\[ \\boxed{288} \\]",
    "answer": "They started off with 10 packs of balloons that had 30 balloons each for a total of 10*30 = <<10*30=300>>300 balloons\nThey started with 300 balloons and had 12 left which means they threw 300-12 = <<300-12=288>>288 balloons\n#### 288"
