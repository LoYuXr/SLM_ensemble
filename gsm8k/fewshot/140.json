    "question": "Of the 20 available cars for rent, 12 are automatic cars, 4 are manual cars, and the rest are semi-automatic. What percentage of the cars are semi-automatic?",
    "completion": "To determine the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cars:**\n   - Total cars = 20\n\n2. **Determine the number of semi-automatic cars:**\n   - Number of automatic cars = 12\n   - Number of manual cars = 4\n   - Number of semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)\n   - Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)\n   - Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16\n   - Number of semi-automatic cars = 4\n\n3. **Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:**\n   - Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100\n   - Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100\n   - Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100\n   - Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is \\boxed{20}.",
    "answer": "12 + 4 = <<12+4=16>>16 cars are either automatic or manual.\nSo, 20 - 16 = <<20-16=4>>4 cars are semi-automatic.\nTherefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 4/20 x 100% = 20%.\n#### 20"
