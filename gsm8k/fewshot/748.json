    "question": "Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. If Sean has 56 marbles, how many marbles do Carl and Cal have combined?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of marbles Sean has.\n2. Use the information about Sean's marbles to find the number of marbles Carl has.\n3. Use the information about Carl's marbles to find the number of marbles Cal has.\n4. Add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have together.\n\nStep 1: Sean has 56 marbles.\nStep 2: Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find the number of marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2.\n\\[ \\text{Cal's marbles} = 2 \\times 56 = 112 \\]\n\nStep 3: Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, we can find the number of marbles Carl has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 4.\n\\[ \\text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \\times 56 = 224 \\]\n\nStep 4: To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have together, we add the number of marbles Carl has to the number of marbles Cal has.\n\\[ \\text{Total marbles} = \\text{Carl's marbles} + \\text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined is \\(\\boxed{336}\\).",
    "answer": "Cal has 56*2 = <<56*2=112>>112 marbles.\nCarl has 4*56 = <<4*56=224>>224 marbles.\nCarl and Cal have 112+224 = <<112+224=336>>336 marbles combined.\n#### 336"
