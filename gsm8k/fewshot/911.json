    "question": "Colby works for a manufacturing company in the packaging division.  He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. If he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, how much money, in dollars, does he earn in a typical eight-hour workday?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of packages Colby completes in an hour:**\n   Colby completes 10 packages less than 50 packages per hour. Therefore, the number of packages he completes in one hour is:\n   \\[\n   50 - 10 = 40 \\text{ packages per hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of packages Colby completes in an eight-hour workday:**\n   Since he completes 40 packages per hour, in an eight-hour workday he completes:\n   \\[\n   40 \\text{ packages/hour} \\times 8 \\text{ hours} = 320 \\text{ packages}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total earnings:**\n   Colby earns $0.20 for each package he completes. Therefore, his total earnings for the eight-hour workday are:\n   \\[\n   320 \\text{ packages} \\times 0.20 \\text{ dollars/package} = 64 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Colby earns \\(\\boxed{64}\\) dollars in a typical eight-hour workday.",
    "answer": "Ten less than fifty is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 packages per hour.\nAt $0.20 per completed package. if he completes 40 packages per hour he earns 40*$0.20=$<<40*0.20=8>>8 per hour.\nThus, in a typical eight-hour day, he earns 8*$8=$<<8*8=64>>64.\n#### 64"
