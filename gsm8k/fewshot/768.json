    "question": "In one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more. How many books have they read altogether?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of books Ezra read in one hour:**\n   - We know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of books Ezra read after reading 150 more:**\n   - Ezra read 300 books initially.\n   - He read 150 more books.\n   - Therefore, the total number of books Ezra read is:\n     \\[\n     300 + 150 = 450\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of books Ahmed read in one hour:**\n   - We know that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour.\n   - Let \\( A \\) be the number of books Ahmed read in one hour.\n   - According to the problem, \\( 450 = 2A \\).\n   - Solving for \\( A \\):\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{450}{2} = 225\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:**\n   - Ezra read 450 books.\n   - Ahmed read 225 books.\n   - Therefore, the total number of books read by both is:\n     \\[\n     450 + 225 = 675\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed is \\(\\boxed{675}\\).",
    "answer": "If Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more in the next hour, he has read a total of 300+150=<<300+150=450>>450\nSince Ezra reads twice as many books as Ahmed, Ahmed has read 450/2=<<450/2=225>>225 books.\nTogether, Ahmed and Ezra has read 225+450=<<225+450=675>>675 books\n#### 675"
