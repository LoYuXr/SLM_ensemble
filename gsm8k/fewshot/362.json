    "question": "Mark makes custom dog beds. A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing, a bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing, and a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between the first two kinds of beds. How many pounds of stuffing does Mark need to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds?",
    "completion": "To determine the total pounds of stuffing needed to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds, we need to calculate the amount of stuffing required for each type of bed and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of stuffing needed for one chihuahua bed:\n- A chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of stuffing needed for one collie bed:\n- A collie bed requires the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed, which is \\(\\frac{8 + 2}{2} = 5\\) pounds of stuffing.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total pounds of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ chihuahua beds} \\times 2 \\text{ pounds per chihuahua bed} = 8 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total pounds of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ collie beds} \\times 5 \\text{ pounds per collie bed} = 15 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the pounds of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ pounds} + 15 \\text{ pounds} = 23 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total pounds of stuffing needed is \\(\\boxed{23}\\).",
    "answer": "First, find the total amount of stuffing in one Rottweiler bed and one chihuahua bed: 2 pounds + 8 pounds = <<2+8=10>>10 pounds\nThen divide the total stuffing amount by 2 to find the average stuffing amount: 10 pounds / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 pounds\nThen find the amount of stuffing in 4 chihuahua beds: 2 pounds/bed * 4 beds = <<2*4=8>>8 pounds\nThen find the amount of stuffing in 3 collie beds: 5 pounds/bed * 3 beds = <<5*3=15>>15 pounds\nThen add the two amounts of stuffing to find the total amount of stuffing needed: 8 pounds + 15 pounds = <<8+15=23>>23 pounds\n#### 23"
