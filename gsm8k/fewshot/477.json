    "question": "Nine of the kids in Gina's class are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts and 3 are allergic to both. If there are 32 kids in her class, how many aren't allergic to anything?",
    "completion": "To determine how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the following:\n\n- \\( A \\) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.\n- \\( B \\) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.\n- \\( |A| \\) as the number of kids allergic to dairy.\n- \\( |B| \\) as the number of kids allergic to peanuts.\n- \\( |A \\cap B| \\) as the number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts.\n- \\( |A \\cup B| \\) as the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n- \\( |A| = 6 \\)\n- \\( |B| = 3 \\)\n- \\( |A \\cap B| = 3 \\)\n- The total number of kids in the class is 32.\n\nWe need to find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, which is \\( |A \\cup B| \\). According to the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is given by:\n\\[ |A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B| \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values into the formula, we get:\n\\[ |A \\cup B| = 6 + 3 - 3 = 6 \\]\n\nThis means that 6 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:\n\\[ 32 - |A \\cup B| = 32 - 6 = 26 \\]\n\nSo, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is \\(\\boxed{26}\\).",
    "answer": "First subtract the number of kids who are allergic to each item from the total number of kids: 32 kids - 6 kids - 9 kids = <<32-6-9=17>>17 kids\nThen add the number of kids who were double-counted because they're allergic to both things: 17 kids + 3 kids = <<17+3=20>>20 kids\n#### 20"
