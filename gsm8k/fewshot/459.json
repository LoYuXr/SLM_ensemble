    "question": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and then divide that by the truck's capacity.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of the feed:\n\n1. **Hay**: 42 bales of hay at 75 pounds each.\n   \\[\n   42 \\text{ bales} \\times 75 \\text{ pounds/bale} = 3150 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Oats**: 20 sacks of oats at 65 pounds each.\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ sacks} \\times 65 \\text{ pounds/sack} = 1300 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Carrots**: 4 bags of carrots at 12 pounds each.\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ bags} \\times 12 \\text{ pounds/bag} = 48 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Sugar cubes**: 2 boxes of sugar cubes at 1 pound each.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ boxes} \\times 1 \\text{ pound/box} = 2 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's sum up the total weight of the feed:\n\\[\n3150 \\text{ pounds} + 1300 \\text{ pounds} + 48 \\text{ pounds} + 2 \\text{ pounds} = 4610 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed:\n\\[\n\\frac{4610 \\text{ pounds}}{2250 \\text{ pounds/trip}} \\approx 2.0888 \\text{ trips}\n\\]\n\nSince the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer needs to make 3 trips to transport all the feed.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.\nHe is buying 4 * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 pounds of carrots.\nHe is buying 42 * 75 = <<42*75=3150>>3150 pounds of hay bales.\nHe is buying 20 * 65 = <<20*65=1300>>1300 pounds of oat sacks.\nThe weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = <<2+48+3150+1300=4500>>4500 pounds.\nThus, the farmer needs 4500 / 2250 = <<4500/2250=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2"
