    "question": "Abraham owns 80 square meters of unused land. He sold half of the land for $50, and after a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. How much money will he be able to earn after selling all his unused land?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of land Abraham sold initially.\n2. Calculate the amount of land Abraham sold after the first sale.\n3. Calculate the amount of land Abraham sold after the second sale.\n4. Calculate the total amount of money Abraham earned from selling the land.\n\nFirst, we know that Abraham initially owns 80 square meters of land. He sold half of this land for $50. Therefore, the amount of land he sold initially is:\n\\[ \\frac{80}{2} = 40 \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nNext, after the first sale, Abraham sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Therefore, the amount of land he sold after the first sale is:\n\\[ \\frac{40}{4} = 10 \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nAfter the second sale, Abraham sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. Therefore, the total amount of money he earned from selling the land is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 3 = 90 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding the money earned from selling the land to the money earned from selling the initial land, we get:\n\\[ 50 + 90 = 140 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]",
    "answer": "Abraham sold 1/2 x 80= <<1/2*80=40>>40 square meters of his unused land.\nAfter a month, he sold 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 square meters of his land.\nSo, the total land he already sold is 40+10= <<50=50>>50 square meters of his land.\nHe has 80 - 50 = <<80-50=30>>30 remaining land to be sold at $3 per square meter.\nSo he earned $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90 for that land.\nTherefore, he earned a total of $50 + $30 + $90 = $<<50+30+90=170>>170.\n#### 170"
