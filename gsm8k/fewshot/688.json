    "question": "John is very tired. He decides to take a nap, but he wants to finish his homework first. If John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework and 3 hours before he has to eat dinner, how many minutes does John have to nap?",
    "completion": "To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has before he has to eat dinner and then subtract that from the total available time before he has to eat dinner.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time John has before he has to eat dinner:\n- Math homework: 20 minutes\n- Reading homework: 40 minutes\n- History homework: 20 minutes\n- Time before dinner: 3 hours\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we add up all the time before John has to eat dinner:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ minutes} + 40 \\text{ minutes} + 20 \\text{ minutes} + 180 \\text{ minutes} = 260 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nJohn has 20 minutes of homework left to finish. Therefore, the time he has to nap is:\n\\[ 260 \\text{ minutes} - 20 \\text{ minutes} = 240 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, John has to nap for \\(\\boxed{240}\\) minutes.",
    "answer": "John has to spend 20+40+20 = <<20+40+20=80>>80 minutes on homework.\nJohn has 3 hours*60 minutes= <<3*60=180>>180 minutes before dinner.\nThus, John has 180-80=<<180-80=100>>100 minutes for his nap.\n#### 100"
