    "question": "A food truck only sells grilled cheeses.  They source their bread for $3.00 a loaf and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.  If they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, what is their net profit?",
    "completion": "To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue from selling sandwiches and subtract the total cost of ingredients.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of sandwiches sold:\n- They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.\n- Total number of sandwiches sold = 10 sandwiches/sandwich * 10 sandwiches = 100 sandwiches.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the sandwiches:\n- They sell 100 sandwiches for $7.00 each.\n- Total revenue = 100 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $700.00.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of ingredients:\n- They source bread for $3.00 per loaf.\n- Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.\n- Total number of loaves needed = 100 sandwiches / 10 sandwiches/loaf = 10 loaves.\n- Total cost of ingredients = 10 loaves * $3.00/loaf = $30.00.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the net profit:\n- Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost of ingredients\n- Net profit = $700.00 - $30.00 = $670.00.\n\nSo, their net profit is $670.00.",
    "answer": "They spend $3.00 on bread and $30.00 on cheese and condiments for a total of 3+30 = $<<3+30=33.00>>33.00\nThey sell 10 sandwiches at $7.00 apiece for a total of 10*7 = $<<10*7=70.00>>70.00\nThey made $70.00 and spent $33.00 for a net profit of 70-33 = $<<70-33=37.00>>37.00 per 10 sandwiches\n#### 37"
