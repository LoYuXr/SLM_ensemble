    "question": "Martha has been collecting shells since she turned 5 years old, every month she collects one shell. By her 10th birthday, how many shells will Martha have collected?",
    "completion": "Martha has been collecting shells since she turned 5 years old, which means she has been collecting shells for 5 years. Since she collects one shell every month, we can calculate the total number of shells she has collected by multiplying the number of years by the number of months in a year.\n\nThere are 12 months in a year, so:\n\n5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months\n\nSince Martha collects one shell every month, she will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.",
    "answer": "In 12 months of the year, Martha collects 12 * 1 = <<12*1=12>>12 shells.\nFrom her 5th to her 10th birthday, 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 years have passed.\nDuring the 5 years that have passed, Martha has collected 12 * 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 shells.\n#### 60"
