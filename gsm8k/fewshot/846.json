    "question": "Vicki is planning a pop concert at her high school. The show will be 2 hours. She is allowing each group 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and then 2 minutes to exit the stage. If she allows a 10-minute intermission, how many groups can perform in the concert?",
    "completion": "To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for the show and the intermission, and then divide that by the time each group is allowed to perform.\n\n1. **Calculate the total time available for the show:**\n   - The show is 2 hours long.\n   - Convert hours to minutes: \\(2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\n2. **Add the time for the intermission:**\n   - The intermission is 10 minutes long.\n   - Add the intermission time to the show time: \\(120 \\text{ minutes} + 10 \\text{ minutes} = 130 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\n3. **Determine the number of groups that can perform:**\n   - Each group is allowed 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage.\n   - Calculate the total time each group spends on the stage: \\(2 \\text{ minutes} + 6 \\text{ minutes} + 2 \\text{ minutes} = 10 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n   - Divide the total time available by the time each group spends on the stage: \\(130 \\text{ minutes} \\div 10 \\text{ minutes/group} = 13 \\text{ groups}\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",
    "answer": "First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.\nOf those 120 minutes, 10 will be used for intermission, so 120 \u2013 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for performances.\nEach group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time.\nOf the 110 minutes of performances, 10 are used per group, so 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform.\n#### 11"
