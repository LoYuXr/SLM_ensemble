    "question": "Sitti and Juris bought 34 and 22 oranges, respectively. If both of them decide to share them equally with their 6 other friends, how many oranges will everyone get?",
    "completion": "To determine how many oranges each person will get, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of people sharing the oranges.\n2. Divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of people sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are two people, and they have 6 other friends. Therefore, the total number of people is:\n\\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people. Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:\n\\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \\]\n\nNow, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:\n\\[ \\frac{56}{8} = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, each person will get \\(\\boxed{7}\\) oranges.",
    "answer": "There are a total of 34 + 22 = <<34+22=56>>56 oranges.\nSitti, Juris, and 6 other friends will divide them equally which means there are 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 of them sharing.\nSo, each one will get 56 oranges / 8 people = <<56/8=7>>7 oranges/person\n#### 7"
