    "question": "A bus travels 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. A car travels 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. How much farther did the bus go than the car, in miles?",
    "completion": "To determine how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between these distances.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance traveled by the bus:\n- The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour.\n- The bus travels for 5 hours.\n- Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\\[ \\text{Distance}_{\\text{bus}} = 60 \\, \\text{miles/hour} \\times 5 \\, \\text{hours} = 300 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance traveled by the car:\n- The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour.\n- The car travels for 8 hours.\n- Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\\[ \\text{Distance}_{\\text{car}} = 30 \\, \\text{miles/hour} \\times 8 \\, \\text{hours} = 240 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the bus and the car:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Distance}_{\\text{bus}} - \\text{Distance}_{\\text{car}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 300 \\, \\text{miles} - 240 \\, \\text{miles} = 60 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.",
    "answer": "The bus traveled 60 miles per hour * 5 hours = <<60*5=300>>300 miles.\nThe car traveled 30 miles per hour * 8 hours = <<30*8=240>>240 miles.\nSo, the bus went 300 - 240 = <<300-240=60>>60 miles farther than the car.\n#### 60"
