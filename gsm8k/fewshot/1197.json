    "question": "John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.  He also buys twice as many bottles of cognac that cost 50% more per bottle.  How much does he spend on everything?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of the scotch and cognac that John buys, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much John spends on the cognac. We know that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Since the scotch costs $600, the cognac costs:\n\\[ 600 \\times 1.5 = 900 \\text{ dollars per bottle} \\]\n\nJohn buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does scotch. Since he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:\n\\[ 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ bottles of cognac} \\]\n\nThe total cost for the cognac is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 900 = 18000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac to find the total amount spent:\n\\[ 600 + 18000 = 18600 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount John spends on everything is:\n\\[ \\boxed{18600} \\]",
    "answer": "The scotch cost $600/10=$<<600/10=60>>60 each\nHe bought 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 bottles of cognac\nEach bottle cost .5*60=$<<.5*60=30>>30 more than the scotch\nSo they cost $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90\nThat means he spent $90*20=$<<90*20=1800>>1800 on the cognac\nSo he spent a total of $600+$1800=$<<600+1800=2400>>2400\n#### 2400"
