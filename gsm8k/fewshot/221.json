    "question": "A water tank is filled with 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her small garden. She was then able to collect rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. How many liters of water are in the tank now?",
    "completion": "To determine how much water is in the tank now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used some:**\n   The tank initially contains 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters to water her garden.\n   \\[\n   120 \\text{ liters} - 90 \\text{ liters} = 30 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n   So, there are 30 liters of water left in the tank.\n\n2. **Determine the amount of rainwater collected:**\n   The rainwater collected is twice the amount of water left in the tank.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 30 \\text{ liters} = 60 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n   So, 60 liters of rainwater were collected.\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of water in the tank now:**\n   The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left and the rainwater collected.\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ liters} + 60 \\text{ liters} = 90 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the amount of water in the tank now is \\(\\boxed{90}\\) liters.",
    "answer": "After watering Celine's garden, 120 - 90 = <<120-90=30>>30 liters of water were left in the tank.\nCeline was able to collect 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 liters of rainwater.\nThus, there are 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 liters of water in the tank.\n#### 90"
