    "question": "There are 10000 gallons of water in a pool. Using a water pump, Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day, how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days?",
    "completion": "To determine how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of water added to the tank each day:**\n   - The pool is filled to half its capacity, which is 500 gallons.\n   - The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.\n   - Therefore, the amount of water added to the tank each day is:\n     \\[\n     500 \\text{ gallons/day} - 500 \\text{ gallons/day} = 0 \\text{ gallons/day}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total amount of water added over 6 days:**\n   - Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, over 6 days, the total amount of water added is:\n     \\[\n     500 \\text{ gallons/day} \\times 6 \\text{ days} = 3000 \\text{ gallons}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the remaining amount of water in the tank:**\n   - Initially, the tank had 5000 gallons of water.\n   - After 6 days, the tank has been emptied by 3000 gallons.\n   - Therefore, the remaining amount of water in the tank is:\n     \\[\n     5000 \\text{ gallons} - 3000 \\text{ gallons} = 2000 \\text{ gallons}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is \\(\\boxed{2000}\\) gallons.",
    "answer": "The water pump takes 1/2 *10000 = <<5000=5000>>5000 gallons of the pool's water into the tank.\nIf 500 gallons of water is used daily for six days, the total amount of water used after six days is 500*6 = <<500*6=3000>>3000 gallons.\nThe total amount of water remaining in the tank will be 5000-3000 = <<5000-3000=2000>>2000 gallons\n#### 2000"
