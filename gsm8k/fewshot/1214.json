    "question": "Jordan has 2 children who wear diapers.  Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.  Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.  How many diapers does Jordan change per day?",
    "completion": "To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes required per day for both children.\n2. Determine how many diaper changes Jordan's wife changes.\n3. Subtract the number of diaper changes Jordan's wife changes from the total number of diaper changes required to find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes required per day for both children:\n- Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.\n- Jordan has 2 children.\n\nSo, the total number of diaper changes required per day is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ diaper changes/child} \\times 2 \\text{ children} = 10 \\text{ diaper changes/day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many diaper changes Jordan's wife changes. According to the problem, Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers:\n\\[ \\text{Number of diaper changes Jordan's wife changes} = \\frac{10 \\text{ diaper changes/day}}{2} = 5 \\text{ diaper changes/day} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of diaper changes Jordan's wife changes from the total number of diaper changes required to find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ diaper changes/day} - 5 \\text{ diaper changes/day} = 5 \\text{ diaper changes/day} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of diapers Jordan changes per day is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Jordan has 2 children, each requiring 5 diaper changes per day, for a total of 5*2=<<2*5=10>>10 diaper changes per day.\nJordan's wife changes half of the diapers, leaving Jordan to change the other half, for a total of 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 diaper changes per day that Jordan is responsible for.\n#### 5"
