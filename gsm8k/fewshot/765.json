    "question": "George has 45% more pears than bananas. If George has 200 bananas, how many fruits does George have?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of fruits George has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of pears George has:**\n   George has 45% more pears than bananas. If George has 200 bananas, we can find the number of pears by calculating 45% of 200 and adding that to the original number of bananas.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of pears} = 200 + 0.45 \\times 200\n   \\]\n\n   First, calculate 45% of 200:\n\n   \\[\n   0.45 \\times 200 = 90\n   \\]\n\n   Now, add this to the original number of bananas:\n\n   \\[\n   200 + 90 = 290\n   \\]\n\n   So, George has 290 pears.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of fruits:**\n   To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of fruits} = \\text{Number of bananas} + \\text{Number of pears}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of fruits} = 200 + 290 = 490\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, George has a total of 490 fruits.",
    "answer": "If George has 200 bananas, 45% more than that number is 45/100*200 = <<200*0.45=90>>90\nThe total number of pears that George has is 200+90 =<<200+90=290>>290\nTogether, George has 290 pears + 200 bananas = <<290+200=490>>490 fruits\n#### 490"
