    "question": "Baldur gets water from a well. He gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. If each pail contains 5 liters of water, how many liters of water does he get every day?",
    "completion": "To determine how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total amount of water he gets from both morning and afternoon waterings.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of water Baldur gets in one day from morning waterings:\n- Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning.\n- Each pail contains 5 liters of water.\n- Therefore, the amount of water from morning waterings is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\text{ pails} \\times 5 \\text{ liters/pail} = 25 \\text{ liters}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of water Baldur gets in one day from afternoon waterings:\n- Baldur gets 6 pails of water every afternoon.\n- Each pail contains 5 liters of water.\n- Therefore, the amount of water from afternoon waterings is:\n  \\[\n  6 \\text{ pails} \\times 5 \\text{ liters/pail} = 30 \\text{ liters}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we add the amounts of water from morning and afternoon waterings to find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day:\n\\[\n25 \\text{ liters} + 30 \\text{ liters} = 55 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nThus, Baldur gets \\boxed{55} liters of water every day.",
    "answer": "Baldur gets 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 liters of water in the morning.\nHe gets 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 liters of water in the afternoon.\nTherefore, the total liters of water he gets every day is 30 + 25 = <<30+25=55>>55.\n#### 55"
