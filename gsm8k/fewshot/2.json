    "question": "Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?",
    "completion": "To determine the profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the house:**\n   Josh bought the house for $80,000.\n\n2. **Calculate the total value of the house after repairs:**\n   The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the value of the house after repairs is 150% of the original value.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value after repairs} = 150\\% \\times 80,000 = 1.5 \\times 80,000 = 120,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the house including repairs:**\n   The total cost of the house is the sum of the original cost and the repairs.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the profit:**\n   The profit is the difference between the total value of the house after repairs and the total cost of the house.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = \\text{Value after repairs} - \\text{Total cost} = 120,000 - 130,000 = -10,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the profit Josh made is \\(\\boxed{-10000}\\).",
    "answer": "The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000\nHe increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000\nSo the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000\nSo he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000\n#### 70000"
