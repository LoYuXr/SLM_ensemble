    "question": "Colby wants to buy some gumballs that cost a nickel each. If he has 8 quarters, 6 dimes, 14 nickels, and 15 pennies, how many can he buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total value of the coins he has and then divide that by the cost of one gumball, which is 5 cents.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the quarters:\n- Each quarter is worth 25 cents.\n- Colby has 8 quarters.\n- The total value of the quarters is \\(8 \\times 25 = 200\\) cents.\n\nNext, let's calculate the value of the dimes:\n- Each dime is worth 10 cents.\n- Colby has 6 dimes.\n- The total value of the dimes is \\(6 \\times 10 = 60\\) cents.\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of the nickels:\n- Each nickel is worth 5 cents.\n- Colby has 14 nickels.\n- The total value of the nickels is \\(14 \\times 5 = 70\\) cents.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the value of the pennies:\n- Each penny is worth 1 cent.\n- Colby has 15 pennies.\n- The total value of the pennies is \\(15 \\times 1 = 15\\) cents.\n\nNow, we sum up the values of all the coins:\n- The total value of the quarters is 200 cents.\n- The total value of the dimes is 60 cents.\n- The total value of the nickels is 70 cents.\n- The total value of the pennies is 15 cents.\n- The total value of all the coins is \\(200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345\\) cents.\n\nSince each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total value by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:\n\\[ \\frac{345}{5} = 69 \\]\n\nTherefore, Colby can buy \\(\\boxed{69}\\) gumballs.",
    "answer": "He has $2 in quarters because 8 times .25 equals <<8*.25=2>>2.\nHe has $.6 in dimes because 6 times .1 equals <<6*.1=.6>>.6\nHe has $.7 in nickels because 14 times .05 equals .7\nHe has $.15 in pennies because 15 times .01 equals <<15*.01=.15>>.15\nHe has $3.65 because 2 plus .6 plus .7 plus .15 equals $<<2+.6+.7+.15=3.45>>3.45\nHe can buy 69 gum balls because 3.65 divided by .05 equals 69\n#### 69"
