    "question": "In a student council election, candidate A got 20% of the votes while candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. The rest of the votes was given to candidate C. If there were 100 voters, how many votes did candidate C get?",
    "completion": "To determine how many votes candidate C received, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of votes candidate A received.\n2. Calculate the number of votes candidate B received.\n3. Determine the number of votes given to candidate C.\n4. Add the votes given to candidate C to the votes given to candidate A and candidate B to find the total number of votes.\n\nLet's start with step 1. Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, the number of votes candidate A received is:\n\\[ 20\\% \\text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \\times 100 = 20 \\text{ votes} \\]\n\nNext, for step 2, candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. So, the number of votes candidate B received is:\n\\[ 20\\% + 50\\% = 70\\% \\text{ of } 100 = 0.70 \\times 100 = 70 \\text{ votes} \\]\n\nNow, for step 3, the rest of the votes were given to candidate C. Therefore, the number of votes given to candidate C is:\n\\[ 100 - 20 - 70 = 10 \\text{ votes} \\]\n\nFinally, for step 4, we add the votes given to candidate C to the votes given to candidate A and candidate B to find the total number of votes:\n\\[ 20 + 70 + 10 = 100 \\text{ votes} \\]\n\nSo, the total number of votes candidate C received is:\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]",
    "answer": "Candidate A got 100 x 20/100 = <<100*20/100=20>>20 votes.\nCandidate B got 20 x 50/100 = <<20*50/100=10>>10 more votes than candidate A.\nThus, candidate B got 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 votes.\nCandidate A and B have 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 votes together.\nTherefore, candidate C got 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50 votes.\n#### 50"
