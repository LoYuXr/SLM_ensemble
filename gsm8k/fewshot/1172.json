    "question": "Alice likes to count the puffs of clouds in the sky while she eats her lunch outside at school. On Monday she counts just 3 puffs of clouds. Each day after that through Friday, though, she sees double the number of clouds in the sky as the day before. At the end of the week, how many clouds will she have counted in the sky at lunch across all five days?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of clouds Alice counts in the sky from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 clouds.\n2. **Tuesday**: Alice counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) clouds.\n3. **Wednesday**: Alice counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\) clouds.\n4. **Thursday**: Alice counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\) clouds.\n5. **Friday**: Alice counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is \\(24 \\times 2 = 48\\) clouds.\n\nNow, we sum the number of clouds from each day:\n\\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48\\]\n\nWe can add these step by step:\n\\[3 + 6 = 9\\]\n\\[9 + 12 = 21\\]\n\\[21 + 24 = 45\\]\n\\[45 + 48 = 93\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of clouds Alice counts in the sky from Monday to Friday is \\(\\boxed{93}\\).",
    "answer": "On Monday Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds in the sky, and double that on Tuesday, 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 puffs of clouds.\nOn Wednesday she sees twice that amount, 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 puffs of clouds.\nOn Thursday she sees twice that amount, 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 puffs of clouds.\nOn Friday she sees twice the amount of the day before, 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 puffs of clouds.\nIn total, across all five days, she sees 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = <<3+6+12+24+48=93>>93 total cloud puffs.\n#### 93"
