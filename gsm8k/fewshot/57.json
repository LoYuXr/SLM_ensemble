    "question": "A wooden bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. A delivery truck filled with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit?",
    "completion": "To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total weight of the driver and the empty truck:**\n   The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is given as 3755 pounds.\n\n2. **Determine the weight of the driver:**\n   The weight of the driver is 3755 pounds minus the weight of the empty truck. Since the empty truck weighs 3755 pounds, the driver weighs:\n   \\[\n   3755 - 3755 = 0 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n   This means the driver is empty.\n\n3. **Calculate the weight of the boxes:**\n   The weight of the boxes is 15 pounds per box. Let \\( n \\) be the number of boxes. The total weight of the boxes is:\n   \\[\n   15n \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set up the inequality for the bridge's weight limit:**\n   The bridge can carry a maximum of 5000 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of the boxes must be less than or equal to 5000 pounds:\n   \\[\n   15n \\leq 5000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( n \\):**\n   Divide both sides of the inequality by 15:\n   \\[\n   n \\leq \\frac{5000}{15}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n \\leq 333.33\n   \\]\n   Since \\( n \\) must be a whole number, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 333.\n\n6. **Verify the solution:**\n   If \\( n = 333 \\), the total weight of the boxes is:\n   \\[\n   15 \\times 333 = 4995 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n   This weight is within the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is \\(\\boxed{333}\\).",
    "answer": "The boxes can weigh up to 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = <<5000-3755=1245>>1245 pounds in total.\nThere can be 1245 / 15 = <<1245/15=83>>83 boxes loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.\n#### 83"
