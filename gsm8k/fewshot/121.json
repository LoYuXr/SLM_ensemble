    "question": "Morisette and Kael were asked to bring fruits. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, while Kael brought twice the amount of apples and half the number of oranges than Morisette. How many fruits do they have in total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of fruits brought by Morisette and Kael, we need to calculate the number of each type of fruit each person brought and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of fruits Morisette brought:\n- Morisette brought 5 apples.\n- Morisette brought 8 oranges.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of fruits Kael brought:\n- Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette. Since Morisette brought 5 apples, Kael brought \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) apples.\n- Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette. Since Morisette brought 8 oranges, Kael brought \\(\\frac{8}{2} = 4\\) oranges.\n\nNow, we sum up the total number of fruits brought by both:\n- Total apples = 5 (Morisette) + 10 (Kael) = 15 apples.\n- Total oranges = 8 (Morisette) + 4 (Kael) = 12 oranges.\n\nAdding these together gives the total number of fruits:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ apples} + 12 \\text{ oranges} = 27 \\text{ fruits} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of fruits they have in total is \\(\\boxed{27}\\).",
    "answer": "Kael brought 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 apples.\nAnd he also brought 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges.\nTherefore, Kael and Morisette brought 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = <<5+10+8+4=27>>27 fruits in total.\n#### 27"
