    "question": "Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted 56 easter eggs. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. How many more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we start by defining the number of eggs each person painted. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah as \\( A \\), \\( M \\), \\( C \\), and \\( S \\) respectively.\n\nFrom the problem, we know the following:\n1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so \\( A = M \\).\n2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so \\( C + S = 30 \\).\n3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \\( C = S + 12 \\).\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the third equation to find \\( S \\):\n\\[ C = S + 12 \\]\n\\[ C + S = 30 \\]\nSubstituting \\( C = S + 12 \\) into the equation \\( C + S = 30 \\):\n\\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \\]\n\\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \\]\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\\[ 2S = 18 \\]\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[ S = 9 \\]\nNow that we know \\( S = 9 \\), we can find \\( C \\) and \\( M \\):\n\\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \\]\n\\[ M = S = 9 \\]\n\nSo, Arnold painted 9 eggs, Madeline painted 9 eggs, Camden painted 21 eggs, and Sarah painted 9 eggs. The difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is:\n\\[ C - A = 21 - 9 = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, Camden painted \\(\\boxed{12}\\) more eggs than Arnold.",
    "answer": "Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = <<56-30=26>>26 easter eggs.\nArnold and Madeline each painted 26/2 = <<26/2=13>>13 easter eggs.\nSarah painted (30 - 12)/2 = 18/2 = <<(30-12)/2=9>>9 easter eggs.\nCamden painted 9 + 12 = <<9+12=21>>21 easter eggs.\nCamden painted 21 - 13 = <<21-13=8>>8 eggs more than Arnold.\n#### 8"
