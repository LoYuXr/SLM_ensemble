    "question": "Finn watches 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond.  Suddenly he sees 6 of them come out of hiding from under a lily pad ,then he sees 2 of them hide under a rock.  How many tadpoles can Finn see in the pond now?",
    "completion": "To determine how many tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, we need to consider the changes in the number of tadpoles he can see step by step.\n\n1. Initially, Finn watches 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond.\n2. Then, he sees 6 of them come out of hiding from under a lily pad. This means he now has 11 - 6 = 5 more tadpoles to see.\n3. Next, he sees 2 of them hide under a rock. This means he now has 5 + 2 = 7 more tadpoles to see.\n\nSo, the total number of tadpoles Finn can now see in the pond is the sum of the tadpoles he can see initially and the tadpoles he can see after seeing the new ones:\n\n\\[ 11 + 5 + 2 = 18 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
    "answer": "When the hidden tadpoles come out, Finn sees 11 + 6 = <<11+6=17>>17 tadpoles swimming.\nAfter some of them hide under a rock, he now sees 17 - 2 = <<17-2=15>>15 tadpoles swimming.\n#### 15"
