    "question": "At the trip to the county-level scavenger hunt competition, 90 people were required to split into groups for the competition to begin. To break people up into smaller groups with different leaders, 9-person groups were formed. If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each, how many seashells did they bring?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of seashells brought by the participants, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of groups:**\n   Since 90 people were required to split into groups of 9, we divide the total number of people by the group size:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of groups} = \\frac{90}{9} = 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of seashells brought by each group:**\n   Each group brings back 2 seashells. Since there are 10 groups, the total number of seashells brought is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total seashells} = 10 \\times 2 = 20\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of seashells brought by the participants is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
    "answer": "Since the total number of people at the competition was 90, they formed 90/9=<<90/9=10>>10 groups after splitting into 9-person groups.\nIf 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bringing back 2 seashells each, then 3/5*10=<<3/5*10=6>>6 groups had members bringing back 2 seashells.\nSince each group had 9 people, the number of people in the 6 groups, who found 2 seashells each, was 6*9= <<6*9=54>>54.\nThe total number of seashells the 54 people brought is 54*2=<<54*2=108>>108 seashells.\n#### 108"
