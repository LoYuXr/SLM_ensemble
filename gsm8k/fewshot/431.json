    "question": "Dora wants to buy a skipping rope that costs $6, a board game that costs $11, and a playground ball that costs $2. She has saved $2 from her allowance, and her mother gave her $16. How much more money does Dora need to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the ball, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy.\n2. Subtract the amount of money Dora has saved from the total cost to find out how much more money she needs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the items:\n- The skipping rope costs $6.\n- The board game costs $11.\n- The playground ball costs $2.\n\nAdding these amounts together, we get:\n\\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \\]\n\nSo, the total cost of the items is $19.\n\nNext, we subtract the amount of money Dora has saved from the total cost:\n- Dora has saved $2.\n- The total cost of the items is $19.\n\nSubtracting $2 from $19, we get:\n\\[ 19 - 2 = 17 \\]\n\nTherefore, Dora needs \\(\\boxed{17}\\) more dollars to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the ball.",
    "answer": "The total cost of the skipping rope, the game, and the ball is $6 + $11 + $2 = $<<6+11+2=19>>19.\nThe total amount of money from the allowance and her mother is $2 + $16 = $<<2+16=18>>18.\nDora needs $19 \u2212 $18 = $1.\n#### 1"
