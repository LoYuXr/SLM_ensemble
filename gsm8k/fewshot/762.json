    "question": "Jayden had $70 from selling pictures he took as a hobby.  His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance to help him buy a new camera that costs $200. How much more does Jayden need to buy the camera?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how much money Jayden has after receiving his sister's allowance.\n2. Determine how much more money Jayden needs to buy the camera.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much money Jayden has after receiving his sister's allowance. Jayden originally had $70 and his sister gave him $90. So, we add these amounts together:\n\n\\[ 70 + 90 = 160 \\]\n\nJayden now has $160. The camera costs $200, so we need to find out how much more money Jayden needs to buy the camera. We do this by subtracting the amount of money Jayden has from the cost of the camera:\n\n\\[ 200 - 160 = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jayden needs \\(\\boxed{40}\\) more dollars to buy the camera.",
    "answer": "Ava gave $90/2 = $<<90/2=45>>45 to Jayden.\nJayden now has $70 + $45 = $<<70+45=115>>115\nSo, Jayden needs $200 - $115 = $<<200-115=85>>85 to buy the new camera\n#### 85"
