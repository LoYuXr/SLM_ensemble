    "question": "Max bought stamps at the post office. Some of the stamps had a snowflake design, some had a truck design, and some had a rose design. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. How many stamps did Max buy in all?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Snowflake Stamps:**\n   Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.\n\n2. **Truck Stamps:**\n   Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Since he bought 16 snowflake stamps, the number of truck stamps is:\n   \\[\n   16 + 3 = 19\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rose Stamps:**\n   Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Since he bought 19 truck stamps, the number of rose stamps is:\n   \\[\n   19 - 9 = 10\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Stamps:**\n   To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together:\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \\text{ (truck)} + 10 \\text{ (rose)} = 45\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of stamps Max bought is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
    "answer": "Max bought 16 + 3 = <<16+3=19>>19 truck stamps.\nMax bought 19 \u2013 9 = <<19-9=10>>10 rose stamps.\nIn total Max bought 16 snowflake + 19 truck + 10 rose stamps = <<16+19+10=45>>45 stamps.\n#### 45"
