    "question": "Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.  She ended up returning one item that cost $15.00.  After she returned the item, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00 and a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00.  She put both of these purchases on her credit card.  What is the new balance on her credit card?",
    "completion": "To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the items she returned.\n2. Calculate the discounted prices of the items she bought.\n3. Add the discounted prices to the original total cost.\n4. Subtract the new balance from the original balance to find the new balance.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The total cost of the items she returned is:\n   \\[\n   15.00 + 15.00 = 30.00\n   \\]\n\n2. The discounted price of the frying pan is 20% off $20.00:\n   \\[\n   20.00 \\times (1 - 0.20) = 20.00 \\times 0.80 = 16.00\n   \\]\n\n3. The discounted price of the set of towels is 10% off $30.00:\n   \\[\n   30.00 \\times (1 - 0.10) = 30.00 \\times 0.90 = 27.00\n   \\]\n\n4. The new balance on her credit card is the original balance plus the total cost of the items she returned and the discounted prices of the items she bought:\n   \\[\n   85.00 + 30.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 158.00\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the new balance on her credit card is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{158.00}\n\\]",
    "answer": "She charged $85.00 on her card and just returned a $15.00 purchase so right now, her credit card has 85-15 = $<<85-15=70.00>>70.00 balance\nThe frying pan is 20% off of $20.00 so .20*20.00 = $<<20*.01*20=4.00>>4.00\nThe frying pan costs $20.00 and the discount price is $4.00 so the new price is 20-4=$<<20-4=16.00>>16.00\nThe towel set is 10% off of $30.00 so .10*30 = $<<10*.01*30=3.00>>3.00\nThe towel set costs $30.00 and the discount price is $3.00 so the new price is 30-3= $<<30-3=27.00>>27.00\nHer new purchases total 16+27 = $$<<16+27=43.00>>43.00\nAfter the return, her card balance was $70.00 and she just added $43.00 in purchases so her new balance is 70+43 = $<<70+43=113.00>>113.00\n#### 113"
