    "question": "Last night Rick killed ten wolves and 15 cougars while hunting. Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night. How many animals did Rick kill?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's identify the number of wolves and cougars killed last night:\n- Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cougars Rick killed today. According to the problem, today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 10 wolves last night, today he killed:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ cougars} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many wolves Rick killed today. The problem states that today he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, today he killed:\n\\[ 15 - 3 = 12 \\text{ wolves} \\]\n\nFinally, we add up the number of wolves and cougars killed today to get the total number of animals killed:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ wolves} + 15 \\text{ cougars} = 27 \\text{ animals} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of animals Rick killed is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{27}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The total number of animals that Rick killed while hunting yesterday is 15+10 = <<15+10=25>>25\nToday, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, a total of 15-3 = <<15-3=12>>12 cougars.\nHe also killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, a total of 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 wolves.\nTogether, his hunt today yielded 36+12 = <<36+12=48>>48 animals.\nIn total, he has 48+25 = <<48+25=73>>73 animals from the hunt.\n#### 73"
