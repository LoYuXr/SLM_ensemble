    "question": "Mr Boarden is remodeling his bathroom. For every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. How many mosaic tiles would Mr Boarden need to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom?",
    "completion": "To determine how many mosaic tiles Mr Boarden would need to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tiles needed for the entire bathroom.\n2. Calculate the number of tiles needed for two thirds of the bathroom.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of tiles needed for the entire bathroom. Since Mr Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the total square footage by the number of tiles per square foot:\n\\[\n36 \\text{ square feet} \\times 24 \\text{ tiles per square foot} = 864 \\text{ tiles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of tiles needed for two thirds of the bathroom. We do this by multiplying the total square footage by two thirds:\n\\[\n36 \\text{ square feet} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 24 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\nSince Mr Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the number of tiles needed for two thirds of the bathroom by 24:\n\\[\n24 \\text{ tiles per square foot} \\times 24 \\text{ square feet} = 576 \\text{ tiles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mr Boarden would need \\boxed{576} mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom.",
    "answer": "A third of Mr. Boarden's bathroom is 36/3 = <<36/3=12>>12 sqft\nTwo thirds of Mr. Boarden's bathroom is 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 sq ft\nMr. Boarden needs 24 x 24 = <<24*24=576>>576 mosaic tiles\n#### 576"
