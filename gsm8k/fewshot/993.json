    "question": "An airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times a day. Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?",
    "completion": "To determine how many flights to France the first plane takes in one day, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **First Plane's Flight Schedule:**\n   - The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.\n   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and Germany.\n   - Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \\( F \\).\n\n2. **First Plane's Flight Distribution:**\n   - The first plane flies to Greece for \\( \\frac{3}{4}F \\) flights.\n   - The remaining \\( \\frac{1}{4}F \\) flights are split equally between flights to France and Germany.\n   - Therefore, the number of flights to France and Germany combined is \\( \\frac{1}{4}F \\).\n\n3. **Total Flights to France and Germany:**\n   - The total number of flights to France and Germany combined is \\( \\frac{1}{4}F \\).\n\n4. **Total Flights to Poland:**\n   - The first plane flies to Poland for 44 trips.\n   - The total number of flights to Poland is 44.\n\n5. **Flight Distribution to Poland:**\n   - Since the first plane flies to Poland for 44 trips, and the total number of flights to France and Germany combined is \\( \\frac{1}{4}F \\), the remaining flights to France and Germany combined must be \\( 44 - \\frac{1}{4}F \\).\n\n6. **Flight Distribution to France:**\n   - The first plane flies to France for the remaining \\( 44 - \\frac{1}{4}F \\) flights.\n   - The number of flights to France is \\( 44 - \\frac{1}{4}F \\).\n\n7. **Flight Distribution to Germany:**\n   - The first plane flies to Germany for the remaining \\( 44 - \\frac{1}{4}F \\) flights.\n   - The number of flights to Germany is \\( 44 - \\frac{1}{4}F \\).\n\n8. **Total Flights to France and Germany:**\n   - The total number of flights to France and Germany combined is \\( 44 - \\frac{1}{4}F \\).\n\n9. **Flight Distribution to France and Germany:**\n   - The total number of flights to France and Germany combined is \\( 44 - \\frac{1",
    "answer": "The second plane flies half as much as the first, so the first plane makes 44 flights * 2 = <<44*2=88>>88 flights a day.\nIf 3/4 of the first plane\u2019s flights are to Greece, then flights to France or Germany make up 1 \u2013 3/4 = 1/4 of the total daily flights.\nTherefore, 88 daily flights / 4 = <<88/4=22>>22 flights to France or Germany.\nSplitting these flights equally means the first plane makes 22 flights / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 flights to France in one day.\n#### 11"
