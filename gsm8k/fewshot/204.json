    "question": "Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Then she bought 6 bags of blue pens and 2 bags of red pens. There were 9 pens in each bag of blue and 6 pens in each bag of red. How many pens does Janet have now?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in each color separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of blue pens:\n- Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens.\n- Each bag contains 9 pens.\n- Therefore, the total number of blue pens is \\(6 \\times 9 = 54\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of red pens:\n- Janet bought 2 bags of red pens.\n- Each bag contains 6 pens.\n- Therefore, the total number of red pens is \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\).\n\nNow, we add the number of green pens, yellow pens, blue pens, and red pens to find the total number of pens:\n- Janet originally had 22 green pens.\n- She had 10 yellow pens.\n- The total number of blue pens is 54.\n- The total number of red pens is 12.\n- Therefore, the total number of pens is \\(22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98\\).\n\nSo, the total number of pens Janet has now is \\(\\boxed{98}\\).",
    "answer": "Janet previously had 22 + 10 = <<22+10=32>>32 pens.\nThe number of blue pens is 6 \u00d7 9 = <<6*9=54>>54.\nThe number of red pens is 2 \u00d7 6 = <<2*6=12>>12.\nJanet has 32 + 54 + 12 = <<32+54+12=98>>98 pens now.\n#### 98"
