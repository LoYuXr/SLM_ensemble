    "question": "James gets 10 new CDs.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40. How much money was he out?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money James was out, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the CDs before any discounts.\n2. Apply the 40% discount to the total cost.\n3. Subtract the discounted price from the original price to find out how much James paid.\n4. Subtract the price of the CDs he didn't like from the total amount he paid to find out how much he sold them for.\n5. Calculate the total amount James was out by subtracting the amount he sold the CDs from the amount he paid.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the CDs before any discounts:**\n   Each CD costs $15, and James gets 10 CDs.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 10 \\times 15 = 150 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the 40% discount to the total cost:**\n   The discount is 40%, so James pays 60% of the total cost.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discounted price} = 150 \\times (1 - 0.40) = 150 \\times 0.60 = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the discounted price from the original price to find out how much James paid:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount paid} = 150 - 90 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the price of the CDs he didn't like from the total amount he paid to find out how much he sold them for:**\n   James didn't like 5 CDs, so he sold them for 5 CDs at $40 each.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount sold} = 5 \\times 40 = 200 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total amount James was out:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount out} = \\text{Amount paid} - \\text{Amount sold} = 60 - 200 = -140 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nSince the result is negative, it indicates that James spent more money than he received. Therefore, James was out $140.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{140}\n\\]",
    "answer": "He got a 15*.4=$<<15*.4=6>>6 discount on each CD\nThat means each CD cost 15-6=$<<15-6=9>>9\nSo he paid 10*9=$<<10*9=90>>90\nThat means he was out 90-40=$<<90-40=50>>50\n#### 50"
