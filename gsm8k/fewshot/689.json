    "question": "Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies that cost $3.20. If each lollipop costs $0.40, how much will 10 lollipops and 10 candies cost him?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the lollipops.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the candies.\n3. Add the costs of the lollipops and candies to get the total cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the lollipops. Manolo bought 5 lollipops, and each lollipop costs $0.40. So, the total cost of the lollipops is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ lollipops} \\times \\$0.40 \\text{ per lollipop} = \\$2.00 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the candies. Manolo bought 4 candies, and each candy costs $3.20. So, the total cost of the candies is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ candies} \\times \\$3.20 \\text{ per candy} = \\$12.80 \\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the lollipops and the cost of the candies to get the total cost:\n\\[ \\$2.00 + \\$12.80 = \\$14.80 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:\n\\[ \\boxed{14.80} \\]",
    "answer": "Five lollipops cost $0.4 x 5 = $<<0.4*5=2>>2.\nSo four candies cost $3.20 - $2 = $1.20.\nThus, each candy costs $1.20/4 = $<<1.20/4=0.30>>0.30.\nTen lollipops cost $0.4 x 10 = $<<0.4*10=4>>4.\nTen candies cost $0.30 x 10 = $<<0.30*10=3>>3.\nHence, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4 + $3 = $7.\n#### 7"
