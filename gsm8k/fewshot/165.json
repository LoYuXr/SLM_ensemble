    "question": "For his 30th birthday, Elvira chose a new computer with many accessories as a gift. She has a budget of \u20ac1500 donated by her whole family and thinks that she will be able to keep a little money to afford a garment. She goes to a computer store and chooses a machine that costs \u20ac1090 with a screen, keyboard and mouse. She also takes a scanner for \u20ac157, a CD burner worth \u20ac74 and a printer for \u20ac102. How much money will she have left for her clothing?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing after her purchases, we need to subtract the total cost of her computer accessories from her budget. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of the computer accessories:\n   - Computer screen: \u20ac1090\n   - Keyboard: \u20ac157\n   - Mouse: \u20ac74\n   - Scanner: \u20ac157\n   - CD burner: \u20ac74\n   - Printer: \u20ac102\n\n2. Calculate the total cost of the computer accessories:\n   \\[\n   1090 + 157 + 74 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 2380\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtract the total cost of the computer accessories from her budget:\n   \\[\n   1500 - 2380 = -880\n   \\]\n\nSince the result is negative, it means Elvira will have a deficit of \u20ac880. Therefore, she will not have enough money left to afford her clothing.\n\nThe amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is \\boxed{-880}.",
    "answer": "First, let\u2019s look at the total cost of computer equipment: 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = <<1090+157+74+102=1423>>1423 euros\nLet us now calculate what is left for the garment: 1500 - 1423 = <<1500-1423=77>>77 euros\n#### 77"
