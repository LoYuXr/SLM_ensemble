    "question": "John decides to take up an odd hobby of speed talking.  His normally speaking speed is 150 WPM.  After training his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed.  How long would it take him to speak 10 pages if each page has 450 words per page?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate John's new speaking speed:**\n   John's original speaking speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.\n   \\[\n   \\text{New speaking speed} = 150 \\, \\text{WPM} \\times 2.5 = 375 \\, \\text{WPM}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of words per page:**\n   Each page has 450 words.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of pages John needs to speak:**\n   John needs to speak 10 pages.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of pages} = 10\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of words John needs to speak:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of words} = 10 \\, \\text{pages} \\times 450 \\, \\text{words/page} = 4500 \\, \\text{words}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at the new speed:**\n   John's new speaking speed is 375 WPM.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of words}}{\\text{New speaking speed}} = \\frac{4500 \\, \\text{words}}{375 \\, \\text{WPM}} = 12 \\, \\text{minutes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed.",
    "answer": "He can speak 150*2.5=<<150*2.5=375>>375 words per minute\nHe wants to say 450*10=<<450*10=4500>>4500 words\nSo he can speak them in 4500/375=<<4500/375=12>>12 minutes\n#### 12"
