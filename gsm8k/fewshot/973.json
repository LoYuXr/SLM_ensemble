    "question": "India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. What's the total number of states in both countries together?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of states in both India and the USA, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of states in the USA.\n2. Calculate half the number of states in the USA.\n3. Add 4 to the result from step 2 to find the number of states in India.\n4. Add the number of states in the USA to the number of states in India to get the total number of states in both countries.\n\nLet's start with the number of states in the USA. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, we calculate half the number of states in the USA as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of states in the USA} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Number of states in India}\n\\]\n\nSince the problem does not provide the number of states in India, we will assume that the number of states in India is a variable \\( x \\). Then the number of states in the USA is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of states in the USA} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times x\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of states in India. The problem states that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, we calculate half the number of states in the USA as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of states in India} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times x = \\frac{1}{4} \\times x\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of states in the USA to the number of states in India to get the total number of states in both countries:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of states} = \\text{Number of states in the USA} + \\text{Number of states in India} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times x + \\frac{1}{4} \\times x = \\frac{2}{4} \\times x + \\frac{1}{4} \\times x = \\frac{3}{4} \\times x\n\\]\n\nSince the problem does not provide the exact number of states in India, we can express the total number of states in terms of \\( x \\). However, if we assume the number of states in India is a specific number, we can substitute that value into the equation. For the sake of this problem, let's",
    "answer": "Since the number of states in the USA is 50, half that number is 1/2*50 = 25\nSince there are 4 more than half the number of states in the USA in India, there are 25+4 = <<4+25=29>>29 states in India.\nTogether, the two countries have 50+29 = <<50+29=79>>79 states.\n#### 79"
