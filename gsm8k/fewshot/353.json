    "question": "John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  This was 30% of the time he spent.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?",
    "completion": "To determine how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total time spent on activities:**\n   - John spends 6 hours boating.\n   - He spends half that time swimming, which is \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) hours swimming.\n   - He watches 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent on shows is \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) hours.\n   - The total time spent on all activities is \\( 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \\) hours.\n\n2. **Determine the time spent on sightseeing:**\n   - John spends 40% of his total time on sightseeing.\n   - Therefore, the time spent on sightseeing is \\( 0.40 \\times 15 = 6 \\) hours.\n\nSo, the time John spent sightseeing is \\(\\boxed{6}\\) hours.",
    "answer": "He spent 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours swimming\nHe spent 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 hours watching shows\nSo he spent 6+3+6=<<6+3+6=15>>15 hours on these activities\nThat means he spent 15/.3=<<15/.3=50>>50 hours on activities\nSo he spent 50*.4=<<50*.4=20>>20 hours sightseeing\n#### 20"
