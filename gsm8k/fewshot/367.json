    "question": "3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.  Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, how many were kicked out for other reasons?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of customers who were kicked out for other reasons, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- \\( x \\) is the number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.\n- \\( y \\) is the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting.\n- \\( z \\) is the number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.\n\nFrom the problem, we know the following:\n1. The total number of customers who were kicked out is 50.\n2. The number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks is four times the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting.\n3. The number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting is three times the number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.\n\nWe can translate these statements into the following equations:\n1. \\( x + y + z = 50 \\)\n2. \\( x = 4y \\)\n3. \\( y = 3z \\)\n\nFirst, we substitute the expressions for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:\n\\[ 4y + y + z = 50 \\]\n\\[ 5y + z = 50 \\]\n\nNext, we substitute the expression for \\( y \\) from equation 3 into the equation \\( 5y + z = 50 \\):\n\\[ 5(3z) + z = 50 \\]\n\\[ 15z + z = 50 \\]\n\\[ 16z = 50 \\]\n\\[ z = \\frac{50}{16} \\]\n\\[ z = 3.125 \\]\n\nSince the number of customers must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem statement and the interpretation of the equations. However, the problem as stated seems to have a logical inconsistency because the number of customers cannot be a fraction. Assuming the problem meant to say the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting is three times the number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, we can proceed with the correct interpretation.\n\nGiven the correct interpretation, we have:\n\\[ y = 3z \\]\n\\[ y = 3 \\times 3.125 = 9.375 \\]\n\nSince the number of customers",
    "answer": "First quadruple the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks: 4 * 3 customers = <<4*3=12>>12 customers\nThen subtract 5 from this number: 12 customers - 5 customers = 7 customers\nThen triple that number to find the number of people kicked out for violence: 7 customers * 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 customers\nThen subtract the number of customers kicked out for each known reason to find the number kicked out for other reasons: 50 customers - 3 customers - 21 customers - 7 customers = <<50-3-21-7=19>>19 customers\n#### 19"
