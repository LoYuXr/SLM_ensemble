    "question": "John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field. There are 100 pineapples per hectare. John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. How many pineapples can John harvest within a year?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in one year.\n2. Determine how many pineapples he can harvest in one month.\n3. Calculate the total number of pineapples he can harvest in one month.\n\nFirst, we know that John has 10 hectares of pineapple field. Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare, the total number of pineapples in the field is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ hectares} \\times 100 \\text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \\text{ pineapples} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pineapples John can harvest in one month. Since he can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, the number of pineapples he can harvest in one month is:\n\\[ \\frac{1000 \\text{ pineapples}}{3 \\text{ months}} = \\frac{1000}{3} \\approx 333.33 \\text{ pineapples} \\]\n\nSince John can't harvest a fraction of a pineapple, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, John can harvest 333 pineapples in one month.\n\nFinally, to find out how many pineapples he can harvest in a year, we multiply the number of pineapples he can harvest in one month by the number of months in a year:\n\\[ 333 \\text{ pineapples/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 3996 \\text{ pineapples/year} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3996} \\]",
    "answer": "John has 100 x 10= <<100*10=1000>>1000 pineapples on his field.\nJohn can harvest his Pineapple 12 \u00f7 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 times per year\nTherefore John can harvest 1000 x 4 = <<1000*4=4000>>4000 pineapples per year.\n#### 4000"
