    "question": "On the first day of school, Ava sees that her friends Cole and Xavier have both grown a lot over the summer. Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer. What is the difference between Cole and Xavier\u2019s height now?",
    "completion": "To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert Xavier's height from inches to feet.\n2. Calculate Cole's current height.\n3. Find the difference between Cole's and Xavier's current heights.\n\nFirst, let's convert Xavier's height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Xavier's height in inches by 12:\n\n\\[ \\text{Xavier's height in feet} = \\frac{4 \\text{ feet}}{12 \\text{ inches}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate Cole's current height. Cole's height increased by 2 inches over the summer, so we add 2 inches to his original height:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cole's current height} = 50 \\text{ inches} + 2 \\text{ inches} = 52 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between Cole's and Xavier's current heights:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Cole's current height} - \\text{Xavier's height in feet} = 52 \\text{ inches} - \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nTo express this difference in inches, we need to convert 52 inches into feet and inches. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we can convert 52 inches into feet by dividing by 12:\n\n\\[ 52 \\text{ inches} = 4 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nSo, the difference in height is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 4 \\text{ feet} - \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ feet} = \\frac{12}{3} \\text{ feet} - \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ feet} = \\frac{11}{3} \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nTo convert this difference back into inches, we multiply by 12:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference in inches} = \\frac{11}{3} \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 4 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 48 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nTherefore, the difference between Cole and Xavier\u2019s height now is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]",
    "answer": "First, we need to be sure we are comparing the same units, so let\u2019s convert feet into inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So Xavier was 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 inches tall.\nXavier grew to be 48 + 3 = <<48+3=51>>51 inches.\nCole grew to be 50 + 2 = <<50+2=52>>52 inches.\nThe difference between Cole and Xavier\u2019s height is now 52 \u2013 51 = <<52-51=1>>1 inch.\n#### 1"
