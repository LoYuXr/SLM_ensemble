    "question": "An air conditioner cools a room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then it was turned up to high for 4 hours. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?",
    "completion": "To determine how many degrees lower the final temperature is compared to the starting temperature, we need to calculate the temperature change for each phase of the air conditioner operation and then sum these changes.\n\n1. **Initial Temperature:**\n   Let's denote the initial temperature as \\( T_0 \\).\n\n2. **Temperature Change with Low Air Conditioner:**\n   The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour on low. If the air conditioner runs for 3 hours, the temperature change is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ degrees/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n   So, the temperature after 3 hours is:\n   \\[\n   T_3 = T_0 - 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Temperature Change with High Air Conditioner:**\n   The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour on high. If the air conditioner runs for 4 hours, the temperature change is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ degrees/hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 12 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n   So, the temperature after 4 hours is:\n   \\[\n   T_4 = T_3 - 12 = (T_0 - 6) - 12 = T_0 - 18\n   \\]\n\n4. **Temperature Change with No Air Conditioner:**\n   The air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours, so there is no temperature change during this period. The temperature remains at \\( T_0 \\) after this time.\n\n5. **Final Temperature:**\n   The final temperature is the temperature after the last operation, which is \\( T_0 - 18 \\).\n\n6. **Temperature Difference:**\n   The final temperature is \\( T_0 - 18 \\). The initial temperature is \\( T_0 \\). The difference between the final temperature and the initial temperature is:\n   \\[\n   T_0 - (T_0 - 18) = 18\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final temperature is \\(\\boxed{18}\\) degrees lower than the starting temperature.",
    "answer": "The air conditioner ran for 3 hours on low, so the temperature dropped 2 * 3 = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees.\nIt then ran for 4 hours on high, so the temperature dropped another 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 degrees.\nIt was then turned off for 2 hours, so the temperature rose 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 degrees.\nThus, the final temperature was 6 + 12 - 4 = <<6+12-4=14>>14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\n#### 14"
