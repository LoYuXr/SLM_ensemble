    "question": "John decides to buy new phones for him, his 2 kids, and his wife.  Each phone after the first 2 is half price.  If the phone price is $600 how much did he pay for them all?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of the phones John bought, we need to consider the price of each phone and the fact that each phone after the first two is half price. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the price of the first phone:**\n   The first phone is priced at $600.\n\n2. **Identify the price of the second phone:**\n   The second phone is priced at half the price of the first phone. Therefore, the price of the second phone is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{600}{2} = 300\n   \\]\n\n3. **Identify the price of the third phone:**\n   The third phone is priced at half the price of the second phone. Therefore, the price of the third phone is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{300}{2} = 150\n   \\]\n\n4. **Identify the price of the fourth phone:**\n   The fourth phone is priced at half the price of the third phone. Therefore, the price of the fourth phone is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{150}{2} = 75\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   To find the total cost, we sum the prices of all four phones:\n   \\[\n   600 + 300 + 150 + 75 = 1125\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount John paid for all the phones is \\(\\boxed{1125}\\).",
    "answer": "He bought 1+2+1=<<1+2+1=4>>4 phones\n2 of the phones cost 600 so their cost is 2*600=$<<2*600=1200>>1200\nThe other two phones cost 600/2=$<<600/2=300>>300\nSo they cost 300*2=$<<300*2=600>>600\nSo the total cost is 1200+600=$<<1200+600=1800>>1800\n#### 1800"
