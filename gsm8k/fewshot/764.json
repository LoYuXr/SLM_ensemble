    "question": "Leila buys 3 cucumbers from the market. Cucumbers are $2 each. Jack buys 5 tomatoes from the grocery store.  Tomatoes are $1 each. Chase buys 1 head of lettuce from the farmer\u2019s market.  Lettuce cost $3 each. Together, how much did the three of them spend to make a salad for the potluck?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase to make a salad for the potluck, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the cucumbers:\n- Leila buys 3 cucumbers.\n- Each cucumber costs $2.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the cucumbers is \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the tomatoes:\n- Jack buys 5 tomatoes.\n- Each tomato costs $1.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the tomatoes is \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\) dollars.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the lettuce:\n- Chase buys 1 head of lettuce.\n- Each lettuce costs $3.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the lettuce is \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\) dollars.\n\nFinally, we sum the costs of all the items:\n- Total cost = cost of cucumbers + cost of tomatoes + cost of lettuce\n- Total cost = \\(6 + 5 + 3 = 14\\) dollars.\n\nThus, the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase to make a salad for the potluck is \\(\\boxed{14}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Leila spends 3 x $2 = $<<3*2=6>>6.\nJack spends 5 x $1 = $<<5*1=5>>5.\nChase spends 1 x $3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.\nTogether, they spend a total of $6 + $5 + $3 = $<<6+5+3=14>>14.\n#### 14"
