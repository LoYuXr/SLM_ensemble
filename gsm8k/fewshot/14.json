    "question": "In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance?",
    "completion": "To determine the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance.\n2. Determine the number of students remaining after subtracting those in contemporary dance.\n3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students.\n4. Determine the number of students remaining after subtracting those in jazz dance.\n5. Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance from the remaining students.\n6. Determine the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The number of students enrolled in contemporary dance is 20% of 20:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 20 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, 4 students are enrolled in contemporary dance.\n\n2. The number of students remaining after subtracting those in contemporary dance is:\n   \\[\n   20 - 4 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, 16 students are remaining.\n\n3. The number of students enrolled in jazz dance is 25% of the remaining 16 students:\n   \\[\n   0.25 \\times 16 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, 4 students are enrolled in jazz dance.\n\n4. The number of students remaining after subtracting those in jazz dance is:\n   \\[\n   16 - 4 = 12\n   \\]\n   So, 12 students are remaining.\n\n5. The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after subtracting those in jazz dance:\n   \\[\n   12\n   \\]\n   So, 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance.\n\n6. To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{12}{20} \\right) \\times 100 = 60\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is \\boxed{60}.",
    "answer": "There are 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.\nSo, 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 students are enrolled in either jazz or hip-hop dance.\nThere are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.\nHence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.\nThis is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.\n#### 60"
