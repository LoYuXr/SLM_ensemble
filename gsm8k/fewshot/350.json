    "question": "Peyton scheduled after-work activities of a one hour yoga class on Monday, a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday\u2019s yoga on Tuesday, a half-hour cheese-tasting event on Wednesday, a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class on Thursday, and two hours of errands on Friday. How many hours will all Peyton\u2019s after-work activities take?",
    "completion": "To determine the total time Peyton will spend on all her after-work activities, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Yoga class:**\n   - Duration: 1 hour\n\n2. **Cooking class:**\n   - Duration: 3 times the duration of the yoga class\n   - Duration: \\( 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\) hours\n\n3. **Cheese-tasting event:**\n   - Duration: 0.5 hours\n\n4. **Museum tour:**\n   - Duration: Half the duration of the cooking class\n   - Duration: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 = 1.5 \\) hours\n\n5. **Errands:**\n   - Duration: 2 hours\n\nNow, we sum up the durations of all the activities:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ hour (yoga)} + 3 \\text{ hours (cooking)} + 0.5 \\text{ hours (cheese-tasting)} + 1.5 \\text{ hours (museum tour)} + 2 \\text{ hours (errands)} = 7.5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time Peyton will spend on all her after-work activities is \\(\\boxed{7.5}\\) hours.",
    "answer": "Peyton\u2019s cooking class will last 3 * 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours.\nThe museum tour will take 3 / 2 = 1 1/2 hours.\nPeyton\u2019s after-work activities will take 1 + 3 + 1/2 + 1 1/2 + 2 = 8 hours in all.\n#### 8"
