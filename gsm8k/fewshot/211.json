    "question": "Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the number of red chickens Jerry has as \\( r \\) and the number of white chickens as \\( w \\). According to the problem, Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can write:\n\n\\[ w = r + 2 \\]\n\nEach red chicken produces 3 eggs per day, and each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs per day. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of eggs collected as:\n\n\\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( w = r + 2 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \\]\n\\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \\]\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 8r = 32 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 8:\n\n\\[ r = 4 \\]\n\nSo, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens:\n\n\\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \\]\n\nThen, we check the total number of eggs collected:\n\n\\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \\]\n\nThe calculations are correct, so the number of red chickens Jerry has is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
    "answer": "First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.\nThen, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2\nNow substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42\nNow multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42\nNow add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42\nNow subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32\nFinally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4\n#### 4"
