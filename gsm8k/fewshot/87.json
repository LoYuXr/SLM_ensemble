    "question": "A company pays each of its employees $600 in a month. The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years. If Sylvie just clocked 5 years in the company last December, what's her annual salary after three more years of service?",
    "completion": "To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Sylvie's initial salary:**\n   Sylvie has been with the company for 5 years. The company pays her $600 per month.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial salary} = 5 \\text{ years} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} \\times \\$600/\\text{month} = 60000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the annual increase:**\n   The company increases Sylvie's salary by 10% of her initial salary every year for the first 5 years. We need to calculate the salary after each year.\n\n   - **Year 1:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Salary after 1 year} = 60000 \\times 1.10 = 66000 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n   - **Year 2:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Salary after 2 years} = 66000 \\times 1.10 = 72600 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n   - **Year 3:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Salary after 3 years} = 72600 \\times 1.10 = 79860 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the annual salary after three more years:**\n   After the third year, Sylvie's salary will be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual salary after 3 years} = 79860 \\times 1.10 = 87846 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is \\(\\boxed{87846}\\).",
    "answer": "In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.\nSylvie earnings will increase by 10/100 * $7200/year = $<<10/100*7200=720>>720/year after 5 years.\nIn three years, the total increase in her salary will be 3 years * $720/year = $<<3*720=2160>>2160\nAfter three years, Sylvie will be paid $7200 + $2160 = $<<7200+2160=9360>>9360\n#### 9360"
