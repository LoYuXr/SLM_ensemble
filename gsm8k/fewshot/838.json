    "question": "Adam wants to eat some sliced apples. A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Adam decides to slice 3 large and 5 small apples and then eats 15 slices. How many apple slices are left?",
    "completion": "To determine how many apple slices are left after Adam eats some, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of slices from the large apples.\n2. Calculate the total number of slices from the small apples.\n3. Sum the slices from the large and small apples.\n4. Subtract the number of slices Adam ate from the total number of slices.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples:\n- Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.\n- Adam slices 3 large apples, so the total number of slices from the large apples is \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) slices.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples:\n- Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.\n- Adam slices 5 small apples, so the total number of slices from the small apples is \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\) slices.\n\nNow, let's sum the slices from the large and small apples:\n- The total number of slices from both the large and small apples is \\(15 + 15 = 30\\) slices.\n\nAdam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:\n- The number of slices left is \\(30 - 15 = 15\\) slices.\n\nTherefore, the number of apple slices left is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
    "answer": "There are 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 large apple slices.\nThere are 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 small apple slices.\nIn total, there are 15+15=<<15+15=30>>30 apple slices.\nAfter Adam eats 15 slices, there are 30-15=<<30-15=15>>15 apple slices remaining.\n#### 15"
