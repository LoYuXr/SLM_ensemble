    "question": "Each class in a school has 20 students. There are 3 classes. The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. How many boys are in the third class?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of boys in the third class, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of students in the school.\n2. Determine the number of boys in the first and second classes.\n3. Subtract the number of boys in the first and second classes from the total number of students in the school to find the number of boys in the third class.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of students in the school. Since there are 3 classes and each class has 20 students, the total number of students is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we know that the first class has 15 girls and 15 boys. Therefore, the number of boys in the first class is 15. Similarly, the second class has 12 girls and 12 boys. Therefore, the number of boys in the second class is 12.\n\nNow, we can find the number of boys in the third class by subtracting the number of boys in the first and second classes from the total number of students:\n\\[ 60 - (15 + 12) = 60 - 27 = 33 \\]\n\nThus, the number of boys in the third class is:\n\\[ \\boxed{33} \\]",
    "answer": "The school has 60 students because 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60\nThe school has 30 girls because 60 x .5 = <<60*.5=30>>30\nThe third class has 3 girls because 30 - 15 - 12 = <<30-15-12=3>>3\nThe third class has 17 boys because 20 - 3 = <<20-3=17>>17\n#### 17"
