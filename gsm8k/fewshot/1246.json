    "question": "Ara joined the school basketball team four years ago. She has been playing 40 games every year. If her score for every game is 21 points, calculate the total number of points she has scored in the four years.",
    "completion": "To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of games she played each year.\n2. Calculate the total number of points scored in each year.\n3. Sum the total points scored over the four years.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many games Ara played each year. Since she has been playing 40 games every year, we can calculate the number of games played in each year as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of games per year} = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of points scored in each year. Since each game is worth 21 points, we multiply the number of games by the points per game:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total points per year} = 40 \\times 21 \\]\n\nNow, let's perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[ 40 \\times 21 = 40 \\times (20 + 1) = 40 \\times 20 + 40 \\times 1 = 800 + 40 = 840 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of points scored in each year is 840. Since she has been playing for four years, we need to multiply the total points per year by 4:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total points over four years} = 840 \\times 4 \\]\n\nNow, let's perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[ 840 \\times 4 = 3360 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3360} \\]",
    "answer": "Forty games every year translates to 40*4 = <<40*4=160>>160 games in four years.\nIf Ara scores 21 points in each game, she has scored 160*21 = <<21*160=3360>>3360 points\n#### 3360"
