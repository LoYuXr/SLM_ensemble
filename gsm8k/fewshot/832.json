    "question": "Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than his brother Anthony.  Anthony has saved $10.00 more than their sister Eva.   Eva has saved $20.00.  How much money does Roy have?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Roy has saved, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Anthony's savings:**\n   - Eva has saved $20.00.\n   - Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Anthony's savings} = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Roy's savings:**\n   - Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony.\n   - To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   0.40 \\times 30.00 = 12.00\n   \\]\n   - Add this to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total savings:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Roy's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00\n   \\]\n\nThus, Roy has saved \\(\\boxed{42.00}\\).",
    "answer": "Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva who has $20.00 so he has 10+20 = $<<10+20=30.00>>30.00\nRoy has saved 40% more than his brother who has $30.00 so Roy has saved .40*30 = $12.00\nAll total, Roy has 12.00 more than his brother, so he has 12+30 = $<<12+30=42.00>>42.00\n#### 42"
