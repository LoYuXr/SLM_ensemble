    "question": "There are 220 castles in Scotland.  40 percent of them are ruins, and half of the ruined castles are unmanned.  How many unmanned ruined castles are there in Scotland?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of ruins in Scotland.\n2. Determine the number of unmanned ruins.\n3. Subtract the number of unmanned ruins from the total number of ruins to find the number of unmanned ruined castles.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of ruins.\nThere are 220 castles in Scotland, and 40 percent of them are ruins.\n\\[ \\text{Total number of ruins} = 220 \\times 0.40 = 88 \\]\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of unmanned ruins.\nHalf of the ruins are unmanned.\n\\[ \\text{Number of unmanned ruins} = \\frac{88}{2} = 44 \\]\n\nStep 3: Subtract the number of unmanned ruins from the total number of ruins to find the number of unmanned ruined castles.\n\\[ \\text{Number of unmanned ruined castles} = 88 - 44 = 44 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is \\(\\boxed{44}\\).",
    "answer": "Ruins:220(.40)=88\nUnmanned:88/2=<<88/2=44>>44 castles\n#### 44"
