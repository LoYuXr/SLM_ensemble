    "question": "Bethany can run 10 laps on the track in one hour.  Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.  Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.  Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.  How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of laps Bethany can run.\n2. Calculate the number of laps Trey can run.\n3. Calculate the number of laps Shaelyn can run.\n4. Calculate the number of laps Quinn can run.\n5. Determine how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn.\n\nFirst, we know that Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. So, the number of laps Bethany can run is:\n\\[ \\text{Laps Bethany can run} = 10 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany. So, the number of laps Trey can run is:\n\\[ \\text{Laps Trey can run} = 10 + 4 = 14 \\]\n\nThen, we know that Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey. So, the number of laps Shaelyn can run is:\n\\[ \\text{Laps Shaelyn can run} = \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\]\n\nFinally, we know that Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn. So, the number of laps Quinn can run is:\n\\[ \\text{Laps Quinn can run} = 7 - 2 = 5 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. This is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Laps Bethany can run} - \\text{Laps Quinn can run} = 10 - 5 = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, Bethany can run \\(\\boxed{5}\\) more laps compared to Quinn.",
    "answer": "Trey can run 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 laps in one hour.\nShaelyn can run 14 / 2 = <<14/2=7>>7 laps in one hour.\nQuinn can run 7 - 2 = <<7-2=5>>5 laps.\nBethany can run 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 more laps compared to Quinn.\n#### 5"
