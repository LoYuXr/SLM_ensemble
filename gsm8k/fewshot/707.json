    "question": "Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. If 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, what percent of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes?",
    "completion": "To determine what percent of the Colorado River's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total percentage of the Colorado River's water used by the city:**\n   The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.\n\n2. **Identify the percentage of the water used for industrial purposes:**\n   The city uses 80% of the water for industrial purposes.\n\n3. **Calculate the percentage of the water used for non-industrial purposes:**\n   To find the percentage of the water used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used for industrial purposes.\n   \\[\n   80\\% - 40\\% = 40\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the city uses 40% of the Colorado River's total water for non-industrial purposes.",
    "answer": "First find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes: 100% - 80% = 20%\nThen multiply that percentage by the percentage of water taken from the river: 20% * 40% = 8%\n#### 8"
