    "question": "Ryan\u2019s allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6.50 each. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money Ryan spent on his chores, ice cream cones, and movie tickets.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Ryan spent on his chores:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of money Ryan spent on ice cream cones:\n\\[ 1.25 \\text{ dollars/ice cream cone} \\times 3 \\text{ ice cream cones} = 3.75 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money Ryan spent on movie tickets:\n\\[ 6.50 \\text{ dollars/movie ticket} \\times 4 \\text{ movie tickets} = 26 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add up all these amounts to find the total amount of money Ryan spent:\n\\[ 18 \\text{ dollars} + 3.75 \\text{ dollars} + 26 \\text{ dollars} = 47.75 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the total amount of money he spent:\n\\[ \\frac{47.75 \\text{ dollars}}{6.50 \\text{ dollars/movie ticket}} \\approx 7.35 \\text{ movie tickets} \\]\n\nSince Ryan cannot buy a fraction of a movie ticket, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Ryan can buy 7 movie tickets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Ryan earned $6 x 3 weeks of chores = $<<6*3=18>>18.\nHe bought 1 for himself + 3 for his friends = <<1+3=4>>4 ice creams.\nThe ice cream cost $1.25 x 4 = $<<1.25*4=5>>5.\nRyan has $18 - $5 = $<<18-5=13>>13 left.\nWith the money he has left, Ryan can buy $13 / $6.50 = <<13/6.50=2>>2 movie tickets.\n#### 2"
