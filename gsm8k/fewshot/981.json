    "question": "On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.  He caught 4 times that amount on Friday and half the amount of his Friday's catch on Saturday.  If 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, how many servings does he have?",
    "completion": "To determine how many servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of crawfish Joe caught on Friday.\n2. Calculate the amount of crawfish Joe caught on Saturday.\n3. Sum the crawfish caught on Thursday and Friday.\n4. Convert the total amount of crawfish into servings.\n\nFirst, we know that Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount:\n\\[ 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nOn Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch:\n\\[ \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we sum the crawfish caught on Thursday and Friday:\n\\[ 3 + 12 = 15 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSince 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we convert the total amount of crawfish into servings:\n\\[ \\frac{15}{3} = 5 \\text{ servings} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of servings Joe has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]",
    "answer": "He caught 3 pounds on Thursday and caught 4 times the amount on Friday for a total of 3*4 = <<3*4=12>>12 pounds\nOn Saturday, he caught half the amount of the 12 pounds he caught on Friday so he caught 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pounds\nIn three days he has caught 3+12+6 = <<3+12+6=21>>21 pounds of crawfish\n3 pounds is a serving and he caught 21 pounds so he has 21/3 = <<21/3=7>>7 servings of crawfish\n#### 7"
