    "question": "Mary has 30 sheep. She gets 1 kg of milk from half of them and 2 kg of milk from the other half every day. How much milk does she collect every day?",
    "completion": "To determine how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of sheep that get milk from half of them.\n2. Calculate the total amount of milk collected from these sheep.\n3. Identify the number of sheep that get milk from the other half of them.\n4. Calculate the total amount of milk collected from these sheep.\n5. Add the amounts from both groups to get the total daily milk collection.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Mary has 30 sheep in total. Half of them get milk from half of them, and the other half get milk from the other half.\n   - Number of sheep that get milk from half of them: \\( \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\)\n   - Number of sheep that get milk from the other half of them: \\( \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\)\n\n2. Calculate the total amount of milk collected from these sheep:\n   - Milk from the first half of the sheep: \\( 15 \\text{ sheep} \\times 1 \\text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \\text{ kg} \\)\n   - Milk from the second half of the sheep: \\( 15 \\text{ sheep} \\times 2 \\text{ kg/sheep} = 30 \\text{ kg} \\)\n   - Total milk collected from the first half: \\( 15 \\text{ kg} \\)\n   - Total milk collected from the second half: \\( 30 \\text{ kg} \\)\n   - Total daily milk collection: \\( 15 \\text{ kg} + 30 \\text{ kg} = 45 \\text{ kg} \\)\n\nTherefore, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is \\(\\boxed{45}\\) kg.",
    "answer": "Half of the sheep is 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15.\nMary gets (15 * 1) + (15 * 2) = <<15*1+15*2=45>>45 kg of milk every day.\n#### 45"
