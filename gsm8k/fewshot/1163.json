    "question": "Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, how many face masks does he use every 2 days?",
    "completion": "To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of face masks Tyrion uses in one day.\n2. Calculate the total number of face masks Tyrion uses in two days.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many face masks Tyrion uses in one day. Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, then in one day he goes out 3 times. Since he changes his face mask twice for each trip, the total number of face masks he uses in one day is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ trips/day} \\times 2 \\text{ changes/trip} = 6 \\text{ face masks/day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many face masks he uses in two days. Since he uses 6 face masks per day, in two days he will use:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ face masks/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 12 \\text{ face masks} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Tyrion uses 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 face masks every day.\nTherefore, the total number of face masks he uses every 2 days is 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12.\n#### 12"
