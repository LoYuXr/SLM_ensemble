    "question": "Toula went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 3 dozen donuts which cost $68 per dozen, 2 dozen mini cupcakes which cost $80 per dozen, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes for $55 per dozen. How much was the total cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum these costs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:\n- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.\n- Each dozen donuts costs $68.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the donuts is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\text{ dozen} \\times 68 \\text{ dollars/dozen} = 204 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:\n- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.\n- Each dozen mini cupcakes costs $80.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the mini cupcakes is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ dozen} \\times 80 \\text{ dollars/dozen} = 160 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:\n- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.\n- Each dozen mini cheesecakes costs $55.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the mini cheesecakes is:\n  \\[\n  6 \\text{ dozen} \\times 55 \\text{ dollars/dozen} = 330 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:\n\\[\n204 \\text{ dollars} + 160 \\text{ dollars} + 330 \\text{ dollars} = 794 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost of the pastries is \\(\\boxed{794}\\).",
    "answer": "The total charge for the doughnuts was 3 x $68 = $<<3*68=204>>204.\nThe total charge for the mini cupcakes was 2 x $80 = $<<2*80=160>>160.\nThe total charge for the mini cheesecakes was 6 x $55 = $<<6*55=330>>330.\nTherefore the total amount Toula paid for the pastries was $204 + $160 + $330 = $<<204+160+330=694>>694.\n#### 694"
