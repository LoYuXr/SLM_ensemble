    "question": "James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.  He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour.  He swims 60% of the distance.  After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed.  How long did it take him to get across the lake?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it took James to swim across the lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps and calculate the time for each segment of his journey.\n\n1. **Calculate the distance James swims:**\n   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \\times 20 = 12 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the first 12 miles:**\n   James swims at a speed of 2 miles per hour.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for first 12 miles} = \\frac{12 \\text{ miles}}{2 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the time taken to rest:**\n   James rests for half the time it takes to swim the first 12 miles.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rest time} = \\frac{6 \\text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles:**\n   James swims at a speed of 2 miles per hour.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for remaining 8 miles} = \\frac{8 \\text{ miles}}{2 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total time taken:**\n   Add the time taken for swimming the first 12 miles, the rest time, and the time taken for swimming the remaining 8 miles.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = 6 \\text{ hours} + 3 \\text{ hours} + 4 \\text{ hours} = 13 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is \\(\\boxed{13}\\) hours.",
    "answer": "He swam 20*.6=<<20*.6=12>>12 miles.\nThat took him 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 hours.\nSo he rested 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours.\nHe then swam the remaining 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8 miles.\nHis pace was 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 mph.\nSo it took him 8/1=<<8/1=8>>8 hours.\nSo in total, he took 6+3+8=<<6+3+8=17>>17 hours.\n#### 17"
