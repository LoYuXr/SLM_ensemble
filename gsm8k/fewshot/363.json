    "question": "John drives to his friend's house 200 miles away.  He drives at a speed of 70 mph.  He had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip.  After he gets there he takes a route home that is 240 miles but he goes 80 mph.  How long did the trip take?",
    "completion": "To determine the total time taken for John's trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each segment of the journey separately and then sum these times.\n\n1. **Driving to his friend's house:**\n   - Distance: 200 miles\n   - Speed: 70 mph\n   - Time taken: \\(\\frac{200 \\text{ miles}}{70 \\text{ mph}} = \\frac{200}{70} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{20}{7} \\text{ hours} \\approx 2.857 \\text{ hours}\\)\n\n2. **Taking the detour:**\n   - Distance: 10 miles\n   - Speed: 70 mph\n   - Time taken: \\(\\frac{10 \\text{ miles}}{70 \\text{ mph}} = \\frac{10}{70} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{1}{7} \\text{ hours} \\approx 0.1429 \\text{ hours}\\)\n\n3. **Driving back home:**\n   - Distance: 240 miles\n   - Speed: 80 mph\n   - Time taken: \\(\\frac{240 \\text{ miles}}{80 \\text{ mph}} = \\frac{240}{80} \\text{ hours} = 3 \\text{ hours}\\)\n\nNow, we sum the times for each segment of the trip:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\frac{20}{7} \\text{ hours} + \\frac{1}{7} \\text{ hours} + 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\frac{20}{7} + \\frac{1}{7} + 3 = \\frac{21}{7} + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time taken for the trip is \\(\\boxed{6}\\) hours.",
    "answer": "The first leg was 200+10=<<200+10=210>>210 miles\nSo he drove 210/70=<<210/70=3>>3 hours\nThe second route took 240/80=<<240/80=3>>3 hours\nSo in total he drove 3+3=<<3+3=6>>6 hours\n#### 6"
