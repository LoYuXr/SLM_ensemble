    "question": "Deandre caught 3 tunas last Monday, the first tuna he caught weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna he caught weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna he caught weighs 26 kilograms. If a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, how much will he earn after selling all the tunas to the market?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of all the tunas Deandre caught.\n2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the tunas at the given price.\n\nFirst, let's find the total weight of the tunas Deandre caught:\n- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.\n- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.\n- The last tuna weighs 26 kilograms.\n\nAdding these weights together, we get:\n\\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \\text{ kilograms} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the tunas. Since each kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, the total revenue is:\n\\[ 128 \\text{ kilograms} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars per kilogram} = 64 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas is:\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]",
    "answer": "Deandre will earn 56 x $0.50 = $<<56*0.5=28>>28 from the first tuna.\nHe will earn 46 x $0.50 = $<<46*0.5=23>>23 for the second tuna.\nAnd he will earn 26 x $0.50 = $<<26*0.5=13>>13 from the third tuna.\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the tunas is $28 + $23 + $13= $<<28+23+13=64>>64.\n#### 64"
