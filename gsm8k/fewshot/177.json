    "question": "Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel and donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. He gives his daughter 200$ to use for her weekly expenses and 700$ to his wife to budget for groceries and other household goods. If Zaid earns 6000$ per month, how much money will he still have after all these expenses and donations?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount spent on rent.\n2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.\n3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.\n4. Calculate the amount donated to the charity.\n5. Determine the remaining amount after the donation.\n6. Subtract the amount given to his daughter and the amount given to his wife from the remaining amount.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Zaid spends \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of his salary on rent.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent on rent} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 6000 = 1500 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. Zaid spends \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of his salary on car fuel.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent on car fuel} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6000 = 2000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. The remaining amount after rent and car fuel is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount donated to charity} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2500 = 1250 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. The remaining amount after the donation to charity is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining amount after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. Zaid gives his daughter 200$ to use for her weekly expenses.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount given to daughter} = 200 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n7. Zaid gives his wife 700$ to budget for groceries and other household goods.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount given to wife} = 700 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n8. The total amount given to his daughter and wife is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 +",
    "answer": "When Zaid spend 1/4 of his salary on rent, he parts with 1/4*$6000 = $<<1/4*6000=1500>>1500\nCar fuel costs him 1/3*$6000 = $<<6000*1/3=2000>>2000\nTotal expenses amount to $2000+$1500 = $<<2000+1500=3500>>3500\nThe total amount of money he remains with is $6000-$3500 = $<<6000-3500=2500>>2500\nHe donates half of the remaining amount, which is 1/2*$2500 = $<<1/2*2500=1250>>1250\nThe total amount of money given to his wife and daughter is $200+$700 = $<<200+700=900>>900\nAfter the amount that he gave the wife and daughter, the total amount remaining is $1250-$900 = $<<1250-900=350>>350\n#### 350"
