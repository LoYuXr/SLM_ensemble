    "question": "John makes himself a 6 egg omelet with 2 oz of cheese and an equal amount of ham.  Eggs are 75 calories each.  Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.  Ham is 40 calories per ounce.  How many calories is the omelet?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of calories in John's omelet, we need to calculate the calories from each component of the omelet and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Omelet Calories:**\n   - The omelet consists of 2 oz of cheese.\n   - Each ounce of cheese contains 120 calories.\n   - Therefore, the calories from the cheese are:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ oz} \\times 120 \\text{ calories/oz} = 240 \\text{ calories}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Ham Calories:**\n   - The omelet also consists of 2 oz of ham.\n   - Each ounce of ham contains 40 calories.\n   - Therefore, the calories from the ham are:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ oz} \\times 40 \\text{ calories/oz} = 80 \\text{ calories}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Calories:**\n   - To find the total number of calories in the omelet, we add the calories from the cheese and the ham:\n     \\[\n     240 \\text{ calories} + 80 \\text{ calories} = 320 \\text{ calories}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of calories in John's omelet is \\(\\boxed{320}\\).",
    "answer": "The eggs contributed 6*75=<<6*75=450>>450 calories\nHe eats 2*120=<<2*120=240>>240 calories of cheese\nHe eats 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 calories of ham\nSo in total he eats 450+240+80=<<450+240+80=770>>770 calories\n#### 770"
