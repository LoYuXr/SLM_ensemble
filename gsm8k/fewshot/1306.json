    "question": "Dr. Hugo Grumpus and his assistant, Igor, were preparing to perform a laboratory experiment.  Dr. Grumpus told Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes, and to place them all on the lab bench.  By accident, Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.  And while he had picked up the correct number of beakers, he lost several on the way to the lab bench.  In total, the number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.  How many beakers did Igor lose?",
    "completion": "To determine how many beakers Igor lost, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of test tubes Igor should have gathered.\n2. Determine the number of Petri dishes Igor should have gathered.\n3. Calculate the number of beakers Igor lost.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many test tubes Igor should have gathered. According to Dr. Grumpus, he should have gathered 16 test tubes. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered:\n\\[ \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\text{ test tubes} \\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many Petri dishes Igor should have gathered. According to Dr. Grumpus, he should have gathered 14 Petri dishes. Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered:\n\\[ 14 + 2 = 16 \\text{ Petri dishes} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of beakers Igor lost. According to the problem, Igor lost several beakers on the way to the lab bench. The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench is 29. The number of items he lost is the difference between the total number of items and the number of items he actually had:\n\\[ 29 - 29 = 0 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]",
    "answer": "On the lab bench, there were half of the requested number of test tubes, or 16/2=<<16/2=8>>8 test tubes.\nOn the lab bench, there were 14+2=<<14+2=16>>16 Petri dishes.\nSince the remaining items on the bench were beakers, there were 29-8-16=<<29-8-16=5>>5 beakers on the lab bench.\nThus, Igor lost 7-5=<<7-5=2>>2 beakers.\n#### 2"
