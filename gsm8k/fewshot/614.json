    "question": "Gary does laundry twice a week. Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, and a gallon of water costs $0.15. How much does Gary spend on water for laundry in a year?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of water used per week.\n2. Calculate the total amount of water used per year.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the water used per year.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water used per week.**\n\nGary does laundry twice a week. Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water. Therefore, the total amount of water used per week is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ gallons/laundry} \\times 2 \\text{ loads/week} = 40 \\text{ gallons/week} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of water used per year.**\n\nThere are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the total amount of water used per year is:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ gallons/week} \\times 52 \\text{ weeks/year} = 2080 \\text{ gallons/year} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the water used per year.**\n\nEach gallon of water costs $0.15. Therefore, the total cost of the water used per year is:\n\\[ 2080 \\text{ gallons/year} \\times 0.15 \\text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \\text{ dollars/year} \\]\n\nSo, the amount Gary spends on water for laundry in a year is:\n\\[ \\boxed{312} \\]",
    "answer": "First multiply the number of times Gary does laundry per week by the number of weeks per year to find how many times he does it in a year: 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = <<2*52=104>>104 loads/year\nThen find how much each load of laundry costs: 20 gallons/load * $0.15/gallon = $<<20*0.15=3.00>>3.00/load\nThen multiply the cost of each load by the number of loads to find the total cost: $3.00/load * 104 loads = $<<3*104=312>>312\n#### 312"
