    "question": "Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving her friend some pomelos, Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. How many pomelos did Eve give away?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pomelos Eve gave away, we start by defining the total number of pomelos Eve originally had as \\( x \\). According to the problem, after giving away some pomelos, Eve is left with \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the original number of pomelos. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:\n\n\\[ x - y = \\frac{1}{4}x \\]\n\nwhere \\( y \\) is the number of pomelos Eve gave away. To solve for \\( y \\), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term in the equation by 4:\n\n\\[ 4x - 4y = x \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( y \\) by subtracting \\( x \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 4x - x - 4y = 0 \\]\n\\[ 3x - 4y = 0 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 3x = 4y \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( y \\), we divide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{3x}{4} \\]\n\nSince \\( y \\) must be a whole number (as you can't give away a fraction of a pomelo), \\( x \\) must be a multiple of 4. Let's denote \\( x \\) as \\( 4k \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Substituting \\( x = 4k \\) into the equation for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{3(4k)}{4} \\]\n\\[ y = 3k \\]\n\nThis means that Eve gave away \\( 3k \\) pomelos. To find the specific value of \\( k \\), we need to determine the original number of pomelos Eve had. Since the problem does not specify the original number of pomelos, we can assume the simplest case where \\( k = 1 \\), which gives \\( y = 3 \\). This means Eve originally had 4 pomelos and gave away 3 pomelos. Therefore, the number of pomelos Eve gave away is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]",
    "answer": "Eve is left with 20 x 1/4 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 pieces of pomelos.\nSo she gave away 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 pieces of pomelos to her friend.\n#### 15"
