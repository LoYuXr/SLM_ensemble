    "question": "Misha picks out 4 blouses from the 30% off rack.  The regular price for each blouse is $20.  How much is the total cost of the discounted blouses?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of blouses Misha picks out.\n2. Determine the regular price of each blouse.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the discounted blouses.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of blouses Misha picks out. The problem states that Misha picks out 4 blouses from the 30% off rack. Therefore, the number of blouses is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 0.30 = 1.2 \\]\nSince the number of blouses must be a whole number, we round 1.2 to the nearest whole number, which is 1. So, Misha picks out 1 blouse.\n\nNext, we determine the regular price of each blouse. The regular price for each blouse is $20.\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of the discounted blouses. The total cost is the number of blouses multiplied by the regular price of each blouse:\n\\[ 1 \\times 20 = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
    "answer": "Total regular price for the blouses is $20 x 4 = $<<20*4=80>>80.\nTotal discount on the blouses is $80 x 30% = $<<80*30*.01=24>>24.\nMisha paid $80 - $24 = $<<80-24=56>>56 for the discounted blouses.\n#### 56"
