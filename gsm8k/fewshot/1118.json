    "question": "In Tate\u2019s garden pond, there are 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes.  He buys 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.  How many more female fishes than male fishes does Tate have?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we need to calculate the total number of each type of fish and then find the difference between the two totals.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies:\n- Tate initially has 4 male guppies and buys 2 more, so he now has \\(4 + 2 = 6\\) male guppies.\n- Tate initially has 7 female guppies and buys 1 more, so he now has \\(7 + 1 = 8\\) female guppies.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of male and female goldfishes:\n- Tate initially has 3 male goldfishes and buys 2 more, so he now has \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) male goldfishes.\n- Tate initially has 5 female goldfishes and buys 3 more, so he now has \\(5 + 3 = 8\\) female goldfishes.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of each type of fish:\n- The total number of male fish is \\(6\\) (from the guppies) + \\(5\\) (from the goldfishes) = \\(11\\) male fish.\n- The total number of female fish is \\(8\\) (from the guppies) + \\(8\\) (from the goldfishes) = \\(16\\) female fish.\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the number of female and male fish:\n- The difference is \\(16 - 11 = 5\\).\n\nTherefore, Tate has \\(\\boxed{5}\\) more female fishes than male fishes.",
    "answer": "Tate has a total of 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 male fishes.\nHe has a total of 7 + 5 = <<7+5=12>>12 female fishes.\nAfter the purchases, he has 7 + 2 + 2 = <<7+2+2=11>>11 male fishes.\nAfter the purchases, he has 12 + 1 + 3 = <<12+1+3=16>>16 female fishes.\nIn his pond, there are this many more female fishes than male fishes 16 - 11 = <<16-11=5>>5 fishes.\n#### 5"
