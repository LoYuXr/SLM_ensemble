    "question": "Three teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend. Richie, the first teenager, scored 20 more goals than Mark and scored 45 more goals than Anna. If Richie scored 80 goals, how many goals did all three teenagers score?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna, we start by defining the number of goals each teenager scored. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Anna as \\( A \\). According to the problem, Anna scored 45 more goals than Mark, so Mark scored \\( A - 45 \\) goals. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so Richie scored \\( (A - 45) + 20 = A - 25 \\) goals.\n\nWe know that Richie scored 80 goals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ A - 25 = 80 \\]\n\nTo find \\( A \\), we solve the equation:\n\\[ A = 80 + 25 \\]\n\\[ A = 105 \\]\n\nSo, Anna scored 105 goals. Now, we can find the number of goals scored by Mark:\n\\[ A - 45 = 105 - 45 = 60 \\]\nSo, Mark scored 60 goals.\n\nNext, we find the number of goals scored by Richie:\n\\[ A - 25 = 105 - 25 = 80 \\]\nSo, Richie scored 80 goals.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:\n\\[ \\text{Total goals} = \\text{Goals scored by Anna} + \\text{Goals scored by Mark} + \\text{Goals scored by Richie} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total goals} = 105 + 60 + 80 = 245 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is \\(\\boxed{245}\\).",
    "answer": "If Richie scored 80 goals, which is 20 more goals than Mark, Mark scored 80-20 = <<80-20=60>>60 goals.\nThe combined number of goals scored by Richie and Mark is 60+80 = <<60+80=140>>140\nRichie also scored 45 more goals than Anna, which means Anna scored 80-45 = <<80-45=35>>35 goals.\nAll three teenagers scored 140+35 = <<140+35=175>>175 goals.\n#### 175"
