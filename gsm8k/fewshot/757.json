    "question": "Krissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool students. 11 students need size extra-small.  Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.  Half as many students need size large as size medium.  Six more students need size extra-large than large.  Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we will calculate the number of shirts required for each size category step by step.\n\n1. **Extra-small shirts:**\n   - There are 11 students who need size extra-small.\n   - Therefore, the number of extra-small shirts needed is \\(11\\).\n\n2. **Size small shirts:**\n   - There are twice as many students who need size small as extra-small.\n   - Therefore, the number of size small shirts needed is \\(2 \\times 11 = 22\\).\n\n3. **Size medium shirts:**\n   - There are four less students who need size medium than size small.\n   - Therefore, the number of size medium shirts needed is \\(22 - 4 = 18\\).\n\n4. **Size large shirts:**\n   - There are half as many students who need size large as size medium.\n   - Therefore, the number of size large shirts needed is \\(\\frac{18}{2} = 9\\).\n\n5. **Size extra-large shirts:**\n   - There are six more students who need size extra-large than size large.\n   - Therefore, the number of size extra-large shirts needed is \\(9 + 6 = 15\\).\n\nNow, we sum up all the shirts needed:\n\\[\n11 \\text{ (extra-small)} + 22 \\text{ (small)} + 18 \\text{ (medium)} + 9 \\text{ (large)} + 15 \\text{ (extra-large)} = 75\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is \\(\\boxed{75}\\).",
    "answer": "Krissa ordered 11 x 2 = <<11*2=22>>22 size small.\nShe ordered 22 - 4 = <<22-4=18>>18 size medium.\nShe ordered 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 size large.\nShe ordered 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 size extra-large.\nAltogether, Krissa ordered 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = <<11+22+18+9+15=75>>75 shirts.\n#### 75"
