    "question": "Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more likely Jerry is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row when rolling a six-sided die, we need to calculate the probabilities of these two events and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{number greater than 3}) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. The favorable outcomes for rolling two even numbers are (2, 2), (2, 4), and (2, 6). There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling two even numbers is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{two even numbers}) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 and two even numbers in a row. Since the events are independent, we multiply the probabilities of each event:\n\\[\nP(\\text{number greater than 3 and two even numbers}) = P(\\text{number greater than 3}) \\times P(\\text{two even numbers}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nThe probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 and two even numbers in a row is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 100 = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 and two even numbers in a row is \\(\\boxed{25}\\) percent.",
    "answer": "There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.\nThe chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.\nThe difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.\n#### 25"
