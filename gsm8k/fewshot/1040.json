    "question": "On Monday the post office delivered 425 letters. On Tuesday they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. On Wednesday they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. How many letters did the post office deliver Monday - Wednesday?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of letters delivered on Monday and Wednesday, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.\n2. Calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday.\n3. Sum the letters delivered on Monday and Wednesday.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many letters were delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is one-fifth of the number delivered on Monday plus 17. The number of letters delivered on Monday is 425.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of letters delivered on Tuesday} = \\frac{425}{5} + 17 = 85 + 17 = 102\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The number of letters delivered on Wednesday is twice the number delivered on Tuesday plus 5.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of letters delivered on Wednesday} = 2 \\times 102 + 5 = 204 + 5 = 209\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the letters delivered on Monday and Wednesday to find the total number of letters delivered over the three days.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of letters delivered} = 425 + 102 + 209 = 736\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of letters delivered on Monday and Wednesday is \\boxed{736}.",
    "answer": "Monday = <<425=425>>425 letters\nTuesday = (1/5) * 425 + 17 = <<(1/5)*425+17=102>>102 letters\nWednesday = 2 * 102 + 5 = <<2*102+5=209>>209 letters\nTotal = 425 + 102 + 209 = <<425+102+209=736>>736 letters\nThe post office delivered 736 letters on Monday - Wednesday.\n#### 736"
