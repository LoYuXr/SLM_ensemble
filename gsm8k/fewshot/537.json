    "question": "Four books are arranged on a shelf. The first book is 31 mm thick while the second book is 50 mm thick. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, and the fourth book is twice as thick as the first book. What is the total thickness of the four books?",
    "completion": "To determine the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book individually and then sum them up.\n\n1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.\n2. The thickness of the second book is 50 mm.\n3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ mm} - 5 \\text{ mm} = 45 \\text{ mm}\n   \\]\n4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 31 \\text{ mm} = 62 \\text{ mm}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:\n\\[\n31 \\text{ mm} + 50 \\text{ mm} + 45 \\text{ mm} + 62 \\text{ mm} = 188 \\text{ mm}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total thickness of the four books is \\(\\boxed{188}\\) mm.",
    "answer": "The third book is 50 - 5 = <<50-5=45>>45 mm thick.\nThe fourth book is 31 x 2 = <<31*2=62>>62 mm thick.\nThe total thickness of the four books is 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = <<31+50+45+62=188>>188 mm.\n#### 188"
