    "question": "Jane planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first week, it was 3 inches tall. It doubled in height the second week. It grew another 4 inches in the third week. How tall was the beanstalk after 3 weeks?",
    "completion": "To determine the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to follow the growth pattern step by step.\n\n1. **Initial height**: The beanstalk was 3 inches tall after the first week.\n2. **After the second week**: The height doubled. So, the height after the second week is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ inches} \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n3. **After the third week**: The height doubled again. So, the height after the third week is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ inches} \\times 2 = 12 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) inches.",
    "answer": "It was 3 inches tall after the first week.\nAfter the second week, it was 2 * 3 inches = <<2*3=6>>6 inches tall.\nAfter the third week, it was 6 inches + 4 inches = <<6+4=10>>10 inches tall.\n#### 10"
