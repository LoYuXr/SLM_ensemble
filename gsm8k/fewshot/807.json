    "question": "Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?",
    "completion": "To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.\n2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic he can make with the total number of chips.\n3. Convert the total number of square inches into inches.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has. He has two bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips:\n\\[\n2 \\times 72 = 144 \\text{ chips}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic he can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12:\n\\[\n144 \\div 12 = 12 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the length of the mosaic that Milo can make is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Milo has two bags of glass chips, so he has 72 * 2 = <<72*2=144>>144 chips.\nWith those, he can make 144 / 12 = <<144/12=12>>12 square inches of mosaic.\nThus, Milo can make his 3 inch tall mosaic 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 inches long.\n#### 4"
