    "question": "Ronnie was given $5 while Rissa was given thrice as much. After each of them had given an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. How much is left in Ronnie's money?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the amount of money Rissa received as \\( R \\). According to the problem, Rissa received thrice as much as Ronnie, so we can express this as:\n\n\\[ R = 3N \\]\n\nwhere \\( N \\) is the amount of money Ronnie received. The total amount of money given to both Ronnie and Rissa is $5, so we can write:\n\n\\[ N + R = 5 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( R = 3N \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ N + 3N = 5 \\]\n\\[ 4N = 5 \\]\n\\[ N = \\frac{5}{4} \\]\n\\[ N = 1.25 \\]\n\nSo, Rissa received $1.25. Now, we need to find out how much money each of them has left after giving an equal amount to their little sister. Let's denote the amount of money each of them has left as \\( x \\). Since they gave an equal amount to each other, each of them has \\( x \\) left. Therefore, the total amount of money left is:\n\n\\[ 2x \\]\n\nWe know that after giving an equal amount to each other, Rissa is left with \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) of her money. So, we can write:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{4}{5} \\times 1.25 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{5}{4} \\]\n\\[ x = 1 \\]\n\nSo, each of them has $1 left. Therefore, the total amount of money left is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\]\n\nThus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",
    "answer": "Rissa was given $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.\nAfter Rissa had given an amount to her sister, she has $15 x 4/5 = $<<15*4/5=12>>12 left.\nThis means she has given $15 - $12 = $<<15-12=3>>3.\nSince Ronnie had given the same amount as Rissa, then Ronnie is left with $5 - $3 = $<<5-3=2>>2.\n#### 2"
