    "question": "Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice and gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, if there are 25 kilograms of rice per sack, how many kilograms does she gave to her cousin and brother?",
    "completion": "To determine how many kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of sacks of rice Goldy bought.\n2. Determine the total amount of rice in kilograms.\n3. Calculate the amount of rice given to her cousin and brother.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of sacks of rice Goldy bought:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ sacks} - 3 \\text{ sacks} - 4 \\text{ sacks} = 13 \\text{ sacks} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of rice in kilograms:\n\\[ 13 \\text{ sacks} \\times 25 \\text{ kilograms per sack} = 325 \\text{ kilograms} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother. Since she gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, we add these amounts together:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ sacks} + 4 \\text{ sacks} = 7 \\text{ sacks} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total amount of rice given to her cousin and brother:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ sacks} \\times 25 \\text{ kilograms per sack} = 175 \\text{ kilograms} \\]\n\nSo, the total amount of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother is:\n\\[ \\boxed{175} \\] kilograms.",
    "answer": "Goldy gave a total of 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 sacks of rice to his brother and cousin.\nTherefore she gave 25 x 7= <<25*7=175>>175 kilograms of rice.\n#### 175"
