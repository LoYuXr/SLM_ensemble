    "question": "Charlie had 10 stickers. He bought 21 stickers from a store in the mall and got 23 stickers for his birthday. Then Charlie gave 9 of the stickers to his sister and used 28 to decorate a greeting card. How many stickers does Charlie have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of stickers**: Charlie starts with 10 stickers.\n2. **Stickers bought from the store**: Charlie buys 21 stickers from the store.\n   \\[\n   10 + 21 = 31\n   \\]\n   So, after buying the stickers, Charlie has 31 stickers.\n3. **Stickers received for birthday**: Charlie receives 23 stickers for his birthday.\n   \\[\n   31 + 23 = 54\n   \\]\n   So, after receiving the birthday gift, Charlie has 54 stickers.\n4. **Stickers given to his sister**: Charlie gives 9 stickers to his sister.\n   \\[\n   54 - 9 = 45\n   \\]\n   So, after giving stickers to his sister, Charlie has 45 stickers.\n5. **Stickers used to decorate a greeting card**: Charlie uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card.\n   \\[\n   45 - 28 = 17\n   \\]\n   So, after decorating the greeting card, Charlie has 17 stickers left.\n\nTherefore, the number of stickers Charlie has left is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",
    "answer": "The total number of stickers is 10 + 21 + 23 = <<10+21+23=54>>54.\nThe number of stickers given away and used on the greeting card is 9 + 28 = <<9+28=37>>37.\nCharlie has 54 \u2212 37 = 17 stickers left.\n#### 17"
