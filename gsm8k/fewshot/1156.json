    "question": "Linus works for a trading company. He buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price. If he bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, how much profit was he able to earn after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday?",
    "completion": "To determine Linus's profit, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the original price of one mobile device.\n2. Determine the selling price of one mobile device.\n3. Calculate the total cost for 2 devices.\n4. Calculate the total revenue from selling 4 devices.\n5. Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The original price of one mobile device is $20.\n2. The selling price of one mobile device is twice the original price, so it is \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) dollars.\n3. The total cost for 2 devices is \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) dollars.\n4. The total revenue from selling 4 devices is \\(4 \\times 40 = 160\\) dollars.\n5. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, so the profit is \\(160 - 40 = 120\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, Linus's profit is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",
    "answer": "The total cost for the devices he bought on Monday is 2*20= <<2*20=40>>40\nThe total cost for the devices he bought on Tuesday is 4*20 = <<4*20=80>>80\nThe total cost of these devices is 80+40= <<80+40=120>>120\nLinus sold each mobile device he bought for $20 x 2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.\nSo, he earned $40 x 2 = $<<40*2=80>>80 for the two devices he bought last Monday.\nAnd he earned $40 x 4 = $<<40*4=160>>160 for the 4 devices he bought last Tuesday.\nThe total amount of sales he made were worth 160+80 =<<160+80=240>>240\nLinus earned 240-120 =$<<240-120=120>>120\n#### 120"
