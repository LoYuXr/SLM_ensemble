    "question": "Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than can Brittany's phone.  The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.  If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo?",
    "completion": "To determine how many ducks Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo can hold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold.\n2. Use the information given to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold.\n3. Use the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold to find out how many ducks can be seen in her photograph.\n\nFirst, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. According to the problem, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Therefore, we can calculate the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = \\frac{\\text{Number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold}}{6} = \\frac{1800}{6} = 300\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Since Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo can hold 1800 photographs, we can find out how many birds there are by dividing the number of photographs by 50:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of birds} = \\frac{\\text{Number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold}}{50} = \\frac{1800}{50} = 36\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
    "answer": "Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos, which is 6 times more than Brittany's phone can hold, Brittany's phone can hold `1800/6=<<1800/6=300>>300 photographs.\nSince Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photos than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph, then 300/50=6 ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.\n#### 6"
