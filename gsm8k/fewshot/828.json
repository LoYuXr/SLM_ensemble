    "question": "Mulan has $40. Her father gave her $100. She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each and a bag for $20. How much money does Mulan have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Mulan has left after her purchases, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Mulan spent.\n2. Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money she had.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan spent. She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each and a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 30 + 20 = 60 + 20 = 80 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money she had. Mulan initially had $40. So, the amount of money she has left is:\n\\[ 40 - 80 = -40 \\]\n\nSince the result is negative, it means Mulan has $40 less than she started with. Therefore, the amount of money Mulan has left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{-40} \\]",
    "answer": "Mulan has a total of $40 + $100 = $<<40+100=140>>140.\nTwo pairs of jeans cost 2 x $30 = $<<2*30=60>>60.\nThus, Mulan spends a total of $60 + $20 = $<<60+20=80>>80.\nTherefore, Mulan has $140 - $80 = $<<140-80=60>>60 left.\n#### 60"
