    "question": "Matt wants cookies for a snack, but his dad wants him to eat healthily. He tells Matt he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, how many carrot sticks does he have to eat?",
    "completion": "To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.\n\nLet \\( c \\) be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. The number of cookies he wants to eat is half the number of carrot sticks he eats plus two extra for cleaning his room. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of cookies} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Number of carrot sticks} + 2 \\]\n\nSince Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we substitute 5 for the number of cookies:\n\n\\[ 5 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times c + 2 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( c \\), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 5 - 2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times c \\]\n\\[ 3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times c \\]\n\nNext, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \\( c \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 2 = c \\]\n\\[ c = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, Matt needs to eat \\(\\boxed{6}\\) carrot sticks.",
    "answer": "First subtract the two cookies Matt gets for cleaning his room from the total number he wants to eat: 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3\nThen double the number of cookies to find how many carrots sticks he has to eat: 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6.\n#### 6"
