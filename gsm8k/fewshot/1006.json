    "question": "The Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled. The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. How much will it cost to fill the pool?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the volume of the pool using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume} = \\text{width} \\times \\text{length} \\times \\text{depth}\n   \\]\n   Given the dimensions:\n   \\[\n   \\text{width} = 14 \\text{ feet}, \\quad \\text{length} = 25 \\text{ feet}, \\quad \\text{depth} = 4 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   So,\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume} = 14 \\times 25 \\times 4 = 1400 \\text{ cubic feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the volume by the cost per gallon:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost} = \\text{Volume} \\times \\text{cost per gallon}\n   \\]\n   Given the cost per gallon is $0.10:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost} = 1400 \\times 0.10 = 140 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost to fill the pool is \\(\\boxed{140}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Mr. Smith found the volume of the pool to be 14 feet wide x 25 feet long x 4 feet deep = <<14*25*4=1400>>1,400 cubic feet\nHe followed the pool company instructions and found his pool required 1,400 x 5.9 = <<1400*5.9=8260>>8,260 gallons of water.\nThe cost to fill the pool is $0.10 x 8,260 gallons = $<<0.10*8260=826>>826.\n#### 826"
