    "question": "In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night before going to sleep. In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. If she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, how many pages did she read in two weeks?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate the number of pages she read each week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night before going to sleep. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total number of minutes she read in the first week as follows:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 105 \\text{ minutes/week} \\]\nSince she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes by setting up the following proportion:\n\\[ \\frac{2 \\text{ pages}}{1.5 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{x \\text{ pages}}{105 \\text{ minutes}} \\]\nSolving for \\( x \\) (the number of pages she read in 105 minutes), we get:\n\\[ x = \\frac{2 \\text{ pages} \\times 105 \\text{ minutes}}{1.5 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{210 \\text{ pages}}{1.5} = 140 \\text{ pages} \\]\nSo, Judy read 140 pages in the first week.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the second week. She read a total of 100 pages in the second week.\n\nNow, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week to find the total number of pages read in two weeks:\n\\[ 140 \\text{ pages} + 100 \\text{ pages} = 240 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",
    "answer": "Every night, Judy reads 15 minutes/1.5 minutes = <<15/1.5=10>>10 sets of 2 pages.\nSo, she read 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 pages every night in the first week.\nIn the first week, she reads a total of 20 x 7 = <<20*7=140>>140 pages.\nTherefore, she read a total of 140 + 100 = <<140+100=240>>240 pages in two weeks.\n#### 240"
