    "question": "Gunter is trying to count the jelly beans in a jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. One says 80. Another says 20 more than half the first one. A third says 25% more than the first one. What is their average guess?",
    "completion": "To find the average guess of the friends, we need to calculate the guesses of each friend and then find the average of these guesses.\n\n1. The first friend's guess is 80.\n2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first friend's guess. So, we calculate half of 80 and then add 20:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the second friend's guess is 60.\n3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. So, we calculate 25% of 80 and then add it to 80:\n   \\[\n   0.25 \\times 80 = 20\n   \\]\n   Adding 20 to 80 gives:\n   \\[\n   80 + 20 = 100\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the third friend's guess is 100.\n\nNow, we add the guesses of all three friends to find the average:\n\\[\n80 + 60 + 100 = 240\n\\]\n\nSo, the average guess is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",
    "answer": "The second person guessed 60 because 20 + (80/2)= <<20+(80/2)=60>>60\nThe second guessed 100 because 80 x 1.25 = <<80*1.25=100>>100\nThe total amount guessed is 240 because 80 + 60 + 100 = <<80+60+100=240>>240\nThe average amount guessed is 80 because 240 / 3 = <<240/3=80>>80\n#### 80"
