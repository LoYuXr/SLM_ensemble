    "question": "Indras has 6 letters in her name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. How many letters are in Indras and her sister's names?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of letters in Indras' and her sister's names, we start by identifying the number of letters in Indras' name. Indras has 6 letters in her name.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. The problem states that her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. First, we calculate half of the letters in Indras' name:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{2} = 3\n\\]\n\nThen, we add 4 to this result to find the number of letters in her sister's name:\n\n\\[\n3 + 4 = 7\n\\]\n\nSo, Indras' sister's name has 7 letters. To find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:\n\n\\[\n6 + 7 = 13\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of letters in Indras' and her sister's names is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",
    "answer": "I = <<6=6>>6\nSister = 6/2 + 4 = <<6/2+4=7>>7\n6 + 7 = <<6+7=13>>13 letters\nTogether Indras and her sister have 13 letters in their names.\n#### 13"
