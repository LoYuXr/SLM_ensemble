    "question": "Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. If Cindy has four pets, how many total pets do the three have?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of pets Cindy has.\n2. Use the information about Marcia's pets to find out how many Marcia has.\n3. Use the information about Jan's pets to find out how many Jan has.\n4. Sum the number of pets each person has.\n\nLet's start with Cindy's pets:\nCindy has 4 pets.\n\nNext, we know that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy:\nMarcia has \\(4 + 2 = 6\\) pets.\n\nNow, we know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia:\nJan has \\(6 \\times 3 = 18\\) pets.\n\nTo find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has:\n\\[4 + 6 + 18 = 28\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pets that the three have is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",
    "answer": "Marcia has 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 pets.\nJan has 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 pets\nIn total, the three have 4 + 6 + 18 = <<4+6+18=28>>28 pets.\n#### 28"
