    "question": "Bob had 7 fish in his ornamental fish pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. He decided he wanted to get some more, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought at the pet store as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the number of orange fish he bought is \\( 3 + x \\).\n\nInitially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond. After buying \\( x \\) white fish and \\( 3 + x \\) orange fish, the total number of fish in his pond becomes:\n\\[ 7 + x + (3 + x) = 10 + 2x \\]\n\nThe pet store sold him 17 fish, so the number of fish he had left in his pond is:\n\\[ 10 + 2x - 17 = 2x - 7 \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, after buying the fish, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 3 + x = 2(3 + x) \\]\n\nNow, let's solve this equation step by step:\n\\[ 3 + x = 2(3 + x) \\]\n\\[ 3 + x = 6 + 2x \\]\n\\[ 3 + x - 6 = 2x \\]\n\\[ x - 3 = 2x \\]\n\\[ -3 = 2x - x \\]\n\\[ -3 = x \\]\n\nSo, Bob bought \\( x = 3 \\) white fish at the pet store. To verify, let's check the total number of fish after the purchase:\n\\[ 7 + 3 + (3 + 3) = 7 + 3 + 6 = 16 \\]\n\\[ 16 - 17 = -1 \\]\n\\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \\]\n\\[ 6 = 2 \\times 3 \\]\n\nThe calculations confirm that Bob bought 3 white fish. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]",
    "answer": "Bob started with 7 fish and bought seventeen, so he had 7 + 17 = <<7+17=24>>24 fish.\nLet x = the number of white fish.\nBob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so 2*x + x = 24 fish\n3*x = 24\nx = 24/3 = <<24/3=8>>8 white fish.\nBob started with 4 white fish, so he bought 8 - 4 = 4 white fish at the store.\n#### 4"
