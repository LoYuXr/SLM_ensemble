    "question": "Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night.  She buys cartons of ice cream with 15 servings of ice cream per carton at a cost of $4.00 per carton.  After 60 days, how much will she spend on ice cream?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream over 60 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of servings of ice cream Cynthia eats in 60 days.\n2. Determine the cost of the ice cream she eats.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of servings of ice cream Cynthia eats in 60 days. Since she eats one serving every night, she eats 60 servings in 60 days.\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the ice cream. Each carton contains 15 servings of ice cream, and each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the cost per serving is:\n\\[\n\\frac{4.00}{15} = \\frac{4}{15} \\text{ dollars per serving}\n\\]\nSince she eats 60 servings, the total cost for 60 days is:\n\\[\n60 \\times \\frac{4}{15} = 60 \\times \\frac{4}{15} = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream over 60 days is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Each container of ice cream has 15 servings and she eats 1 serving a night so after 60 days she will need 60/15 = 4 containers of ice cream\nIf each carton costs $4.00 and she needs 4 containers then it will cost her 4*4 = $<<4*4=16.00>>16.00\n#### 16"
