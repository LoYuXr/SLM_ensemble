    "question": "Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day.  A pack of gum has 15 pieces of chewing gum per pack.  How many packs of gum will he need to last him 30 days?",
    "completion": "To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will consume in 30 days.\n2. Determine how many packs of gum are needed to provide that total number of pieces of gum.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will consume in 30 days. Since he chews 4 pieces of gum a day, we multiply the number of days by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day:\n\n\\[ 4 \\text{ pieces/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 120 \\text{ pieces} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many packs of gum are required to provide 120 pieces of gum. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:\n\n\\[ 120 \\text{ pieces} \\div 15 \\text{ pieces/pack} = 8 \\text{ packs} \\]\n\nTherefore, Parker will need \\(\\boxed{8}\\) packs of gum to last him 30 days.",
    "answer": "He chews 4 pieces of gum a day so over 30 days he will chew 4*30 = <<4*30=120>>120 pieces of gum\nEach pack of gum holds 15 pieces and he needs 120 pieces for the month so he will need 120/15 = <<120/15=8>>8 packs of gum\n#### 8"
