    "question": "A tub of ice cream costing $13 is now sold at $11. A packet of milk was sold at a discount of $0.5. How much will you save if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk?",
    "completion": "To determine how much you will save by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then find the difference between the two.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream:\n- The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13.\n- The sale price of one tub of ice cream is $11.\n- Therefore, the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 13 = 26\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of 4 packets of milk:\n- The original price of one packet of milk is $0.5.\n- The sale price of one packet of milk is $0.5.\n- Therefore, the cost of 4 packets of milk is:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 0.5 = 2\n  \\]\n\nNow, we find the total cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:\n\\[\n26 + 2 = 28\n\\]\n\nTo find out how much you will save, we subtract the total cost from the original total cost:\n\\[\n13 - 28 = -15\n\\]\n\nSince the result is negative, it means you will actually spend $15 more than you would if you had bought 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original prices. Therefore, you will save $15.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The discount for each tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $<<13-11=2>>2.\nSo the discount for 2 tubs of ice cream is $2 x 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.\nThe total discount for 4 packets of milk is $0.5 x 4 = $<<0.5*4=2>>2.\nYou will save $4 + $2 = $6 for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.\n#### 6"
