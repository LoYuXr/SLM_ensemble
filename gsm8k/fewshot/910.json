    "question": "Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, and Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that. How many acres do the two farms have, together?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of acres on Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of acres on Farmer Brown's farm.\n2. Calculate the number of acres on Farmer Smith's farm.\n3. Add the number of acres on both farms together.\n\nFirst, we know that Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the number of acres on Farmer Brown's farm. We can express this relationship mathematically as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Acres on Farmer Smith's farm} = 2 \\times \\text{Acres on Farmer Brown's farm} + 100 \\]\n\nSubstituting the number of acres on Farmer Brown's farm into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Acres on Farmer Smith's farm} = 2 \\times 200 + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of acres on both farms together to find the total number of acres:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total acres} = \\text{Acres on Farmer Brown's farm} + \\text{Acres on Farmer Smith's farm} = 200 + 500 = 700 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of acres on both farms is \\(\\boxed{700}\\).",
    "answer": "Farmer Smith has 2*200+100=<<2*200+100=500>>500 acres.\nThe total is 200+500=<<200+500=700>>700.\n#### 700"
