    "question": "Adam bought himself some new trousers for $30. His mother gave him $6 for this purpose, and his father gave him twice as much. How much money did Adam have to contribute from his savings?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Adam contributed from his savings, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total amount of money Adam received from his mother and father.\n2. Subtract the amount received from his mother and father from the total amount Adam received from his trousers.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his mother and father:\n- Adam received $6 from his mother.\n- Adam received twice as much from his father as he did from his mother, which is $6 \\times 2 = $12.\n\nNow, we add the amounts received from his mother and father:\n\\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total amount received from his mother and father from the total amount Adam received from his trousers:\n\\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Adam contributed from his savings is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
    "answer": "Adam's father gave him $6 * 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.\nSo considering the price Adam needed to pay $30 - $12 - $6 = $<<30-12-6=12>>12 for his trousers from his savings.\n#### 12"
