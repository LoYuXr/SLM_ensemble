    "question": "Ellen decided to play a prank on her friend. She got a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself and left. Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, then Ellen's friend came along. What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?",
    "completion": "To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the probabilities involved.\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Ellen starts with 12 sodas.\n   - She shakes 3 sodas up.\n   - She takes 1 soda for herself.\n   - She leaves the 3 sodas shaken.\n\n2. **Shaking Process:**\n   - When Ellen shakes 3 sodas up, she gets 3 new sodas.\n   - She takes 1 of these 3 sodas for herself.\n   - She leaves the 2 remaining sodas shaken.\n\n3. **Taking Soda from Ellen:**\n   - Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas.\n   - The 1 shaken soda taken by Ellen's brother is now 2 sodas (1 shaken + 1 unshaken).\n   - The 2 unshaken sodas left by Ellen are now 2 sodas (1 shaken + 1 unshaken).\n\n4. **Final State:**\n   - Ellen's friend now has 2 sodas.\n   - The 2 sodas left by Ellen are now 2 sodas (1 shaken + 1 unshaken).\n\n5. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - The probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the probability that she takes one of the 2 sodas left by Ellen.\n   - The probability of taking one of the 2 sodas left by Ellen is \\(\\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\n6. **Final Probability:**\n   - The final probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\n7. **Expressing as a Percentage:**\n   - To convert the probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{6} \\times 100 \\approx 16.67\\%\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately \\(\\boxed{16.67\\%}\\).",
    "answer": "First figure out how many unshaken sodas were in the case when Ellen left the room: 12 total sodas - 3 shaken sodas - 1 taken soda = <<12-3-1=8>>8 unshaken sodas.\nNext, figure out how many unshaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 unshaken sodas.\nThen figure out how many shaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 shaken sodas.\nNow add the number of shaken and unshaken sodas to find the total number of sodas left when Ellen's friend came along: 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 sodas\nNow divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas to find the decimal probability Ellen's friend gets sprayed: 2/8 = <<2/8=0.25>>0.25\nNow multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .25 * 100 = <<.25*100=25>>25%\n#### 25"
