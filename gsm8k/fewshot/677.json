    "question": "Carol and Jennifer are sisters from Los Angeles who love collecting signatures from celebrities. During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After five weeks, Carol and Jennifer compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Carol has 20 signatures in her book, and Jennifer has 44. The sisters have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they decide they want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?",
    "completion": "To determine how many signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of signatures collected by Carol and Jennifer in the first five weeks:**\n   - Carol has 20 signatures.\n   - Jennifer has 44 signatures.\n   - Total signatures collected in the first five weeks: \\( 20 + 44 = 64 \\).\n\n2. **Determine the number of signatures needed to reach 100 signatures:**\n   - The sisters want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer.\n   - They have 3 more weeks of summer vacation.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of signatures needed in the remaining 3 weeks:**\n   - Total signatures needed: 100.\n   - Signatures already collected: 64.\n   - Signatures needed in the remaining 3 weeks: \\( 100 - 64 = 36 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of signatures needed by the end of the summer:**\n   - Total signatures needed: 100.\n   - Signatures already collected: 64.\n   - Total signatures needed: \\( 100 + 36 = 136 \\).\n\nTherefore, the sisters need to collect \\(\\boxed{136}\\) signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.",
    "answer": "Carol and Jennifer have already collected 20 + 44 signatures = <<20+44=64>>64 signatures.\nSince their goal is 100, they need to collect 100 - 64 signatures. 100 - 64 = <<100-64=36>>36 signatures\n#### 36"
