    "question": "Christina records her mood every day on a calendar. Over the past thirty days of moods, she had twelve good days and eight bad days and the rest were neutral. Her first eight days were good, her second eight days were bad, and her third eight days were neutral. If the next three days were good, neutral, and good, how many good days were left in the month?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of good days in the first 10 days.\n2. Calculate the total number of bad days in the first 10 days.\n3. Determine the total number of good days in the next three days.\n4. Subtract the total number of good days in the next three days from the total number of good days in the first 10 days to find the number of good days left.\n\nLet's start with the first 10 days:\n- Good days: 12\n- Bad days: 8\n- Neutral days: 3\n\nThe total number of good days in the first 10 days is:\n\\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of good days in the next three days:\n- Good days: 3\n\nThe total number of good days in the next three days is:\n\\[ 20 + 3 = 23 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of good days in the next three days from the total number of good days in the first 10 days to find the number of good days left:\n\\[ 20 - 23 = -3 \\]\n\nSince the number of good days cannot be negative, it means that the number of good days left in the month is 0. Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]",
    "answer": "Christina had 30 - 12 - 8 = <<30-12-8=10>>10 neutral days in the month.\nAfter the first three 8-day periods, she had 30 - 8 * 3 = 30 - 24 = <<30-8*3=6>>6 days of moods left.\nOf those days, 12 - 8 = <<12-8=4>>4 days were good.\nAfter the next 3 days with 2 good days, Christina had 4 - 2 = <<4-2=2>>2 good days left.\n#### 2"
