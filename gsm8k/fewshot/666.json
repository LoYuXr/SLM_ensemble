    "question": "Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. If Arelia has $120, how much would each have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money each person would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine how much money Kassidy has.\n2. Determine how much money Rayna has.\n3. Add the amounts of money each person has together.\n4. Divide the total amount of money by 3 to find out how much each person would have if they shared equally.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. We know that Kassidy has \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) times as much money as Aurelia. Since Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Kassidy's money} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 120 = 90\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the amounts of money each person has together:\n\\[\n\\text{Total money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360\n\\]\n\nFinally, we divide the total amount of money by 3 to find out how much each person would have if they shared equally:\n\\[\n\\text{Each person's share} = \\frac{360}{3} = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, if they decided to add together their money and share equally, each person would have \\(\\boxed{120}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Since Arelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money Arelia, Kassidy has 3/4*$120 = $<<3/4*120=90>>90\nThe total amount of, money Kassidy and Arelia have together is $90+$120 = $<<90+120=210>>210\nRayna has $60 more than Kassidy, and since Kassidy has $90, Rayna has $60+$90 = $<<60+90=150>>150\nThe three of them together has $210+$150 = $<<210+150=360>>360\nIf they decide to add up their money and share equally, each person would receive $360/3= $<<360/3=120>>120\n#### 120"
