    "question": "Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?",
    "completion": "To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all possible outcomes and their probabilities. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Normal Teacher's Turnaround:**\n   - There is a 50% chance that the normal teacher will collect the homework.\n   - There is a 50% chance that the normal teacher will give everyone an extension.\n   - There is a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.\n\n2. **Substitute Teacher's Turnaround:**\n   - There is a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will collect the homework.\n   - There is a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will give everyone an extension.\n   - There is a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.\n\n3. **Personal Extension:**\n   - There is a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework:\n\n- **Normal Teacher's Turnaround:**\n  - Probability of normal teacher collecting homework: 50% = 0.5\n  - Probability of normal teacher giving extension: 50% = 0.5\n  - Probability of Marcus getting extension: 20% = 0.2\n  - Total probability for normal teacher: 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.05\n\n- **Substitute Teacher's Turnaround:**\n  - Probability of substitute teacher collecting homework: 50% = 0.5\n  - Probability of substitute teacher giving extension: 50% = 0.5\n  - Probability of Marcus getting extension: 20% = 0.2\n  - Total probability for substitute teacher: 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.05\n\n- **Personal Extension:**\n  - Probability of getting personal extension: 20% = 0.2\n\nNow, we sum up all the probabilities to get the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:\n\n\\[ 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.2 = 0.3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to",
    "answer": "First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%\nThen find the chance the teacher doesn't grant the whole class an extension by subtracting the chance she does from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%\nThen find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%\nNow find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3\nNow multiply that probability by the probability Marcus can't get a personal extension to find the probability he actually has to turn in his homework: .3 * .8 = <<.3*.8=.24>>.24\nFinally, multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .24 * 100% = <<.24*100=24>>24%\n#### 24"
