    "question": "Morgan's dad said that she had $90 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf is $5. The Go-karts cost $10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?",
    "completion": "To determine how many friends Morgan can invite to her birthday party, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and then divide that by the budget Morgan has.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the activities:\n- Mini-golf: $5 per round\n- Go-karts: $10 per ride\n\nMorgan wants to play one round of mini-golf and ride the go-karts twice. So, the total cost for these activities is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ dollars/round} \\times 1 \\text{ round} + 10 \\text{ dollars/ride} \\times 2 \\text{ rides} = 5 + 20 = 25 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nMorgan's dad has a budget of $90 for the party. To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the total budget by the cost of the activities:\n\\[ \\frac{90 \\text{ dollars}}{25 \\text{ dollars/round}} = 3.6 \\]\n\nSince Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, she can invite 3 friends.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20\nEach person costs $30 because 5 + 5 + 20 = <<5+5+20=30>>30\nThree total people can attend because 90 / 30 = <<90/30=3>>3\nShe can invite 2 friends because 3 - 1 =<<3-1=2>>2\n#### 2"
