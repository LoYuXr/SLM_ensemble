    "question": "Fern is trying to decide between buying the Widgeteer 3000, which makes 60 widgets an hour, and the WidgetMaster 9000, which makes 45 widgets an hour. Each widget sells for $6. How much more money will Fern make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000 if it runs 24 hours a day for a month with 30 days?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total revenue for each widget maker over the given period.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each widget maker in a month.\n\n**Widgeteer 3000:**\n- Widgets per hour: 60\n- Hours per day: 24\n- Days in a month: 30\n\nTotal widgets per day = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day\nTotal widgets per month = 1440 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets/month\n\n**WidgetMaster 9000:**\n- Widgets per hour: 45\n- Hours per day: 24\n- Days in a month: 30\n\nTotal widgets per day = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1,080 widgets/day\nTotal widgets per month = 1,080 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets/month\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue for each widget maker over the month.\n\n**Widgeteer 3000:**\n- Selling price per widget: $6\n- Total revenue per month = 43,200 widgets/month * $6/widget = $259,200\n\n**WidgetMaster 9000:**\n- Selling price per widget: $6\n- Total revenue per month = 32,400 widgets/month * $6/widget = $194,400\n\nFinally, we find the difference in revenue between the two widget makers.\n\nDifference in revenue = Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000 - Revenue from Widgeteer 3000\nDifference in revenue = $194,400 - $259,200 = -$64,800\n\nSince the difference in revenue is negative, it means that the WidgetMaster 9000 will make more money than the Widgeteer 3000 over the month.\n\nTherefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the WidgetMaster 9000 compared to the Widgeteer 3000.",
    "answer": "First find how many more widgets the Widgeteer 3000 makes per hour: 60 widgets/hour - 45 widgets/hour = <<60-45=15>>15 widgets/hour\nThen multiply that difference by the number of hours in a day to find the daily difference: 15 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = <<360=360>>360 widgets/day\nThen multiply the daily difference by the number of days in a month to find the monthly difference: 360 widgets/day * 30 days/month = <<360*30=10800>>10,800 widgets/month\nThen multiply that number by the cost per widget to find the total earnings difference: 10,800 widgets/month * $6/widget = $<<10800*6=64800>>64,800\n#### 64800"
