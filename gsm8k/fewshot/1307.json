    "question": "James is putting together 4 tables.  Each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws.  He has 40 screws.  How many screws will he have left over?",
    "completion": "To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of legs needed for all 4 tables.\n2. Calculate the total number of screws required for all 4 tables.\n3. Subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws James has.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of legs needed for all 4 tables. Each table has 4 legs, so for 4 tables, the total number of legs is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ tables} \\times 4 \\text{ legs per table} = 16 \\text{ legs} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for all 4 tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so for 4 tables, the total number of screws is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ tables} \\times 4 \\text{ legs per table} \\times 2 \\text{ screws per leg} = 32 \\text{ screws} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws James has. James has 40 screws, so the number of screws left over is:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ screws} - 32 \\text{ screws} = 8 \\text{ screws} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of screws James will have left over is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Each table will take 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 screws\nSo he needs 8*4=<<8*4=32>>32 screws\nThat means he will have 40-32=<<40-32=8>>8 screws left over\n#### 8"
