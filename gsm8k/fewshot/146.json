    "question": "Johnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.  He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces.  How many blocks does Johnny pick up if he picks up all the legos?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of lego blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of blocks in each of the three lego boxes and then sum them up.\n\n1. The first box contains 500 pieces.\n2. The second box contains 3 times the number of pieces as the first box, which is \\(3 \\times 500 = 1500\\) pieces.\n3. The third box contains \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) the number of pieces as the second box, which is \\(\\frac{1500}{4} = 375\\) pieces.\n\nNow, we sum the number of pieces in all three boxes:\n\\[500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of lego blocks Johnny picks up is \\(\\boxed{2375}\\).",
    "answer": "The first set had 500 pieces, and the second set had 3 times as many as the first set, so the second set has 500*3=<<500*3=1500>>1500 pieces\nThe third set had one-quarter of the 500 pieces, so that means it had 500*.25= <<500*.25=125>>125 pieces\nIn total, that means Johnny picked up 500 + 1500+ 125= <<500+1500+125=2125>>2125 blocks\n#### 2,125"
