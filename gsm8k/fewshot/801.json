    "question": "At Ashley's school, they start a reforestation campaign where each child plants a tree and each teacher plants 2 trees. The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students and 3 teachers per class. How many trees will they have planted at the end of the campaign?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of trees planted at Ashley's school, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers separately, and then sum these two amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:\n- There are 40 classes.\n- Each class has an average of 25 students.\n- Therefore, the total number of students is \\(40 \\times 25 = 1000\\).\n\nSince each student plants one tree, the number of trees planted by the students is equal to the number of students, which is 1000.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:\n- There are 3 teachers per class.\n- There are 40 classes.\n- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \\(3 \\times 40 = 120\\).\n\nSince each teacher plants 2 trees, the number of trees planted by the teachers is \\(120 \\times 2 = 240\\).\n\nNow, we sum the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted:\n\\[1000 + 240 = 1240\\]\n\nThus, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is \\(\\boxed{1240}\\).",
    "answer": "40 classes participate in the campaign, representing a total of 40 * 25 = <<40*25=1000>>1000 students.\nWith 3 teachers per class, 40 * 3 = <<40*3=120>>120 teachers participate.\nWith one tree planted per student, 1000 * 1 = <<1000*1=1000>>1000 trees are planted per student.\nWith 2 trees planted per teacher, 120 * 2 = <<120*2=240>>240 trees are planted per teacher.\nAdding the trees planted by teachers and students, 1000 + 240 = <<1000+240=1240>>1240 trees will have been planted at the end of the campaign.\n#### 1240"
