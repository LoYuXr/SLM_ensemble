    "question": "Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. How old will Jerry be in 3 years?",
    "completion": "To determine Jerry's current age and then calculate his age in 3 years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Jerry's current age:**\n   Let \\( J \\) be Jerry's current age.\n\n2. **Express Jerry's age 5 years ago:**\n   Five years ago, Jerry was \\( J - 5 \\) years old.\n\n3. **Express Jerry's current age in terms of 5 years ago:**\n   Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write:\n   \\[\n   J = 2(J - 5)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( J \\):**\n   Expand and simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   J = 2J - 10\n   \\]\n   Subtract \\( J \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   0 = J - 10\n   \\]\n   Add 10 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   J = 10\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate Jerry's current age:**\n   Jerry is currently 10 years old.\n\n6. **Calculate Jerry's age in 3 years:**\n   Add 3 years to Jerry's current age:\n   \\[\n   10 + 3 = 13\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jerry will be \\(\\boxed{13}\\) years old in 3 years.",
    "answer": "We know that Jerry's Age/2 = Jerry's Age - 5\nTherefore Jerry's Age = 2 Jerry's age - 10\nTherefore -Jerry's Age = - 10\nTherefore Jerry's Age = <<10=10>>10\nIn three years Jerry will be 13 because 10 + 3 = <<10+3=13>>13\n#### 13"
