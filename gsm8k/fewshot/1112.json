    "question": "Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. Peter wants a quarter of that and Paul wants 1/3 of that. How many kilograms will James have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how many kilograms of apples James will have left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of apples each person wants.\n2. Subtract the total amount of apples they want from the total amount they bought.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much apples each person wants:\n- Peter wants a quarter of the total amount of apples.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Peter's share} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 \\text{ kg} = 3 \\text{ kg}\n  \\]\n- Paul wants 1/3 of the total amount of apples.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Paul's share} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 \\text{ kg} = 4 \\text{ kg}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of apples they want to buy:\n\\[\n\\text{Total apples wanted} = \\text{Peter's share} + \\text{Paul's share} = 3 \\text{ kg} + 4 \\text{ kg} = 7 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total amount of apples they want from the total amount they bought:\n\\[\n\\text{Apples left} = 12 \\text{ kg} - 7 \\text{ kg} = 5 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of kilograms of apples James will have left is \\boxed{5}.",
    "answer": "Peter wants 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 kg of apples.\nPaul wants 12 * 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 kg of apples.\nTogether, Peter and Paul want a total of 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 kg of apples.\nSo James will have 12 - 7 = <<12-7=5>>5 kg.\n#### 5"
