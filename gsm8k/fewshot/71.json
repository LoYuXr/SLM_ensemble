    "question": "Kelian has two recipes for preparing dishes, one having 20 instructions and the second one having twice as many instructions as the first one. How many instructions does Kelian have to read to prepare the two dishes?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of instructions Kelian needs to read to prepare both dishes, we start by identifying the number of instructions in each recipe.\n\nFirst, we know that the first recipe has 20 instructions. Let's denote the number of instructions in the first recipe as \\( x \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ x = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we are told that the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first recipe. So, the number of instructions in the second recipe is:\n\\[ 2x = 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of instructions for both recipes. We add the number of instructions in the first recipe to the number of instructions in the second recipe:\n\\[ x + 2x = 20 + 40 = 60 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare both dishes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]",
    "answer": "The second recipe has 2 * 20 instructions = <<2*20=40>>40 instructions.\nThe total for the two dishes is 40 instructions + 20 instructions = <<40+20=60>>60 instructions.\n#### 60"
