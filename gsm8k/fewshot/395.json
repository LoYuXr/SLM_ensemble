    "question": "Erica made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out.  Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each.  She passed out 24 to her classmates, 5 to her family and received 17 from family and friends.  How many Valentine's Day cards does Erica now have?",
    "completion": "To determine how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica's dad brought.\n2. Determine the total number of Valentine's cards Erica received from her family.\n3. Add the cards from the cards she passed out to her classmates, family, and friends.\n4. Subtract the number of cards she passed out from the total number of cards she received.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Erica's dad brought 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, and each box had 15 cards. So, the total number of cards from her dad is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 15 = 30\n   \\]\n\n2. Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates, 5 cards to her family, and received 17 cards from her family and friends. So, the total number of cards she received is:\n   \\[\n   24 + 5 + 17 = 46\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we add the cards from the cards she passed out to her classmates, family, and friends to the cards she received from her dad:\n   \\[\n   46 + 30 = 76\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, we subtract the number of cards she passed out from the total number of cards she received:\n   \\[\n   76 - 20 = 56\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{56}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Her dad gave her 2 boxes of 15 cards so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30\nShe made 20, was given 30 and received 17 so 20+30+17 = <<20+30+17=67>>67 cards\nShe passed out 24 and gave 5 cards to family and friends so she gave away 24+5 = <<24+5=29>>29 cards\nShe had 67 cards and gave away 29 cards so 67-29 = <<67-29=38>>38 cards left\n#### 38"
