    "question": "Millie decides to open a lemonade stand. She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?",
    "completion": "To determine the profit Millie will make per hour, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade sold.\n2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lemonade.\n3. Calculate the profit per hour.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade sold.**\n\nMillie has 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ pitchers} \\times 12 \\text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lemonade.**\n\nMillie sells each cup of lemonade for $1. Therefore, the total revenue is:\n\\[ 36 \\text{ cups} \\times 1 \\text{ dollar per cup} = 36 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the profit per hour.**\n\nMillie sells all the lemonade, so the profit per hour is the total revenue divided by the number of hours she spends running the lemonade stand. Since the problem does not specify the number of hours she spends, we assume she spends the entire time running the lemonade stand. Therefore, the profit per hour is:\n\\[ \\frac{36 \\text{ dollars}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = 36 \\text{ dollars per hour} \\]\n\nThus, the profit Millie will make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]",
    "answer": "She has enough supplies to make 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 cups of lemonade.\nShe sells all of the lemonade for 36 * $1 = $<<36*1=36>>36.\nHer total profit for selling the lemonade is $36 - $18 = $<<36-18=18>>18.\nIt will take Millie 36 / 4 = <<36/4=9>>9 hours of work to sell all of the lemonade.\nHer hourly profit is $18 / 9 hours = $<<18/9=2>>2 per hour.\n#### 2"
