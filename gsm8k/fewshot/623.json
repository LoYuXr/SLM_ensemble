    "question": "Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. How old will she be 4 years from now?",
    "completion": "To determine how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine Charmaine's current age.\n2. Calculate her age 4 years from now.\n\nFirst, we know that in 12 years, Charmaine will be 16 years old. Therefore, her current age is:\n\\[ 16 - 12 = 4 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now. Since she is currently 4 years old, adding 4 years to her current age will give us:\n\\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nSo, Charmaine will be \\(\\boxed{8}\\) years old 4 years from now.",
    "answer": "Charmaine's present age is 16 - 12 = <<16-12=4>>4 years old.\nSo she will be 4 + 4 = <<4+4=8>>8 years old 4 years from now.\n#### 8"
