    "question": "Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \\( x \\). According to the problem, in the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, which means he retrieved \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) balls in the third set.\n\nThe total number of tennis balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ x + x + \\frac{x}{2} = 19 \\]\n\nCombining the terms on the left side, we get:\n\n\\[ 2x + \\frac{x}{2} = 19 \\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:\n\n\\[ 4x + x = 38 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 5x = 38 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{38}{5} = 7.6 \\]\n\nSince the number of balls must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem statement and the context. However, if we assume the problem is correctly stated and we need to find the closest whole number solution, we can round 7.6 to the nearest whole number, which is 8. Let's check if \\( x = 8 \\) fits the equation:\n\nIf \\( x = 8 \\), then the number of balls in the third set is \\( \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\).\n\nSo, the total number of balls in the first two sets is:\n\n\\[ 8 + 8 + 4 = 20 \\]\n\nThis leaves us with:\n\n\\[ 19 - 20 = -1 \\]\n\nThis indicates a potential error in the problem setup or interpretation.

    "answer": "Let B be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the third set.\nIn the second set, he retrieved 2B balls.\nIn the first set, he retrieved 2B + 4 balls.\nIn total, he retrieved B + 2B + 2B + 4 = 5B + 4 = 19 balls.\nThus, 5B = 19 - 4 = 15 balls.\nTherefore, in the third set, Rory retrieved B = 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 balls.\nHence, in the second set, he retrieved 2B = 3 * 2 = 6 balls.\nIn the first set he retrieved 2(3) + 4 balls = 10\n#### 10"
