    "question": "A man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. How many sandwiches does this family eat in one week?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of sandwiches and then multiply by the number of days in a week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily consumption of sandwiches for the man, his wife, and their son:\n- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.\n- His wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.\n- Their son eats 2 sandwiches per day.\n\nAdding these together, the total daily consumption is:\n\\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \\text{ sandwiches per day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many sandwiches are consumed in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:\n\\[ 11 \\times 7 = 77 \\text{ sandwiches per week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the family eats \\(\\boxed{77}\\) sandwiches in one week.",
    "answer": "The number of sandwiches they eat in one day is 5 + 4 + 2 = <<5+4+2=11>>11 sandwiches.\nThe number of sandwiches they eat in a week is 11 * 7 = <<11*7=77>>77 sandwiches.\n#### 77"
