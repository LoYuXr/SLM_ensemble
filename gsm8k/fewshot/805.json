    "question": "James buys a ring for his bride-to-be.  The diamond cost $600 and the gold cost $300.  He pays a 30% premium for it to be made.  How much did he pay?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount James paid for the ring, we need to consider both the cost of the diamond and the gold, as well as the premium he paid for the ring to be made.\n\n1. **Cost of the diamond:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of the diamond} = \\$600\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cost of the gold:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of the gold} = \\$300\n   \\]\n\n3. **Premium for the ring:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Premium} = 30\\% \\text{ of the cost of the diamond}\n   \\]\n   First, calculate 30% of the cost of the diamond:\n   \\[\n   30\\% \\text{ of } \\$600 = 0.30 \\times \\$600 = \\$180\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total cost:**\n   Add the cost of the diamond, the cost of the gold, and the premium:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\$600 + \\$300 + \\$180 = \\$1080\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount James paid for the ring is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1080}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The material cost 600+300=$<<600+300=900>>900\nThe premium came out to 900*.3=$<<900*.3=270>>270\nSo the total cost was 900+270=$<<900+270=1170>>1170\n#### 1170"
