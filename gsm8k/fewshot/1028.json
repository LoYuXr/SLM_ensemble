    "question": "Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000.  He sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that to pay for part of the bedroom set.  He then has to pay 10% a month for the bedroom set.  How much does he have to pay per month?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount Tom has after selling his old bedroom:**\n   - Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000.\n   - He sells his old bedroom for $1000.\n   - After selling the old bedroom, Tom has:\n     \\[\n     3000 - 1000 = 2000 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the monthly payment for the bedroom set:**\n   - Tom has $2000 to pay for the bedroom set.\n   - He has to pay 10% of the bedroom set each month.\n   - The monthly payment for the bedroom set is:\n     \\[\n     0.10 \\times 2000 = 200 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Tom has to pay \\(\\boxed{200}\\) dollars per month.",
    "answer": "He has to pay 3000-1000=$<<3000-1000=2000>>2000\nSo he has to pay 2000*.1=$<<2000*.1=200>>200 per month\n#### 200"
