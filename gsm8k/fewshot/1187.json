    "question": "Jay is making snowballs to prepare for a snowball fight with his sister. He can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. How long will it take before he has 60 snowballs?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs, we need to account for the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the rate of snowball building:**\n   Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. Therefore, his rate of snowball building is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20 \\text{ snowballs}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = 20 \\text{ snowballs per hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the rate of snowball melting:**\n   Jay melts 2 snowballs every 15 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the rate of melting is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2 \\text{ snowballs}}{15 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{2}{15} \\text{ snowballs per minute}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the net rate of snowball production:**\n   The net rate of snowball production is the rate of building snowballs minus the rate of melting snowballs:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ snowballs per hour} - \\frac{2}{15} \\text{ snowballs per minute} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 20 \\text{ snowballs per hour} - \\frac{120}{15} \\text{ snowballs per hour} = 20 \\text{ snowballs per hour} - 8 \\text{ snowballs per hour} = 12 \\text{ snowballs per hour}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the time required to build 60 snowballs:**\n   Since Jay's net rate of snowball production is 12 snowballs per hour, the time required to build 60 snowballs is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60 \\text{ snowballs}}{12 \\text{ snowballs per hour}} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jay \\boxed{5} hours to build 60 snowballs.",
    "answer": "Every hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs.\nAt the same time, each hour 2 * 60/15 = <<2*60/15=8>>8 snowballs melt.\nThis means that each hour, Jay ends up with 20 \u2013 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 more snowballs.\nIt will take Jay 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 hours to create enough snowballs.\n#### 5"
