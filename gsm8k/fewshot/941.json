    "question": "There are 29 pupils in a class. The teacher has 9 coupons; each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. The teacher gives each student 2 bottles of apple juice to drink for lunch. After redeeming all her coupons and giving each student their apple juice lunch, how many bottles of apple juice does the teacher have for herself?",
    "completion": "To determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice that the teacher gives to the students.\n2. Determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left after giving some to the students.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students. Since there are 29 pupils and each pupil gets 2 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles given is:\n\\[ 29 \\times 2 = 58 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left after giving some to the students. The teacher initially has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has is:\n\\[ 9 \\times 100 = 900 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nAfter giving 58 bottles to the students, the teacher has:\n\\[ 900 - 58 = 842 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nThus, the teacher has \\(\\boxed{842}\\) bottles of apple juice for herself.",
    "answer": "The teacher can redeem her coupons for 9 * 100 = <<9*100=900>>900 bottles of apple juice.\nIn total, the pupils receive 29 * 2 = <<29*2=58>>58 bottles of apple juice from the teacher.\nThus the teacher has 900 - 58 = <<900-58=842>>842 bottles of apple juice for herself.\n#### 842"
