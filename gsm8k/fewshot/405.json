    "question": "Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game.  Each sandwich required 1 pound each of meat and cheese and would serve 4 people.  There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese to make enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of meat needed:**\n   Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat. Since Tyson needs to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people, we need to determine how many sandwiches are required.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of sandwiches} = \\frac{20 \\text{ people}}{4 \\text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \\text{ sandwiches}\n   \\]\n   Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat, the total amount of meat needed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total meat needed} = 5 \\text{ sandwiches} \\times 1 \\text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \\text{ pounds of meat}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of cheese needed:**\n   Each sandwich requires 1 pound of cheese. Since Tyson needs to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people, we need to determine how many sandwiches are required.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of sandwiches} = \\frac{20 \\text{ people}}{4 \\text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \\text{ sandwiches}\n   \\]\n   Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of cheese, the total amount of cheese needed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cheese needed} = 5 \\text{ sandwiches} \\times 1 \\text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \\text{ pounds of cheese}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**\n   The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for the meat is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of meat} = 5 \\text{ pounds of meat} \\times \\$7.00 \\text{ per pound} = \\$35.00\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**\n   The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for the cheese is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \\text{ pounds of cheese} \\times \\$3.00 \\text{ per pound} = \\$15.00\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   The total cost for the meat and",
    "answer": "Each sandwich serves 4 people and he had 20 people in total to make food for so 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 sandwiches\n1 pound of meat cost $7.00 per sandwich and he had to make 5 so 7*5 = $<<7*5=35.00>>35.00 for meat\n1 pound of cheese cost $3.00 per sandwich and he had to make 5 so 3*5 = $<<3*5=15.00>>15.00 for cheese\nWhen you add the meat and cheese together, he would spend 35+15 = $<<35+15=50.00>>50.00\n#### 50"
