    "question": "Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. If Duncan's age is 60 now, how old will Adam be in 8 years?",
    "completion": "To solve the problem, we need to determine Adam's current age and then find out how old Adam will be in 8 years.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- Let \\( D \\) be Duncan's current age.\n- Let \\( A \\) be Adam's current age.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1. Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.\n2. Duncan's current age is 60.\n\nUsing the information from the first point, we can write the equation:\n\\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \\]\n\nUsing the information from the second point, we can write the equation:\n\\[ D = 60 \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( D = 60 \\) into the first equation:\n\\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \\]\n\\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \\]\n\nNext, solve for \\( A \\):\n\\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \\]\n\\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \\]\n\\[ 60 = 2A \\]\n\\[ A = 30 \\]\n\nSo, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:\n\\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \\]\n\nTherefore, Adam will be \\(\\boxed{38}\\) years old in 8 years.",
    "answer": "Eight years ago, Duncan was 60-8 = 52 years old, the same as Adam's age four years ago.\nTherefore, four years ago, Adam's age was 52/2 =<<52/2=26>>26 years.\nCurrently, Adam is 26+4 = <<26+4=30>>30 years old.\nIn 8 years from now, Adam will be 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 years old.\n#### 38"
