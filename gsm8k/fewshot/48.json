    "question": "Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. The wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long. How many pieces did she obtain?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pieces of wire Tracy obtained, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches:**\n   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply the total length of the wire in feet by 12.\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 48 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from 48 inches:**\n   We divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece of wire.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{48 \\text{ inches}}{6 \\text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Tracy obtained \\(\\boxed{8}\\) pieces of wire.",
    "answer": "If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.\nSince the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long, Tracy obtained 48/6=<<48/6=8>>8 pieces\n#### 8"
