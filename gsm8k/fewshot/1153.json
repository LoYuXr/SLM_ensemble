    "question": "Carlos, Jim and Carrey were at the beach playing and they decided to gather some seashells. Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. How many did each person get?",
    "completion": "To determine how many seashells each person got, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine how many seashells Carlos collected:**\n   Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. Let \\( C \\) represent the number of seashells Carlos collected. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   C = 27 + 5\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   C = 32\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many seashells Carrey collected:**\n   Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Let \\( K \\) represent the number of seashells Carrey collected. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   K = 2C\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( C = 32 \\) into the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   K = 2 \\times 32 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of seashells collected by all three:**\n   The total number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey is:\n   \\[\n   27 + 32 + 64 = 123\n   \\]\n\n4. **Divide the total number of seashells equally among the three:**\n   To find out how many seashells each person got, we divide the total number of seashells by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{123}{3} = 41\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each person got \\(\\boxed{41}\\) seashells.",
    "answer": "Jim collected 27 seashells, 5 more than what Carlos collected, which means Carlos collected 27-5 = <<27-5=22>>22 seashells\nCarlos collected twice as many as Carrey did, meaning Carrey collected 22/2 = <<22/2=11>>11 seashells\nIn total, they collected 27+22+11 = <<27+22+11=60>>60 seashells\nThey divided them into three equal group, getting 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 each\n#### 20"
