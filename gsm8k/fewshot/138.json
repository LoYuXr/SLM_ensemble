    "question": "Mark took a test yesterday that consisted of 75 questions. He completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Today, he took another test of 100 questions at the same rate. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second one, how many questions did he leave incomplete?",
    "completion": "To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed and then subtract that from the total number of questions in the second test.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test. He completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Since he had 8 hours to complete the first test, the total number of questions he completed in the first test is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ questions/hour} \\times 8 \\text{ hours} = 40 \\text{ questions}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test. He completed the test at the same rate of 5 questions per hour, and he had 6 hours to complete the second test. The total number of questions he completed in the second test is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ questions/hour} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ questions}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of questions completed in both tests to find the total number of questions Mark completed:\n\\[\n40 \\text{ questions} + 30 \\text{ questions} = 70 \\text{ questions}\n\\]\n\nThe total number of questions in the second test is 100. Therefore, the number of questions Mark left incomplete is:\n\\[\n100 \\text{ questions} - 70 \\text{ questions} = 30 \\text{ questions}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of questions Mark left incomplete is \\boxed{30}.",
    "answer": "Questions Mark completed in yesterday\u2019s test: 5*8 = <<5*8=40>>40.\nQuestions Mark completed in today\u2019s test: 5*6 = <<5*6=30>>30.\nQuestions Mark left incomplete in yesterday\u2019s test: 75-40 = <<75-40=35>>35\nQuestions Mark left incomplete in today's test: 100-30 = <<100-30=70>>70\nMissed questions in total 35+70 = <<35+70=105>>105.\n#### 105"
