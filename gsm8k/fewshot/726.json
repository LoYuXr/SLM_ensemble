    "question": "Topher, the green giant, wears enormous shoes.  The length of one of his shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby\u2019s shoes.  If the length of one of Topher\u2019s shoes is 8-feet and 4-inches, how long, in inches, is one of Bobby\u2019s shoes?",
    "completion": "To determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we start by converting the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. \n\n1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so:\n\n- 1 foot = 12 inches\n- 8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches\n\nAdding the 4 inches gives us the total length of Topher's shoe in inches:\n\n\\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \\( x \\) inches. According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:\n\n\\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve this equation step by step:\n\n1. Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \\]\n\\[ 90 = 9x \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 9 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{90}{9} \\]\n\\[ x = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.",
    "answer": "Since Topher\u2019s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.\nIf we let the length of one of Bobby\u2019s shoes, in inches, be x.\nThen the length of Topher\u2019s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.\nSubtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90\nSolving for x, the length of one of Bobby\u2019s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10\n#### 10"
