    "question": "A news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day. Its sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily. Calculate the total number of articles the two websites published together in February if there are 28 days in the month.",
    "completion": "To calculate the total number of articles published by the two websites together in February, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of articles published by each website in February.\n2. Sum the articles published by both websites.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of articles published by the news website in February. The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ articles/day} \\times 28 \\text{ days} = 560 \\text{ articles} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of articles published by the sister company in February. The sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day. Similarly, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ articles/day} \\times 28 \\text{ days} = 280 \\text{ articles} \\]\n\nNow, we sum the articles published by both websites to find the total number of articles published in February:\n\\[ 560 \\text{ articles} + 280 \\text{ articles} = 840 \\text{ articles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of articles published by the two websites together in February is:\n\\[ \\boxed{840} \\]",
    "answer": "In February, with 28 days, the political and weather publishing news website produced a total of 28*20=<<28*20=560>>560 articles.\nThe sister company publishing business news had 10*28=<<10*28=280>>280 articles in February.\nIn total, the two companies published 280+560=<<280+560=840>>840 articles.\n#### 840"
