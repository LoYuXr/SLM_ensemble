    "question": "James hires a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.  He gets 1 hour free.  The first paid hour is $15 and each hour after that is twice the cost.  How much did he pay?",
    "completion": "To determine how much James paid for the carriage, we need to break down the cost into two parts: the cost of the first paid hour and the cost of the subsequent hours.\n\n1. **Identify the cost of the first paid hour:**\n   - The first paid hour is $15.\n   - Therefore, the cost of the first paid hour is $15.\n\n2. **Determine the cost of each subsequent hour:**\n   - The cost of each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the previous hour.\n   - The cost of the second paid hour is \\(2 \\times 15 = 30\\) dollars.\n   - The cost of the third paid hour is \\(2 \\times 30 = 60\\) dollars.\n   - The cost of the fourth paid hour is \\(2 \\times 60 = 120\\) dollars.\n   - The cost of the fifth paid hour is \\(2 \\times 120 = 240\\) dollars.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of the first paid hour and the subsequent hours.\n   - Total cost = \\(15 + 30 + 60 + 120 + 240 = 465\\) dollars.\n\nThus, the total amount James paid is \\(\\boxed{465}\\).",
    "answer": "He got it for 9-5=<<9-5=4>>4 hours\nHe pays for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours\nThe first hour cost 1*15=$<<1*15=15>>15\nThe other 3-1=2 hours are more expensive\nThey cost 15*2=$<<15*2=30>>30 per hour\nSo those 2 hours cost 2*30=$<<2*30=60>>60\nSo he pays 60+15=$<<60+15=75>>75 per hours\n#### 75"
