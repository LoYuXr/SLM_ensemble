    "question": "Greg has an alarm set to ring three times a day as a reminder. When the alarm goes off, it continues to ring until Greg turns it off. The first time it went off today, it rang four times. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. How many times did the alarm ring in all?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and then sum these values.\n\n1. The first time the alarm rang:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\n2. The second time the alarm rang:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\n3. The third time the alarm rang:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{2} \\text{ times} = 1.5 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of times the alarm rang each time it went off:\n\\[\n4 + 3 + 1.5 = 8.5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of times the alarm rang is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8.5}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The second time Greg\u2019s alarm went off, it rang three times as long as the first, so it rang 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 times the second time.\nThe third time it went off, it rang half as long as the second, so it rang 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 times the third time.\nIn all, Greg\u2019s alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = <<4+12+6=22>>22 times.\n#### 22"
