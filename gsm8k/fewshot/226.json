    "question": "James is counting his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. If he loses 8 of the water type and buys 14 grass type, what's the percentage chance (rounded to the nearest integer) that a randomly picked card will be a water type?",
    "completion": "To determine the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial number of each type of card:**\n   - Fire type: 30 cards\n   - Grass type: 20 cards\n   - Water type: 40 cards\n\n2. **Account for the changes:**\n   - James loses 8 water type cards.\n   - He buys 14 grass type cards.\n\n3. **Update the number of water type cards:**\n   - Initial water type cards: 40\n   - Water type cards after loss: \\(40 - 8 = 32\\)\n   - Water type cards after purchase: \\(32 + 14 = 46\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of cards:**\n   - Total cards: \\(30 + 20 + 46 = 96\\)\n\n5. **Determine the probability of picking a water type card:**\n   - Probability = \\(\\frac{\\text{Number of water type cards}}{\\text{Total number of cards}} = \\frac{46}{96}\\)\n\n6. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   - Simplify \\(\\frac{46}{96}\\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 46 and 96, which is 2.\n   - \\(\\frac{46 \\div 2}{96 \\div 2} = \\frac{23}{48}\\)\n\n7. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**\n   - \\(\\frac{23}{48} \\approx 0.4708\\)\n   - Convert to percentage: \\(0.4708 \\times 100 \\approx 47\\%\\)\n\nTherefore, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is \\(\\boxed{47}\\).",
    "answer": "First find the final number of grass type Pokemon: 20 grass type + 14 grass type = <<20+14=34>>34 grass type\nThen find the final number of water type Pokemon: 40 water type - 8 water type = <<40-8=32>>32 water type\nThen add the number of each type of Pokemon to find the total number: 34 Pokemon + 32 Pokemon + 30 Pokemon = <<34+32+30=96>>96 Pokemon\nThen divide the number of water type Pokemon by the total number of Pokemon and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 32 water type / 96 Pokemon * 100% = 33.333...%, which rounds down to 33%\n#### 33"
