    "question": "An ice cream factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.  It can make 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.  How many quarts in total would be made in 48 hours?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the rate at which the factory makes ice cream and then use that rate to find out how much ice cream is made in 48 hours.\n\nFirst, let's find the rate at which the factory makes ice cream. The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. Therefore, the rate of making chocolate ice cream is:\n\\[\n\\text{Rate of chocolate ice cream} = \\frac{100 \\text{ quarts}}{2 \\text{ hours}} = 50 \\text{ quarts per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much ice cream is made in 48 hours. Since the factory makes 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream per hour, in 48 hours it will make:\n\\[\n\\text{Quarts of chocolate ice cream in 48 hours} = 50 \\text{ quarts per hour} \\times 48 \\text{ hours} = 2400 \\text{ quarts}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much ice cream is made in 48 hours. Since the factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream per hour, in 48 hours it will make:\n\\[\n\\text{Quarts of vanilla ice cream in 48 hours} = 50 \\text{ quarts per hour} \\times 48 \\text{ hours} = 2400 \\text{ quarts}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the quarts of chocolate ice cream and the quarts of vanilla ice cream to get the total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours:\n\\[\n\\text{Total quarts of ice cream} = 2400 \\text{ quarts (chocolate)} + 2400 \\text{ quarts (vanilla)} = 4800 \\text{ quarts}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4800}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Chocolate ice cream can be made at 100 quarts / 2 hours = <<100/2=50>>50 quarts per hour.\nVanilla ice cream can be made at 50 quarts / 4 hours = <<50/4=12.5>>12.5 quarts per hour.\nIn 48 hours there would be 48 * 50 quarts = <<48*50=2400>>2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.\nIn 48 hours there would be 48 * 12.5 quarts = <<48*12.5=600>>600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.\nCombined there would be 2400 chocolate + 600 vanilla = <<2400+600=3000>>3000 quarts of ice cream.\n#### 3000"
