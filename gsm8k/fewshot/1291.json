    "question": "Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. If George has 18 pens, how many pens does Sarah have?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pens Sarah has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of pens George has.\n2. Use the information about Timothy's pens to find out how many pens Timothy has.\n3. Use the information about Sarah's pens to find out how many pens Sarah has.\n\nFirst, we know that George has 18 pens. According to the problem, Timothy has three times the number of pens that George has. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pens Timothy has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pens Timothy has} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of pens George has} = 3 \\times 18 = 54\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pens Sarah has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pens Sarah has} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Number of pens Timothy has} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 54 = 27\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of pens Sarah has is \\boxed{27}.",
    "answer": "Timothy has 18 * 3 = <<18*3=54>>54 pens.\nThis means that Sarah has 54 /2 = <<54/2=27>>27 pens.\n#### 27"
