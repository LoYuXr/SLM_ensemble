    "question": "Ted the T-Rex was planning to bring potato salad to the dinosaur picnic.  He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult.  If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both the adults and the children.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:\n- Each adult will eat 10 pounds of potato salad.\n- There are 20 adults.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \\text{ adults} \\times 10 \\text{ pounds/adult} = 200 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children:\n- Each child will eat half as much as an adult, so each child will eat \\( \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\) pounds of potato salad.\n- There are 5 children.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \\text{ children} \\times 5 \\text{ pounds/child} = 25 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the amounts for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad needed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total potato salad needed} = \\text{Total potato salad for adults} + \\text{Total potato salad for children} = 200 \\text{ pounds} + 25 \\text{ pounds} = 225 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Ted needs to bring \\boxed{225} pounds of potato salad to the picnic.",
    "answer": "Half of 10 pounds is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 pounds.\nTo feed 20 dinosaur adults, he will need 20*10=<<20*10=200>>200 pounds of potato salad.\nTo feed 5 dinosaur children, he will need 5*5=<<5*5=25>>25 pounds of potato salad.\nIn total, he will need to bring 200+25=<<200+25=225>>225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.\n#### 225"
