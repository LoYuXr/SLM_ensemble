    "question": "From her science class study, Brady learned that each whale in the sea has 40 gallons of blood. She also learned that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Calculate the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have.",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the amount of blood a single shark has:**\n   - Each whale has 40 gallons of blood.\n   - A shark has three times as much blood as a whale.\n   - Therefore, the amount of blood a shark has is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 40 = 120 \\text{ gallons}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of blood for ten sharks:**\n   - Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, the total amount of blood for ten sharks is:\n     \\[\n     120 \\times 10 = 1200 \\text{ gallons}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is \\(\\boxed{1200}\\).",
    "answer": "Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, then a shark has 3*40 = <<3*40=120>>120 gallons of blood.\n10 sharks swimming in the sea will have 10*120 = <<10*120=1200>>1200 gallons of blood.\n#### 1200"
