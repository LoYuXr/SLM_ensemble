    "question": "Three people invested $1200 in a joint savings account.  After Dylan's investment of 2/5 of the total amount, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount.  Skyler's investment accounted for the rest. How much money was Skyler's investment?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Skyler's investment was, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount invested by the three people:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total investment} = \\$1200\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Dylan's investment:**\n   Dylan invested \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the total amount.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Dylan's investment} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 1200 = \\frac{2 \\times 1200}{5} = \\frac{2400}{5} = 480\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the remaining amount after Dylan's investment:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine Frances's investment:**\n   Frances invested \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the remaining amount.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Frances's investment} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 720 = \\frac{2 \\times 720}{3} = \\frac{1440}{3} = 480\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the remaining amount after Frances's investment:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining amount} = 720 - 480 = 240\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine Skyler's investment:**\n   Skyler's investment accounted for the remaining amount.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Skyler's investment} = 240\n   \\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Skyler's investment was \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",
    "answer": "Dylan's investment was 2/5 * $1200 = $<<2/5*1200=480>>480\nFrances and Skylers' investment was $1200 - $480 = $<<1200-480=720>>720\nFrances invested 2/3 * $720 = $<<2/3*720=480>>480\nDylan's and Frances's total investments were $480 + $480 = $<<480+480=960>>960\nSkyler invested $1200 - $960 = $<<1200-960=240>>240\n#### 240"
