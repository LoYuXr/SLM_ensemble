    "question": "To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. How much money would Sam have to spend to make 4 liters of juice?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice.\n2. Determine the cost of the oranges needed for 4 liters of juice.\n\nFirst, we know that 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges. Therefore, for 4 liters of juice, the amount of oranges needed is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ liters} \\times 5 \\text{ kg/liter} = 20 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much $3 per kilogram of oranges costs for 20 kilograms of oranges. The cost is calculated as follows:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ kg} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/kg} = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the amount of money Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice is:\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]",
    "answer": "To make 4 liters of juice, Sam needs 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 kilograms of oranges.\nIf one kilogram of oranges costs $3, then 20 kilograms would cost 20 * 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.\n#### 60"
