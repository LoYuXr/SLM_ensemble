    "question": "Henry and 3 of his friends order 7 pizzas for lunch. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices. If Henry and his friends want to share the pizzas equally, how many slices can each of them have?",
    "completion": "To determine how many slices of pizza each person can have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices.\n2. Divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing them.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and there are 7 pizzas, the total number of slices is:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ pizzas} \\times 8 \\text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing them. There are 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends), so we divide 56 slices by 4 people:\n\\[ 56 \\text{ slices} \\div 4 \\text{ people} = 14 \\text{ slices per person} \\]\n\nTherefore, each person can have \\(\\boxed{14}\\) slices of pizza.",
    "answer": "There are 7*8=<<7*8=56>>56 slices in total.\nThere are 1+3=<<1+3=4>>4 people in total.\nThey can each have 56/4=<<56/4=14>>14 slices.\n#### 14"
