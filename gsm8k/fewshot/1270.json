    "question": "Gary bought a boat for $9000.  Over the first year it depreciated 30%.  The second year it depreciated another 30%.  The third year it depreciated 20%.  How much is the boat worth after the three years?",
    "completion": "To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the depreciation step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Value:**\n   The boat was bought for $9000.\n\n2. **First Year Depreciation:**\n   The boat depreciates by 30% over the first year.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Depreciation for the first year} = 9000 \\times 0.30 = 2700\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value after the first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300\n   \\]\n\n3. **Second Year Depreciation:**\n   The boat depreciates by another 30% over the second year.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Depreciation for the second year} = 6300 \\times 0.30 = 1890\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value after the second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410\n   \\]\n\n4. **Third Year Depreciation:**\n   The boat depreciates by 20% over the third year.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Depreciation for the third year} = 4410 \\times 0.20 = 882\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value after the third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the boat after three years of depreciation is \\(\\boxed{3528}\\).",
    "answer": "After first year:9000(.30)=2700\n9000-2700=<<9000-2700=6300>>6300\nAfter second year:6300(.30)=1890\n6300-1890=<<6300-1890=4410>>4410\nAfter third year:4410(.20)=882\n4410-882=<<4410-882=3528>>3528$\n#### 3528"
