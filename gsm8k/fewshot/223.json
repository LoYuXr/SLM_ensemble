    "question": "A company spends $15000 on advertising for a year, and then spends a third of that amount on advertising for another year.\u00a0 What's the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount the company spent on advertising over the two years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount spent on advertising in the first year.\n2. Calculate the amount spent on advertising in the second year.\n3. Add the two amounts together to get the total.\n\nLet's start with the first year:\nThe company spends $15000 on advertising in the first year.\n\nNext, we calculate the amount spent on advertising in the second year:\nThe company spends a third of the amount spent in the first year on advertising in the second year.\nSo, the amount spent in the second year is:\n\\[\n\\frac{15000}{3} = 5000\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount spent on advertising over the two years:\n\\[\n15000 + 5000 = 20000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is \\boxed{20000}.",
    "answer": "15000/3 = <<15000/3=5000>>5,000 is spent on advertisement in the second year.\nThe total on advertisement for the two years is 15000+5000 = <<15000+5000=20000>>20000 dollars.\n#### 20000"
