    "question": "The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep.  The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.  The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.  How many animals do the farm and zoo have combined?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of cows on the farm:**\n   - The farm has 30 cows.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of sheep on the farm:**\n   - The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm.\n   - Therefore, the number of cows on the zoo is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 30 = 60\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of sheep on the farm:**\n   - The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.\n   - Therefore, the number of sheep on the farm is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of animals on the farm:**\n   - The total number of animals on the farm is the sum of the cows and sheep:\n     \\[\n     30 \\text{ (cows)} + 30 \\text{ (sheep)} = 60\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of animals on the zoo:**\n   - The zoo has 20 sheep.\n   - The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm.\n   - Therefore, the number of cows on the zoo is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 30 = 60\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total number of animals on the zoo:**\n   - The total number of animals on the zoo is the sum of the cows and sheep:\n     \\[\n     60 \\text{ (cows)} + 20 \\text{ (sheep)} = 80\n     \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo:**\n   - The total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo is:\n     \\[\n     60 \\text{ (farm)} + 80 \\text{ (zoo)} = 140\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo is \\boxed{140}.",
    "answer": "The zoo has 2 * 30 cows = <<2*30=60>>60 cows.\nThe farm has 1/2 * 20 sheep = <<1/2*20=10>>10 sheep.\nCombined the zoo and farm have 30 cows + 10 sheep + 60 cows + 20 sheep = <<30+10+60+20=120>>120 animals.\n#### 120"
