    "question": "Jeff owns a catering company.  During a recent event, he sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party.  When they were returned, 10 glasses were broken as well as 6 plates.  How many glasses and plates does Jeff have now?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of glasses sent.\n2. Calculate the total number of plates sent.\n3. Subtract the broken glasses and plates from the total sent.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of glasses sent:\n- Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses.\n- Since 1 dozen equals 12 glasses, 8 dozen glasses is:\n  \\[\n  8 \\times 12 = 96 \\text{ glasses}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of plates sent:\n- Jeff sent 4 dozen plates.\n- Since 1 dozen equals 12 plates, 4 dozen plates is:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 12 = 48 \\text{ plates}\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's subtract the broken glasses and plates from the total sent:\n- The number of broken glasses is 10.\n- The number of broken plates is 6.\n- The total number of broken items is:\n  \\[\n  10 + 6 = 16 \\text{ broken items}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of items Jeff has now:\n- The total number of items is the sum of the total number of glasses and plates minus the total number of broken items:\n  \\[\n  96 + 48 - 16 = 128 \\text{ items}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now is \\boxed{128}.",
    "answer": "He had 8 dozen glasses so he had 8*12 = <<8*12=96>>96 glasses\nHe had 4 dozen plates so he had 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 plates\n10 glasses were broken and he started with 96 so he now has 96-10= 86 glasses\n6 plates were broken and he started with 48 so he now has 48-6 = <<48-6=42>>42\nAll total he has 86 glasses and 42 plates so 86+42 = <<86+42=128>>128 glasses and plates\n#### 128"
