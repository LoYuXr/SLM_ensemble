    "question": "If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, how many hours will it take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to do so?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it will take four turtles traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo to travel the same distance, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the speed of a kangaroo:**\n   - It takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel the same distance.\n   - Therefore, the total distance \\( D \\) can be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     D = 3 \\text{ kangaroos} \\times 18 \\text{ hours} = 54 \\text{ kangaroos} \\times 1 \\text{ hour/kangaroo} = 54 \\text{ kangaroos} \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the speed of a turtle:**\n   - Each turtle is traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo.\n   - Therefore, the speed of a turtle is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Speed of a turtle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Speed of a kangaroo} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\text{ hour/kangaroo} = 0.5 \\text{ hours/kangaroo}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance:**\n   - The total distance \\( D \\) is 54 kangaroos.\n   - The time \\( T \\) it takes for four turtles to travel this distance is:\n     \\[\n     T = \\frac{D}{\\text{Speed of a turtle}} = \\frac{54 \\text{ kangaroos} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours/kangaroo}}{0.5 \\text{ hours/kangaroo}} = \\frac{27 \\text{ kangaroos} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours}}{0.5 \\text{ hours}} = 27 \\text{ kangaroos} \\times 1 \\text{ hour/kangaroo} = 27 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\nThus, it will take four turtles traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo 27 hours to travel the same distance.",
    "answer": "If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed, a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, one kangaroo takes 18/3= <<18/3=6>>6 hours to cross the highway.\nA turtle traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo will take 2*6 = <<2*6=12>>12 hours to cross the highway.\nFour turtles will take a total of 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 hours to travel across the highway.\n#### 48"
