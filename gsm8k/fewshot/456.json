    "question": "In a set of magicians cards, there are 15 red cards, and 60% more green cards. Yellow cards are as many, as the sum of red and green cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of cards in the set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of green cards.\n2. Determine the number of yellow cards.\n3. Sum the number of red, green, and yellow cards to get the total number of cards.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 15 red cards. The problem states that there are 60% more green cards than red cards. To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15:\n\n\\[ 60\\% \\text{ of } 15 = 0.60 \\times 15 = 9 \\]\n\nSo, the number of green cards is:\n\n\\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of yellow cards. The problem states that the number of yellow cards is the sum of the number of red and green cards:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of red, green, and yellow cards to get the total number of cards:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cards in the set is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{78} \\]",
    "answer": "There are 60/100 * 15 = <<60/100*15=9>>9 more green cards than red cards.\nWhich means there are 15 + 9 = <<15+9=24>>24 green cards.\nYellow cards make up to 15 + 24 = <<15+24=39>>39 cards.\nSo in total, there are 39 + 39 = <<39+39=78>>78 cards of different colors.\n#### 78"
