    "question": "When Sophie watches her nephew, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings on it. Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 62. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?",
    "completion": "To determine how many bouncy balls Sophie bought, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the initial number of toys Sophie had:**\n   - Building blocks: 31\n   - Stuffed animals: 8\n   - Stacking rings: 9\n   - Total initial toys: \\(31 + 8 + 9 = 48\\)\n\n2. **Determine the total number of toys Sophie has after buying the tube of bouncy balls:**\n   - Total toys after buying the tube: 62\n\n3. **Calculate the number of toys in the tube:**\n   - Total toys after buying the tube: 62\n   - Initial toys: 48\n   - Number of toys in the tube: \\(62 - 48 = 14\\)\n\nTherefore, the number of bouncy balls Sophie bought is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
    "answer": "Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Sophie has 31 + 8 + 9 + T = 48 + T = 62 toys for her nephew.\nThus, T = 62 - 48 = <<62-48=14>>14 bouncy balls came in the tube.\n#### 14"
