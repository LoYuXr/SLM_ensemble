    "question": "Tanya is teaching at school. She earns $15 for every hour and an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. On Monday she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, and on Wednesday 2 classes for 2 hours. How much did Tanya earn for these two days of teaching?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Tanya earned for teaching on Monday and Wednesday, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday:\n- Tanya earns $15 for every hour of teaching.\n- She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.\n- Therefore, her earnings for Monday are:\n  \\[\n  4 \\text{ classes} \\times 5 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$15 \\text{ per hour} = 4 \\times 5 \\times 15 = 20 \\times 15 = \\$300\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate Tanya's earnings for Wednesday:\n- Tanya earns $5 for each class she teaches.\n- She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.\n- Therefore, her earnings for Wednesday are:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ classes} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$5 \\text{ per class} = 2 \\times 2 \\times 5 = 4 \\times 5 = \\$20\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum up her earnings for both days:\n\\[\n\\$300 + \\$20 = \\$320\n\\]\n\nThus, Tanya earned \\(\\boxed{320}\\) dollars for these two days of teaching.",
    "answer": "Tanya worked for 5 hours + 2 hours = <<5+2=7>>7 hours.\nShe earned therefore 7 hours * $15/hour = $<<7*15=105>>105.\nOn Monday she taught more than 3 classes, so she got a bonus and in total earned $105 + $5 = $110.\n#### 110"
