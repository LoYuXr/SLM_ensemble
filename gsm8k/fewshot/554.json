    "question": "When the water is cold Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long. How much longer does Ray take to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day?",
    "completion": "To determine how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we need to calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on each type of day and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day:\n- The time it takes to swim 1 mile on a cold day is 16 minutes.\n- Therefore, the time to swim 3 miles on a cold day is:\n  \\[\n  16 \\text{ minutes/mile} \\times 3 \\text{ miles} = 48 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day:\n- The time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day is 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes on a cold day.\n- Twice the time on a cold day is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 16 \\text{ minutes} = 32 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n- Adding 2 minutes to this gives:\n  \\[\n  32 \\text{ minutes} + 2 \\text{ minutes} = 34 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the time to swim 3 miles on a hot day is:\n  \\[\n  34 \\text{ minutes/mile} \\times 3 \\text{ miles} = 102 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:\n\\[\n102 \\text{ minutes} - 48 \\text{ minutes} = 54 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, Ray takes \\(\\boxed{54}\\) minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.",
    "answer": "Cold water mile = <<16=16>>16 minutes\nWarm water mile = 2+2(16)=34 minutes\n3 miles in cold water: 3(16)=<<3*16=48>>48 minutes\n3 miles in warm water: 3(34)=<<3*34=102>>102 minutes\nRay takes 102-48=<<102-48=54>>54 minutes longer\n#### 54"
