    "question": "Bennet is a farmer. He sells 20 of his eggplants for $3 each. He has 25 ears of corn that he can sell as well. If Bennet wants to make a total of $135, how much should he sell each ear of corn for?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggplants.\n2. Determine the total revenue from selling the corn.\n3. Find the difference between the total revenue from selling the eggplants and the total revenue from selling the corn.\n4. Divide the difference by the number of ears of corn to find the price per ear of corn.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggplants:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total revenue from eggplants} = 20 \\text{ eggplants} \\times \\$3 \\text{ per eggplant} = \\$60\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the total revenue from selling the corn:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total revenue from corn} = 25 \\text{ ears of corn} \\times \\$3 \\text{ per ear of corn} = \\$75\n   \\]\n\n3. Find the difference between the total revenue from selling the eggplants and the total revenue from selling the corn:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = \\$75 - \\$60 = \\$15\n   \\]\n\n4. Divide the difference by the number of ears of corn to find the price per ear of corn:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price per ear of corn} = \\frac{\\$15}{25 \\text{ ears of corn}} = \\$0.60 \\text{ per ear of corn}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for \\(\\boxed{0.60}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "From his eggplants, Bennet makes 20 * $3 = $<<20*3=60>>60\nBennet needs to make $135 - $60 = $<<135-60=75>>75 from the sale of his corn\nBennet should sell each ear of corn for $75 / 25 = $<<75/25=3>>3\n#### 3"
