    "question": "Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen. She will sell it for $1 for 3 eggs. How much will be Rose's profit?",
    "completion": "To determine Rose's profit, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs Rose bought.\n2. Determine the total cost of the eggs.\n3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.\n4. Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Rose bought.**\n\nRose bought five dozens of eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, we can calculate the total number of eggs as follows:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ dozens} \\times 12 \\text{ eggs/dozen} = 60 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total cost of the eggs.**\n\nRose bought the eggs for $2.40 a dozen. Since she bought 60 eggs, the total cost is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ eggs} \\times 2.40 \\text{ dollars/ dozen} = 144 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.**\n\nRose sells the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the number of sets of 3 eggs she can get from 60 eggs is:\n\\[ \\frac{60 \\text{ eggs}}{3 \\text{ eggs/set}} = 20 \\text{ sets} \\]\nSo, the total revenue is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ sets} \\times 1 \\text{ dollar/set} = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.**\n\nThe profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ dollars} - 144 \\text{ dollars} = -124 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince the profit is negative, it means Rose actually lost $124. Therefore, the correct interpretation of the problem is that Rose lost $124, not made a profit.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-124}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.\nFive dozens of eggs is equal to 12 x 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 eggs.\nSo there are 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 sets of 3 eggs that Rose will sell.\nThus, the total earnings of Rose for selling the eggs are $1 x 20 = $<<20=20>>20.\nTherefore, her profit will be $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8.\n#### 8"
