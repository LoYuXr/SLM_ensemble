    "question": "If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, how many hours would it take for 5 people to paint a whole house?",
    "completion": "To determine how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of work in terms of \"painting days\":**\n   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.\n   - Therefore, one person can paint \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a house in 5 days.\n   - So, one person can paint \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a house in 5 days.\n\n2. **Determine the total amount of work in terms of \"painting days\":**\n   - If one person can paint \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a house in 5 days, then 5 people can paint \\( 5 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{2} \\) of a house in 5 days.\n\n3. **Convert the total work from \"painting days\" to \"hours\":**\n   - There are 24 hours in a day.\n   - Therefore, \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\) of a house is \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\times 24 \\) hours.\n   - Calculate \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\times 24 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5}{2} \\times 24 = \\frac{5 \\times 24}{2} = \\frac{120}{2} = 60 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\nSo, it would take 5 people \\(\\boxed{60}\\) hours to paint a whole house.",
    "answer": "First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.\nSince five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.\n#### 48"
