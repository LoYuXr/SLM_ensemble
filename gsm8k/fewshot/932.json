    "question": "Maria invited 4 of her friends over for a water balloon fight in the backyard. At the start of the game, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons. She had one water balloon for herself.  Then her mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons.  How many total balloons did the girls have?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of water balloons the girls have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of water balloons each friend received initially.\n2. Add the number of water balloons each friend received from Maria's mom.\n3. Sum the initial balloons and the additional balloons from Maria's mom to get the total number of balloons.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Each friend initially received 2 water balloons.\n2. Maria's mom gave each friend 3 more balloons.\n3. Maria received 1 water balloon.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of water balloons each friend received initially:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ (initial balloons)} + 3 \\text{ (additional balloons from mom)} = 5 \\text{ (total balloons per friend)} \\]\n\nNext, we add the additional balloons from Maria's mom to the total:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ (initial balloons)} + 3 \\text{ (additional balloons from mom)} = 8 \\text{ (total balloons)} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of water balloons the girls have is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Maria's 4 friends started with 2 balloons * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 balloons.\nMaria started with 1 balloon + 8 balloons = <<1+8=9>>9 balloons to begin with.\nMaria's mom came out and gave each girl 3 more balloons, which is 5 girls * 3 balloons = <<5*3=15>>15 balloons.\nTotal balloons used by the girls is 9 + 15 = <<9+15=24>>24 balloons.\n#### 24"
