    "question": "If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000/year. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. If she quits after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?",
    "completion": "To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break down the pension structure and calculate it step by step.\n\n1. **Annual Pension for the First 20 Years:**\n   Marcy gets an annual pension of $50,000/year for the first 20 years.\n\n2. **Annual Pension for the Next 10 Years:**\n   After 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of her pension per year. The value of her pension after 20 years is $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.\n   Therefore, the pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $1,000,000 = $50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000.\n\n3. **Total Annual Pension:**\n   Adding the two parts together, Marcy's total annual pension after 30 years is $50,000/year (first 20 years) + $500,000/year (next 10 years) = $550,000/year.\n\nSo, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be \\boxed{550000}.",
    "answer": "First find how many years Marcy works after 20 years: 30 years - 20 years = <<30-20=10>>10 years\nThen multiply that number by the amount of her pension she gets per year: 10 years * 5% = 50%\nThen multiply that percentage by the total amount of the full pension to find how much she gets: $50,000 * 50% = $<<50000*50*.01=25000>>25,000\n#### 25000"
