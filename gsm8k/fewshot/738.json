    "question": "Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Clara has two times as many books as Steven. If Clara has 20 books, how many more books does Clara have than Alice?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more books Clara has than Alice, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of books Steven has:**\n   - We know that Clara has 20 books and that Clara has two times as many books as Steven.\n   - Let \\( S \\) represent the number of books Steven has.\n   - According to the problem, \\( 20 = 2S \\).\n   - Solving for \\( S \\):\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n     \\]\n   - So, Steven has 10 books.\n\n2. **Determine the number of books Alice has:**\n   - Alice has 6 more books than Steven.\n   - Let \\( A \\) represent the number of books Alice has.\n   - According to the problem, \\( A = S + 6 \\).\n   - Substituting \\( S = 10 \\):\n     \\[\n     A = 10 + 6 = 16\n     \\]\n   - So, Alice has 16 books.\n\n3. **Calculate how many more books Clara has than Alice:**\n   - Clara has 20 books.\n   - Alice has 16 books.\n   - The difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has is:\n     \\[\n     20 - 16 = 4\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Clara has \\(\\boxed{4}\\) more books than Alice.",
    "answer": "Steven has 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 books\nAlice has 10+6 = <<10+6=16>>16 books\nClara has 20-16 = <<20-16=4>>4 more books than Alice\n#### 4"
