    "question": "Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside.  Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles.  While on vacation, if she will be outside 4 hours a day over 8 days, how many bottles of sunscreen will she need to pack?",
    "completion": "To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need to pack, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use over the 8 days.\n2. Determine how many 8-ounce bottles are required to provide that amount of sunscreen.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use over the 8 days. Since she will be outside for 4 hours each day and she will be outside for 8 days, the total time spent outside is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 8 \\text{ days} = 32 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the total time spent outside into ounces. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 8 ounces in a bottle, we can calculate the total amount of sunscreen in ounces as follows:\n\\[ 32 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} \\times 8 \\text{ ounces/minute} = 15360 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many 8-ounce bottles are required to provide 15360 ounces of sunscreen. We do this by dividing the total amount of sunscreen by the capacity of one bottle:\n\\[ \\frac{15360 \\text{ ounces}}{8 \\text{ ounces/bottle}} = 1920 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nTherefore, Pamela will need to pack \\(\\boxed{1920}\\) bottles of sunscreen.",
    "answer": "She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days so that's 4*8 = <<4*8=32>>32 hours\nShe applies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour and she'll be outside for 32 hours so she needs 1*32 = <<1*32=32>>32 ounces of sunscreen\nHer bottle holds 8 ounces of sunscreen and she needs 32 ounces so she will need to pack 32/8 = 4 bottles of sunscreen\n#### 4"
