    "question": "Last Friday, 13 of the 82 teachers at Rydell Elementary School were sick. There were 9 substitute teachers called in to help. How many teachers were at school that day?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School that day, we need to consider both the teachers who were present and the substitute teachers who were called in to help. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the number of teachers who were present: 13.\n2. Identify the number of substitute teachers: 9.\n3. Add the number of present teachers and the number of substitute teachers to get the total number of teachers at school that day.\n\nSo, the total number of teachers at school that day is:\n\\[ 13 + 9 = 22 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of teachers at school that day is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",
    "answer": "There were 82 \u2013 13 = <<82-13=69>>69 regular teachers at school.\nIf we add the substitute teachers, we find there were 69 + 9 = <<69+9=78>>78 teachers at school that day.\n#### 78"
