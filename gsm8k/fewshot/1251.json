    "question": "It takes John 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube.  The second and third sides each take twice that long.  The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first, and once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides.  How long does the Rubik's cube take?",
    "completion": "To determine the total time it takes for John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the time for each side.\n\n1. **First Side:**\n   - Time to solve the first side: 5 minutes\n\n2. **Second Side:**\n   - Time to solve the second side: \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) minutes\n\n3. **Third Side:**\n   - Time to solve the third side: \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) minutes\n\n4. **Fourth Side:**\n   - Time to solve the fourth side: \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) minutes\n\n5. **Fifth Side:**\n   - Time to solve the fifth side: \\(2 \\times 40 = 80\\) minutes\n\n6. **Sixth Side:**\n   - Time to solve the sixth side: \\(5 \\times 80 = 400\\) minutes\n\nNow, we sum up the times for all six sides:\n\n\\[\n5 \\text{ minutes} + 10 \\text{ minutes} + 20 \\text{ minutes} + 40 \\text{ minutes} + 80 \\text{ minutes} + 400 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 5 + 10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 400\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 575 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes for John to solve the Rubik's cube is \\(\\boxed{575}\\) minutes.",
    "answer": "The second and third side each take 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes\nSo they take 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 minutes together\nThe last 2 sides take 5/2=<<5/2=2.5>>2.5 minutes\nSo they take 2.5*2=<<2.5*2=5>>5 minutes\nSo the total time is 5+20+5=<<5+20+5=30>>30 minutes\n#### 30"
