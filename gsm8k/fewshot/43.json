    "question": "According to its nutritional info, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories?",
    "completion": "To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of calories in a 300g bag of chips.\n2. Determine how many calories you have already consumed.\n3. Calculate how many calories you can consume based on your daily calorie target.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories in a 300g bag of chips.**\n\nThe nutritional info states that a 300g bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, the total number of calories in the 300g bag is:\n\\[ 250 \\text{ calories/serving} \\times 300 \\text{ grams} = 75000 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many calories you have already consumed.**\n\nYou have already consumed 1800 calories.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many calories you can consume based on your daily calorie target.**\n\nYour daily calorie target is 2000 calories. Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, the number of calories you can consume is:\n\\[ 2000 \\text{ calories} - 1800 \\text{ calories} = 200 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nSince each serving of chips contains 250 calories, the number of servings you can eat is:\n\\[ \\frac{200 \\text{ calories}}{250 \\text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \\text{ servings} \\]\n\nSince you can only eat whole servings, you can eat 0.8 servings, which is equivalent to 0.8 * 250 calories = 200 calories.\n\nTherefore, the number of grams you can eat is:\n\\[ 0.8 \\text{ servings} \\times 250 \\text{ calories/serving} = 200 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{200}\n\\]",
    "answer": "If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat\nIf each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving\nWe also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams\nIf I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams\n#### 48"
