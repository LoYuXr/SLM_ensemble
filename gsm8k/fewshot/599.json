    "question": "A pet store currently has 5 dogs, 2 cats, and 10 birds. How many legs in total do the pets in the store have?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Dogs:**\n   - Each dog has 4 legs.\n   - There are 5 dogs.\n   - Total legs from dogs: \\( 5 \\text{ dogs} \\times 4 \\text{ legs/dog} = 20 \\text{ legs} \\).\n\n2. **Cats:**\n   - Each cat has 4 legs.\n   - There are 2 cats.\n   - Total legs from cats: \\( 2 \\text{ cats} \\times 4 \\text{ legs/cat} = 8 \\text{ legs} \\).\n\n3. **Birds:**\n   - Each bird has 2 legs.\n   - There are 10 birds.\n   - Total legs from birds: \\( 10 \\text{ birds} \\times 2 \\text{ legs/bird} = 20 \\text{ legs} \\).\n\nNow, we sum the legs from all the pets:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \\text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \\text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \\text{ legs} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs in the pet store is \\(\\boxed{48}\\).",
    "answer": "The dogs have 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = <<5*4=20>>20 legs.\nThe cats have 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = <<2*4=8>>8 legs.\nThe birds have 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = <<10*2=20>>20 legs.\nThe pets have 20 legs + 8 legs + 20 legs = <<20+8+20=48>>48 legs.\n#### 48"
