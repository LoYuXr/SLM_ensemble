    "question": "To raise money for their class fund, each of the 30 students from one class sold lollipops that cost $0.8 per lollypop. On average, each student sold 10 lollipops. If they bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, how much money was the class able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.\n2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.\n3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the revenue.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.**\n\nEach student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students in the class. Therefore, the total number of lollipops sold is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ students} \\times 10 \\text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \\text{ lollipops} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**\n\nEach lollypop costs $0.8, so the total revenue from selling 300 lollipops is:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ lollipops} \\times 0.8 \\text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the profit by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the revenue.**\n\nThe cost of each lollypop is $0.5, so the total cost of the lollipops is:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ lollipops} \\times 0.5 \\text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:\n\\[ 240 \\text{ dollars} - 150 \\text{ dollars} = 90 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the class was able to raise \\(\\boxed{90}\\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops.",
    "answer": "The class got $0.8 - $0.5 = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3 profit from each lollipop.\nSo each student raised $0.3 x 10 = $<<0.3*10=3>>3 from selling 10 lollipops.\nTherefore, they were able to raise a total of $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90.\n#### 90"
