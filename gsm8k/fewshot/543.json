    "question": "For each small task accomplished, Jairus gets $0.8 while Jenny gets $0.5. If each of them finished 20 tasks, how much more will Jairus get than Jenny?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more Jairus will get than Jenny after completing 20 tasks each, we need to calculate the total amount of money each of them will receive and then find the difference between these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Jairus will receive:\n- Jairus gets $0.8 for each task.\n- Jairus will complete 20 tasks.\n- Therefore, Jairus's total amount of money is:\n  \\[\n  0.8 \\times 20 = 16\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of money Jenny will receive:\n- Jenny gets $0.5 for each task.\n- Jenny will also complete 20 tasks.\n- Therefore, Jenny's total amount of money is:\n  \\[\n  0.5 \\times 20 = 10\n  \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's total amounts of money:\n\\[\n16 - 10 = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, Jairus will get \\(\\boxed{6}\\) dollars more than Jenny.",
    "answer": "The difference of the amount received by Jairus and Jenny is $0.8/task - $0.5/task = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3/task.\nSo, Jairus will get $0.3/task x 20 tasks = $<<0.3*20=6>>6 more than Jenny.\n#### 6"
