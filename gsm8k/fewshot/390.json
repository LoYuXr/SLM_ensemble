    "question": "Monica is wrapping Christmas gifts. She has 6 gifts to wrap for her family, 4 gifts to wrap for her friends and 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers. She has 144 inches of ribbon and wants to make a bow for each gift with it. How many inches of ribbon can she use for each gift bow?",
    "completion": "To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of gift bows Monica needs to make.\n2. Divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gift bows.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of gift bows. Monica has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. So, the total number of gift bows is:\n\\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many inches of ribbon are required for each gift bow. Monica has 144 inches of ribbon in total. Since she needs to make 12 gift bows, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gift bows:\n\\[ \\frac{144}{12} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, Monica can use \\(\\boxed{12}\\) inches of ribbon for each gift bow.",
    "answer": "Monica is has 6 gifts for family + 4 gifts for friends + 2 gifts for teachers = <<6+4+2=12>>12 gifts to wrap.\nHer ribbon can be divided equally 144 inches of ribbon / 12 gifts = <<144/12=12>>12 inches of ribbon per gift.\n#### 12"
