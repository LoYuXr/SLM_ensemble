    "question": "Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, and Harriet is half the age of Zack. Calculate the average age of the three in three years if Harriet is 21 years old now.",
    "completion": "To determine the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Adrian's current age:**\n   - We know that Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.\n   - Harriet is currently 21 years old.\n   - Therefore, Adrian's current age is \\( 3 \\times 21 = 63 \\) years old.\n\n2. **Determine Harriet's current age:**\n   - We know that Harriet is half the age of Zack.\n   - Zack is currently unknown, but we can express Harriet's age in terms of Zack's age.\n   - Let \\( Z \\) be Zack's current age.\n   - Then, Harriet's current age is \\( \\frac{Z}{2} \\).\n   - Since we don't have the exact age of Zack, we can express Harriet's age in terms of Zack's age. However, we can use the fact that Harriet is half the age of Zack to find a relationship between Zack and Harriet's ages.\n   - If we assume Zack's age is \\( Z \\), then Harriet's age is \\( \\frac{Z}{2} \\).\n   - Since we don't have the exact age of Zack, we can use the fact that Harriet is half the age of Zack to find a relationship between Zack and Harriet's ages.

    "answer": "In three years, Harriet will be 21+3 = <<21+3=24>>24 years old.\nSince Adrian's age is three times that of Harriet, Adrian is 3*21 = <<3*21=63>>63 years old.\nIn three years, he will be 63+3 =<<63+3=66>>66 years old.\nIf Harriet is half times the age of Zack, Zack is 21*2 = <<21*2=42>>42 years old.\nIn three years, he will be 42+3 = <<42+3=45>>45 years old.\nThe combined age of the three in 3 years will be 45+66+24 = <<45+66+24=135>>135 years.\nThe average age for the in three years will be 135/3 =<<135/3=45>>45 years\n#### 45"
