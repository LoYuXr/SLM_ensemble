    "question": "Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?",
    "completion": "To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to calculate the time she spends running and walking, and then use that to find the distance she covers.\n\nFirst, let's find out how long Dana spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we can calculate the time spent running as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time spent running} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time spent walking} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine her running speed. We know that she can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. Let's denote her walking speed as \\( v \\) miles per hour. Then her running speed is \\( 4v \\) miles per hour. The distance she covers while running is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n\\]\n\nFor the running part, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance running} = 4v \\times 2 = 8v \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nFor the walking part, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance walking} = v \\times 4 = 4v \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThe total distance she covers in six hours is the sum of the distance she runs and the distance she walks:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = 8v + 4v = 12v \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nWe know that the total distance she covers is 6 miles, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n12v = 6\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( v \\):\n\n\\[\nv = \\frac{6}{12} = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\nNow that we know her walking speed \\( v \\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile per hour, we can find her running speed:\n\n\\[\n4v = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 2 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total distance she covers in six hours:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = 8",
    "answer": "If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.\nIf two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.\nIf one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.\nThus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.\nShe walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.\n#### 18"
