    "question": "Ram uses a lot of pens. He discovered that he can save money by mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. If he buys 25 pens and then uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low, how many total pens does he get to have?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of pens Ram can have after mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen and then using them to make new pens when the ink runs low, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: Ram starts with 25 pens.\n2. **Mixing the Ink**: He can mix the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. This means he can make 5 pens from the 25 pens he starts with.\n3. **Using the Pens**: After making 5 pens, he will use them to make new pens. Since he can make 5 pens from the 25 pens he starts with, he will use 5 pens to make 5 new pens.\n4. **Total Pens**: The total number of pens Ram will have is the sum of the pens he made from the initial 25 pens and the pens he used to make the new pens. Therefore, the total number of pens is:\n   \\[\n   25 + 5 = 30\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
    "answer": "He can make 5 pens when the 25 run low because 25 / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5\nHe can make 1 pen when the ink in the re-made pens runs low because 5 / 1 = <<5/1=5>>5\nHe will have 31 total pens because 25 + 5 + 1 = <<25+5+1=31>>31\n#### 31"
