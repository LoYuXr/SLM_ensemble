    "question": "Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher\u2019s lounge is 40. How many coffee mugs are in the teacher\u2019s lounge?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as an equation:\n\n\\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we need to solve this equation step by step.\n\nFirst, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4x = 32 \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{4x}{4} = \\frac{32}{4} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ x = 8 \\]\n\nSo, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \\( 8 \\).",
    "answer": "Let m be the number of mugs\n8+4*m=40\n4*m=40-8=32\n4m=<<32=32>>32\nm=<<8=8>>8\n#### 8"
