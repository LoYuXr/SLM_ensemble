    "question": "Carly wants to treat her friends. She orders five hamburgers at $4 each, ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each pack, and five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each can.  How much change does Carly get back if she gives one fifty-dollar bill?",
    "completion": "To determine how much change Carly gets back, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she ordered and then subtract that from the amount of money she gave her.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the hamburgers:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ hamburgers} \\times \\$4 \\text{ per hamburger} = \\$20 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the potato fries:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ packs} \\times \\$0.30 \\text{ per pack} = \\$3 \\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the cost of the fruit drinks:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ cans} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per can} = \\$10 \\]\n\nNow, we add up the costs of all the items:\n\\[ \\$20 + \\$3 + \\$10 = \\$33 \\]\n\nCarly gave her a fifty-dollar bill, so we subtract the total cost from the amount of money she gave:\n\\[ \\$50 - \\$33 = \\$17 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of change Carly gets back is:\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]",
    "answer": "The cost of 5 hamburgers is 5 x $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.\nThe cost of 10 packs of potato fries is 10 x $0.30 = $<<10*0.3=3>>3.\nAnd, the cost of 5 cans of fruit drinks is 5 x $2 = $<<5*2=10>>10.\nThus, the total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $<<20+3+10=33>>33.\nTherefore, Carly gets a change of $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.\n#### 17"
