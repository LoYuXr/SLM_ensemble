    "question": "Two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head.  Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.  Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree.  This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.  Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.  How many apples did he bring home?",
    "completion": "Let's analyze the problem step by step to determine how many apples Newton brought home.\n\n1. **Initial Condition:**\n   - Two apples fell out of the tree.\n   - One apple landed on Newton's head.\n   - Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree.\n\n2. **First Transfer:**\n   - Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree.\n   - This causes 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.\n   - The total number of apples after the first transfer is \\(2 + 1 + 5 = 8\\).\n\n3. **Second Transfer:**\n   - Newton picked up the remaining 7 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.\n   - This causes another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.\n   - The total number of apples after the second transfer is \\(7 + 1 + 6 = 14\\).\n\n4. **Final Condition:**\n   - Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.\n   - The total number of apples he brought home is 14.\n\nThus, the number of apples Newton brought home is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
    "answer": "Two apples fell out of the tree, and Newton threw one away, leaving him with 2-1=<<2-1=1>>1 apples.\n5 more apples fell out of the tree, bringing his total to 5+1=<<5+1=6>>6 apples.\nNewton threw one at the tree, leaving him with 6-1=<<6-1=5>>5 apples.\n6 more apples fell out of the tree, bringing Newton's apple collection to a total of 5+6=<<5+6=11>>11 apples.\n#### 11"
