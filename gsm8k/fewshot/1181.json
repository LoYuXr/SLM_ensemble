    "question": "Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. How old is Colin now?",
    "completion": "Let's denote Wendy's current age as \\( W \\) and Colin's current age as \\( C \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ W = 7 + 5C \\]\n\nAdditionally, in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ C + 25 = \\frac{1}{3}W \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1. \\( W = 7 + 5C \\)\n2. \\( C + 25 = \\frac{1}{3}W \\)\n\nWe can substitute the expression for \\( W \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[ C + 25 = \\frac{1}{3}(7 + 5C) \\]\n\nNext, we clear the fraction by multiplying every term by 3:\n\\[ 3(C + 25) = 7 + 5C \\]\n\\[ 3C + 75 = 7 + 5C \\]\n\nNow, we isolate \\( C \\) by subtracting \\( 3C \\) from both sides:\n\\[ 75 = 7 + 2C \\]\n\nThen, we subtract 7 from both sides:\n\\[ 68 = 2C \\]\n\nFinally, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[ C = 34 \\]\n\nSo, Colin is currently \\(\\boxed{34}\\) years old.",
    "answer": "Let x be Colin's age now.\n(x+7)*5=(x+25)*3\n5*x+35=3*x+75\n2*x=40\nx=<<20=20>>20\n#### 20"
