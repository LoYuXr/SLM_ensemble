    "question": "A large bag of Starbursts candy has 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies.  If this bag has 54 red candies, twice that amount of orange candies and half as many yellow candies as red candies, how many candies are pink?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of red candies.\n2. Calculate the number of orange candies.\n3. Calculate the number of yellow candies.\n4. Subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies to find the number of pink candies.\n\nLet's start with the given information:\n- The total number of candies in the bag is 232.\n- The number of red candies is 54.\n- The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies.\n- The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of orange candies:\n\\[ \\text{Number of orange candies} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of red candies} = 2 \\times 54 = 108 \\]\n\nNext, calculate the number of yellow candies:\n\\[ \\text{Number of yellow candies} = \\frac{\\text{Number of red candies}}{2} = \\frac{54}{2} = 27 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:\n\\[ \\text{Number of pink candies} = \\text{Total number of candies} - \\text{Number of red candies} - \\text{Number of orange candies} - \\text{Number of yellow candies} = 232 - 54 - 108 - 27 \\]\n\nPerform the subtraction step-by-step:\n\\[ 232 - 54 = 178 \\]\n\\[ 178 - 108 = 70 \\]\n\\[ 70 - 27 = 43 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pink candies is:\n\\[ \\boxed{43} \\]",
    "answer": "There are 54 red candies and twice that amount of orange candies for a total of 54*2 = <<54*2=108>>108 candies\nThe yellow candies are half the amount of the 54 red candies so there are 54/2 = <<54/2=27>>27 candies\nAll total there are 54 red candies, 108 orange candies and 27 yellow candies so 54+108+27 = <<54+108+27=189>>189 candies\nThe bag has 232 candies and the red, orange and yellow candies total 189 pieces so there are 232-189 = <<232-189=43>>43 pink candies\n#### 43"
