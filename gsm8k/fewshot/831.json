    "question": "An interior design firm offers installation for $129.00.  It includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.  They will install additional items for an extra $15.00 per item.  Angela has 6 mirrors and 2 chandeliers and 20 pictures that she needs installed/hung.  How much will this cost her?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost for Angela's installation, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and then add the additional items she needs to install.\n\n1. **Initial Installation Cost:**\n   - The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.\n   - Cost of initial installation = $129.00\n\n2. **Additional Items Cost:**\n   - Additional items cost $15.00 per item.\n   - Angela needs to install 6 mirrors and 2 chandeliers.\n   - Cost of additional items = 6 mirrors * $15.00 + 2 chandeliers * $15.00\n   - Cost of additional items = $90.00 + $30.00 = $120.00\n\n3. **Total Cost:**\n   - Total cost = Initial installation cost + Cost of additional items\n   - Total cost = $129.00 + $120.00 = $249.00\n\nTherefore, the total cost for Angela's installation will be $249.00.",
    "answer": "The service includes 4 mirrors and she has 6 so that's 6-4 = <<6-4=2>>2 extra mirrors\nAn additional item is an extra $15.00 so that's 2*15 = $30.00\nThe service includes 1 chandelier and she has 2 so that's 2-1 = 1 extra chandelier\nAn additional item is an extra $15.00 so that's 1*15 = $<<1*15=15.00>>15.00\nThe service includes 10 pictures and she has 20 to that's 20-10 = <<20-10=10>>10 extra pictures\nAn additional item is an extra $15.00 so that's 10*15 = $<<10*15=150.00>>150.00\nThe service costs $129.00 and the extra mirrors are $30.00, the chandelier is $15.00 and the pictures are $150.00 for a total of 129+30+15+150 = $<<129+30+15+150=324.00>>324.00\n#### 324"
