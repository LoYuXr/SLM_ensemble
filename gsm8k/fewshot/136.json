    "question": "There are 27 unicorns left in the world.  One third of them are in the Scottish Highlands.  Two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female.  How many female Scottish unicorns are there?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.\n2. Determine the number of female unicorns among the Scottish unicorns.\n\nFirst, we know that one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. So, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands} = \\frac{27}{3} = 9\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. So, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 9 = 6\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is \\boxed{6}.",
    "answer": "Scottish Unicorns:27(1/3)=9\nFemale:9(2/3)=6 unicorns\n#### 6"
