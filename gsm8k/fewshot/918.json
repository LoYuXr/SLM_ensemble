    "question": "There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. If each student only participates in one group, how many students are there in total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of students, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of students playing tennis.\n2. Determine the number of students playing volleyball.\n3. Calculate the total number of students playing tennis and volleyball.\n4. Add the number of boys and girls playing soccer to the total number of students playing tennis and volleyball.\n\nLet's start with the number of students playing tennis. According to the problem, there are 6 students playing tennis.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many students are playing volleyball. The problem states that there are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis. Therefore, the number of students playing volleyball is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of students playing tennis and volleyball:\n\\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many students are playing soccer. The problem states that there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. Therefore, the total number of students playing soccer is:\n\\[ 16 + 22 = 38 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to the number of students playing soccer to get the total number of students:\n\\[ 18 + 38 = 56 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of students is:\n\\[ \\boxed{56} \\]",
    "answer": "There are 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 students playing volleyball.\nThere are 16 + 22 = <<16+22=38>>38 students playing soccer.\nIn total there are 6 + 12 + 38 = <<6+12+38=56>>56 students.\n#### 56"
