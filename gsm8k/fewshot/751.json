    "question": "Gunther, the gorilla, had 48 bananas hidden under a fern branch.  When Gunther wasn't looking, Arnold, the chimpanzee, stole half of the bananas from the pile.  The next day, Gunther added another 25 bananas to his pile, but later that evening, Arnold stole another 12 of the bananas.  On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas to his pile and began counting bananas.  How many bananas did Gunther find were in the pile?",
    "completion": "To determine how many bananas Gunther found in the pile, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of bananas step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of bananas:**\n   Gunther had 48 bananas.\n\n2. **Arnold steals half of the bananas:**\n   Arnold stole half of the 48 bananas.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bananas stolen by Arnold} = \\frac{48}{2} = 24\n   \\]\n   So, Arnold now has:\n   \\[\n   48 - 24 = 24 \\text{ bananas}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Gunther adds another 25 bananas:**\n   Gunther then adds 25 more bananas to his pile.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bananas Gunther has} = 24 + 25 = 49\n   \\]\n\n4. **Arnold steals another 12 bananas:**\n   Arnold then steals 12 more bananas from the pile.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bananas Arnold has} = 49 - 12 = 37\n   \\]\n\n5. **Gunther adds another 6 bananas:**\n   On the third day, Gunther adds 6 more bananas to his pile.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bananas Gunther has} = 37 + 6 = 43\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is \\(\\boxed{43}\\).",
    "answer": "Half of 48 bananas is 48/2=<<48/2=24>>24 bananas.\nArnold's first act of thievery removes 24 bananas, leaving 48-24=24 bananas.\nStarting with the remaining 24 bananas, adding 25 bananas to the pile brings the total to 24+25=<<24+25=49>>49 bananas.\nArnold's second act of thievery resulted in 49-12=<<49-12=37>>37 bananas remaining.\nGunther adds another 6 bananas, resulting in the final number of 37+6=<<37+6=43>>43 bananas.\n#### 43"
