    "question": "Aiden and 12 of his friends are going to see a film at the cinema, and meet up with 7 more friends there. They each save a seat and then buy enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Each seat has enough room to hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. If drinks and snacks cost $2 each, how much money, in dollars, has the group spent overall on snacks and drinks?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of friends:**\n   - Aiden and 12 friends in total.\n   - 7 more friends.\n   - Total number of friends = 12 + 7 = 19.\n\n2. **Determine the number of seats each friend will occupy:**\n   - Each seat holds one person.\n   - Therefore, each friend will occupy 1 seat.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of seats:**\n   - Total number of seats = Number of friends \u00d7 Number of seats per friend.\n   - Total number of seats = 19 \u00d7 1 = 19 seats.\n\n4. **Determine the cost of drinks and snacks per seat:**\n   - Drinks cost $2 each.\n   - Snacks cost $2 each.\n   - Total cost per seat = Cost of drinks + Cost of snacks.\n   - Total cost per seat = $2 + $2 = $4.\n\n5. **Calculate the total cost for all the seats:**\n   - Total cost for all seats = Total number of seats \u00d7 Total cost per seat.\n   - Total cost for all seats = 19 \u00d7 $4 = $76.\n\nThus, the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is \\(\\boxed{76}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Including Aiden, the whole group saves 1 + 12 + 7 = <<1+12+7=20>>20 seats.\nIn total, the seats can hold 2 drinks * 20 seats = <<2*20=40>>40 drinks.\nIn total, the seats can hold 3 snacks * 20 seats = <<3*20=60>>60 snacks.\nSo in total, the group buys 40 drinks + 60 snacks = <<40+60=100>>100 items.\nAs snacks and drinks cost $2 each, the group has spent 100 items * $2 = $<<100*2=200>>200 overall.\n#### 200"
