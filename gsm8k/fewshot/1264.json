    "question": "Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next thirty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of popcorn kernels that have popped, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Pop Rate:**\n   - In the first 30 seconds, the kernels start popping at a rate of 20 kernels per second.\n   - Therefore, in 30 seconds, the number of kernels that pop is:\n     \\[\n     20 \\text{ kernels/second} \\times 30 \\text{ seconds} = 600 \\text{ kernels}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Rate Increase in the Next 30 Seconds:**\n   - In the next 30 seconds, the rate of popping increases to three times the initial rate.\n   - Therefore, in 30 seconds, the number of kernels that pop is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 20 \\text{ kernels/second} \\times 30 \\text{ seconds} = 1800 \\text{ kernels}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Rate Decrease in the Final 30 Seconds:**\n   - In the final 30 seconds, the rate of popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds.\n   - Therefore, in 30 seconds, the number of kernels that pop is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1800 \\text{ kernels} = 900 \\text{ kernels}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Residual Heat:**\n   - After the final 30 seconds, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat.\n   - Therefore, the number of kernels that pop from the residual heat is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{4} \\times 900 \\text{ kernels} = 225 \\text{ kernels}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Total Number of Popcorn Kernels:**\n   - Adding up all the kernels that popped:\n     \\[\n     600 \\text{ kernels} + 1800 \\text{ kernels} + 900 \\text{ kernels} + 225 \\text{ kernels} = 3425 \\text{ kernels}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of popcorn kernels that Garrett has to eat is \\(\\boxed{3425}\\).",
    "answer": "In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 kernels pop.\nIn the third 30 seconds, 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 kernels pop.\nIn the final 30 seconds, 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 kernels pop.\nAfter cooking, the residual heat makes 40 / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 kernels pop.\nThus, Garrett has 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = <<20+60+80+40+10=210>>210 pieces of popcorn to eat.\n#### 210"
