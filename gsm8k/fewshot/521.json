    "question": "Chris is way behind on his math homework. He has 100 math problems to complete in total. He completes 12 problems on Monday night. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. How many math problems does he have left to complete on Thursday?",
    "completion": "To determine how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of problems Chris completes on Tuesday.\n2. Determine the number of problems remaining after Monday.\n3. Calculate the number of problems Chris completes on Wednesday.\n4. Determine the number of problems remaining after Wednesday.\n5. Calculate the number of problems Chris completes on Thursday.\n6. Determine the number of problems remaining after Thursday.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Chris completes 12 problems on Monday night.\n2. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 12 = 36\n   \\]\n   So, Chris completes 36 problems on Tuesday.\n3. The total number of problems completed by Monday and Tuesday is:\n   \\[\n   12 + 36 = 48\n   \\]\n4. The number of problems remaining after Monday and Tuesday is:\n   \\[\n   100 - 48 = 52\n   \\]\n5. On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 52 = 13\n   \\]\n   So, Chris completes 13 problems on Wednesday.\n6. The number of problems remaining after Wednesday is:\n   \\[\n   52 - 13 = 39\n   \\]\n7. On Thursday, Chris completes the remaining problems:\n   \\[\n   39\n   \\]\n   So, Chris completes 39 problems on Thursday.\n8. The number of problems remaining after Thursday is:\n   \\[\n   39 - 39 = 0\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",
    "answer": "On Tuesday he completes 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 math problems.\nThis leaves him with 100 - 12 - 36 = <<100-12-36=52>>52 math problems to complete.\nOn Wednesday he completes 52 * 0.25 = <<52*0.25=13>>13 math problems.\nThis leaves him with 52 - 13 = <<52-13=39>>39 math problems to complete on Thursday.\n#### 39"
