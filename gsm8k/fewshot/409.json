In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months.",
    "completion": "To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of employees hired in May.\n2. Calculate the total number of employees hired in June.\n3. Determine the total number of employees hired in both months.\n4. Calculate the total amount of money paid to all employees in May and June.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the number of employees hired in May.**\n\nCarolyn hired 40 employees in May, and each employee worked 40 hours per week. There are 4 weeks in May, so the total number of hours worked by each employee in May is:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ employees} \\times 40 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 6400 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe total number of employees hired in May is:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ employees} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of employees hired in June.**\n\nIn June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Therefore, the number of employees hired in June is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 \\text{ employees} = 10 \\text{ employees} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the total number of employees hired in both months.**\n\nThe total number of employees hired in both months is:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ employees} + 10 \\text{ employees} = 50 \\text{ employees} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money paid to all employees in May and June.**\n\nEach employee worked 40 hours per week, and there are 4 weeks in May, so each employee worked:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 160 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe total number of hours worked by each employee in May is:\n\\[ 160 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe total number of hours worked by each employee in June is:\n\\[ 160 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe total number of hours worked by all employees in May is:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ employees} \\times 160 \\text{ hours/employee} = 8000 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe total number of hours worked by all employees in",
    "answer": "When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.\nThe total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400\nPaying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.\nIn June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.\nThe total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.\nThe total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000\nIn the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000\n#### 168000"
