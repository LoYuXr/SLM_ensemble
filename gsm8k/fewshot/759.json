    "question": "The number of songs in a playlist is 300. If John has 20 such playlists, and each song is 10 hours long, how many hours will the 20 playlists last in total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total duration of the 20 playlists, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of songs in all 20 playlists.\n2. Determine the total duration of all the songs in hours.\n\nFirst, we know that each playlist contains 300 songs and there are 20 such playlists. Therefore, the total number of songs is:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ songs/playback} \\times 20 \\text{ playbacks} = 6000 \\text{ songs} \\]\n\nNext, we know that each song is 10 hours long. Therefore, the total duration of all the songs is:\n\\[ 6000 \\text{ songs} \\times 10 \\text{ hours/song} = 60000 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, the total duration of the 20 playlists is:\n\\[ \\boxed{60000} \\]",
    "answer": "Since each playlist has 300 songs, the total number of songs in the 20 playlists is 20*300= <<20*300=6000>>6000.\nIf each song is 10 hours long, the 6000 songs in the 20 playlists last a total of 6000*10 = <<6000*10=60000>>60000 hours\n#### 60000"
