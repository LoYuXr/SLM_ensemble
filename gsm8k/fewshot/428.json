    "question": "A food caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests. While most people would only eat one hotdog, he prepared enough for half of the guests to be able to have two hotdogs. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. How many guests did not get a second hotdog?",
    "completion": "To determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed:**\n   - The caterer prepared gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests.\n   - Half of the guests will be able to have two hotdogs each.\n   - Therefore, half of the guests will have two hotdogs each.\n   - Number of guests with two hotdogs = \\( \\frac{36}{2} = 18 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of hot dogs prepared:**\n   - Total number of hot dogs = 36.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed:**\n   - Total number of hot dogs needed = Number of guests with two hotdogs + Number of guests with one hotdog.\n   - Total number of hot dogs needed = 18 + 18 = 36.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of hot dogs prepared:**\n   - Number of hot dogs prepared = Total number of hot dogs needed.\n   - Number of hot dogs prepared = 36.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of hot dogs not prepared:**\n   - Number of hot dogs not prepared = Total number of hot dogs prepared - Total number of hot dogs needed.\n   - Number of hot dogs not prepared = 36 - 36 = 0.\n\nTherefore, 0 guests did not get a second hotdog.",
    "answer": "The food caterer prepared an additional 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 hot dogs.\nAltogether, he prepared 36 + 18 = <<36+18=54>>54 hotdogs.\nIf 40 people wanted seconds, he would have needed 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 hot dogs.\n80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 people did not get second hotdogs.\n#### 26"
