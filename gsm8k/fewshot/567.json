    "question": "The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 in exchange for the first tooth Sharon lost.  Then, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each of the next three teeth Sharon lost.  And for each of the last 2 teeth Sharon lost, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth.  How much money did the tooth fairy leave Sharon, in dollars?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the total amount of money she received for the teeth she lost. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Amount**: Sharon received $5.00 in the first tooth.\n2. **Amount for the Next Three Teeth**: The tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each of the next three teeth. So, the total for these three teeth is:\n   \\[\n   1.00 \\times 3 = 3.00 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n3. **Amount for the Last Two Teeth**: For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since Sharon received $1.00 for each of the next three teeth, she received $0.50 for each of the last two teeth. Therefore, the total for these two teeth is:\n   \\[\n   0.50 \\times 2 = 1.00 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum up all the amounts:\n\\[\n5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is \\(\\boxed{9.00}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "She got $1.00 on three teeth so she got 1*3 = $<<1*3=3.00>>3.00\nOn the next two, she got 1/2 the amount of $1.00 so she received 1*.5 = $<<1*.5=0.50>>0.50\nShe received $0.50 on 2 teeth so she received .50*2 = $<<.50*2=1.00>>1.00\nWhen you add her first tooth that was $5.00, $3.00 for the next 3 and $1.00 on the next 2 she made 5+3+1 = $<<5+3+1=9.00>>9.00\n#### 9"
