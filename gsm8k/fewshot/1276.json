    "question": "James wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party. His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence. The perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) \\]\n\nHere, the length of the fence is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (20 + 15) \\]\n\\[ P = 2 \\times 35 \\]\n\\[ P = 70 \\]\n\nTherefore, James needs to buy \\(\\boxed{70}\\) feet of crepe paper.",
    "answer": "First figure out how much crepe paper James needs for the long sides. Since there are two long sides, multiple the side's length by 2: 20 feet * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 feet\nNow do the same multiplication to find out how much crepe paper James needs for the short sides: 15 feet * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 feet\nNow add the amounts for the short and long sides together to find the total amount of crepe paper needed: 40 feet + 30 feet = <<40+30=70>>70 feet\n#### 70"
