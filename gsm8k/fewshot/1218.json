    "question": "Cedar Falls Middle School has students in grades 4 \u2013 7 and each year they are challenged to earn as many Accelerated Reader points as they can. The 10 students in each grade with the most points get to try an escape room set up by the teachers. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. They have 45 minutes to try and escape. If every group uses their full 45 minutes, how long will it take for everyone to try the escape room?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it will take for all 10 students in each grade to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of students in each grade:**\n   - Cedar Falls Middle School has 4 grades.\n   - Each grade has 7 students.\n   - Therefore, the total number of students is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ grades} \\times 7 \\text{ students/grade} = 28 \\text{ students}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of students trying the escape room per group:**\n   - Each group uses 45 minutes to try the escape room.\n   - Since there are 8 students in each group, the number of students per group is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{45 \\text{ minutes}}{8 \\text{ students}} = 5.625 \\text{ students}\n     \\]\n   - Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each group can have 5 students.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of groups needed:**\n   - There are 10 students in each grade.\n   - Therefore, the total number of groups is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\text{ students/grade} \\times 4 \\text{ grades} = 40 \\text{ groups}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the total time required for all groups to try the escape room:**\n   - Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room.\n   - Therefore, the total time required for all 40 groups is:\n     \\[\n     40 \\text{ groups} \\times 45 \\text{ minutes/group} = 1800 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n   - Therefore, the total time in hours is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1800 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\nThus, it will take **30 hours** for all 10 students in each grade to try the escape room.",
    "answer": "There are 4 grades in the middle school x 10 students = <<4*10=40>>40 students who get to try the escape room.\nThere will be 40 students / 8 students in a group = <<40/8=5>>5 groups who get to try the escape room.\nIt will take 5 groups x 45 minutes = <<5*45=225>>225 minutes.\n#### 225"
