    "question": "Janet is collecting the results of Herbert Hoover Elementary School's annual standardized test. 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, along with 40 out of 100 fourth graders. The 400 fifth graders had a pass rate that was twice the fourth grades' pass rate. What is the school's overall pass rate?",
    "completion": "To determine the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the number of students who passed and the total number of students, and then find the pass rate as a percentage.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:\n- Third-graders: 340 out of 500\n- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100\n- Fifth-graders: 400 out of 100\n\nNext, we calculate the pass rates for each grade:\n- Third-graders' pass rate: \\(\\frac{340}{500} = 0.68\\) or 68%\n- Fourth-graders' pass rate: \\(\\frac{40}{100} = 0.40\\) or 40%\n- Fifth-graders' pass rate: \\(\\frac{400}{100} = 40\\%\\) or 40%\n\nNow, we sum the pass rates of all grades to get the overall pass rate:\n\\[\n0.68 + 0.40 + 0.40 = 1.48\n\\]\n\nTo find the overall pass rate as a percentage, we multiply the total number of students by the overall pass rate:\n\\[\n1.48 \\times 100\\% = 148\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the school's overall pass rate is \\(\\boxed{148\\%}\\).",
    "answer": "First find the pass rate for the fourth graders: 40 students / 100 students = <<40/100=.4>>.4\nThen double that to find the pass rate for the fifth graders: .4 * 2 = <<.4*2=.8>>.8\nThen multiply the fifth graders' pass rate by the number of fifth graders to find the total number of fifth graders who passed: .8 * 400 fifth graders = <<.8*400=320>>320 fifth graders\nNow add up the number of passing students from each grade to find to find the total number of passing students: 320 students + 40 students + 340 students = <<320+40+340=700>>700 students\nAdd up the total number of students in each grade to find the total number of students: 400 students + 100 students + 500 students = <<400+100+500=1000>>1000 students\nFinally, divide the number of passing students by the total number of students and multiply by 100% to find the total number who passed: 700 students / 1000 students * 100% = 70%\n#### 70"
