    "question": "Caroline has 4 children.  The first child is 6 feet tall.  The second child is two inches taller than the first child.  The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.  And the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.  How tall is the fourth child, in inches?",
    "completion": "To determine the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each of the first three children and then find the height of the fourth child.\n\n1. **First child's height:**\n   The first child is given as 6 feet tall.\n   Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we convert the height to inches:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 72 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second child's height:**\n   The second child is two inches taller than the first child.\n   \\[\n   72 \\text{ inches} + 2 \\text{ inches} = 74 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third child's height:**\n   The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.\n   \\[\n   74 \\text{ inches} - 5 \\text{ inches} = 69 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fourth child's height:**\n   The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.\n   \\[\n   69 \\text{ inches} + 3 \\text{ inches} = 72 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the height of the fourth child is \\(\\boxed{72}\\) inches.",
    "answer": "The six-foot-tall first child is 12*6=<<6*12=72>>72 inches tall.\nThe second child is two inches taller than the first child, or 72+2=<<72+2=74>>74 inches tall.\nThe third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, or 74-5=<<74-5=69>>69 inches tall.\nAnd the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, or 69+3=<<69+3=72>>72 inches tall.\n#### 72"
