    "question": "Gene is sewing a quilt out of old souvenir t-shirts. He has one shirt from each vacation he has been on. Every shirt is its own quilt block. Each row is made of blocks from a different year of vacations. He goes on four vacations a year and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old. He is now 34. How many quilt blocks does he have in total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing:**\n   Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old. He is now 34 years old, so he has been vacationing for:\n   \\[\n   34 - 23 = 11 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of years Gene has been on each vacation:**\n   Gene goes on four vacations a year. Therefore, the number of years he has been on each vacation is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{11 \\text{ years}}{4 \\text{ years per vacation}} = 2.75 \\text{ years per vacation}\n   \\]\n   Since the number of years must be a whole number, we need to consider the practicality of this division. However, for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that the division is exact, and Gene has been on each vacation for 2 full years and then 1 additional year.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of quilt blocks for each year of vacation:**\n   Each year of vacation corresponds to a quilt block. Since Gene has been on each vacation for 2 years, the number of quilt blocks for each year is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ years} \\times 1 \\text{ quilt block per year} = 2 \\text{ quilt blocks}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of quilt blocks:**\n   Since Gene has been on each of the 11 vacations for 2 years, the total number of quilt blocks is:\n   \\[\n   11 \\text{ vacations} \\times 2 \\text{ quilt blocks per vacation} = 22 \\text{ quilt blocks}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{22}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Gene has been on 34 - 23 = <<34-23=11>>11 years of vacations, so he has 11 rows of blocks.\nHe goes on 4 vacations a year, so he has been on 4 * 11 = <<4*11=44>>44 vacations.\nGene has 1 shirt from each vacation, so he has 44 * 1 = <<44*1=44>>44 quilt blocks in all.\n#### 44"
