    "question": "Seven bottles of soda cost $21.00 while 4 bottles of water cost $8. If David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, how much will that cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of 3 bottles of soda.\n2. Calculate the cost of 2 bottles of water.\n3. Add the costs from steps 1 and 2 to get the total cost.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of 3 bottles of soda. We know that 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00. Therefore, the cost of 3 bottles of soda is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of 3 bottles of soda} = \\frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find the cost of 2 bottles of water. We know that 4 bottles of water cost $8.00. Therefore, the cost of 2 bottles of water is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of 2 bottles of water} = \\frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the costs of the soda and the water to get the total cost:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00\n\\]\n\nSo, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5.00}\n\\]",
    "answer": "One bottle of soda costs $21.00/7 = $<<21/7=3.00>>3.00.\nThree bottles of soda cost $3.00 x 3 = $<<3*3=9.00>>9.00.\nOne bottle of water costs $8.00/4 = $<<8/4=2.00>>2.00.\nTwo bottles of water cost $2.00x 2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00.\nTherefore, 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water cost $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.\n#### 13"
