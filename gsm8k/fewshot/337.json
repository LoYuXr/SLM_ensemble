    "question": "Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke. John ate half the amount Thomas ate. How many more hot dogs did John eat than Luke?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate:**\n   Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of hot dogs Thomas ate} = 3 \\times 2 = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of hot dogs John ate:**\n   John ate half the amount Thomas ate.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of hot dogs John ate} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = \\text{Number of hot dogs John ate} - \\text{Number of hot dogs Luke ate} = 3 - 2 = 1\n   \\]\n\nThus, John ate \\(\\boxed{1}\\) more hot dog than Luke.",
    "answer": "Thomas ate 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 hot dogs.\nJohn ate 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 hot dogs.\nJohn ate 3 - 2 = <<3-2=1>>1 more hot dog than Luke.\n#### 1"
