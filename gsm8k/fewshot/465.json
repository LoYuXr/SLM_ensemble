    "question": "Miss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?",
    "completion": "To determine how many students Miss Maria has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has.\n2. Calculate the total number of baseball cards Miss Maria has.\n3. Determine the total number of cards Miss Maria has.\n4. Calculate the number of students based on the total number of cards and the number of cards each student gets.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards:\nMiss Maria has 6 decks with 25 basketball cards each.\n\\[ 6 \\times 25 = 150 \\text{ basketball cards} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards:\nMiss Maria has 5 boxes with 40 baseball cards each.\n\\[ 5 \\times 40 = 200 \\text{ baseball cards} \\]\n\nNow, let's determine the total number of cards Miss Maria has:\n\\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \\text{ cards} \\]\n\nMiss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself. Therefore, the number of cards she gives to her students is:\n\\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \\text{ cards} \\]\n\nIf each student gets 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is:\n\\[ \\frac{300}{10} = 30 \\]\n\nThus, the number of students Miss Maria has is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
    "answer": "There are 6 x 25 = <<6*25=150>>150 basketball cards.\nAnd, there are 5 x 40 = <<5*40=200>>200 baseball cards.\nThus, Miss Maria has 150 + 200 = <<150+200=350>>350 sports cards.\nShe gave a total of 350 - 50 = <<350-50=300>>300 cards to her students.\nTherefore, Miss Maria has 300/10 = <<300/10=30>>30 students.\n#### 30"
