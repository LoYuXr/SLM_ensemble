    "question": "Alison qualified for a spot on the running team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a tank top for $10, a pair of running shorts for $5 more than the top cost, and a pair of tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for $2 off the package of $8 athletic socks that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item she bought and then sum these costs.\n\n1. **Cost of the tank top:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of tank top} = \\$10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cost of the pair of running shorts:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of shorts} = \\text{Cost of tank top} + \\$5 = \\$10 + \\$5 = \\$15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of the pair of tennis shoes:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of tennis shoes} = \\text{Original price} - \\text{Sale price} = \\$48 - \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\$48 = \\$48 - \\$24 = \\$24\n   \\]\n\n4. **Cost of the socks:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of socks} = \\$8\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum the costs of all the items:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of tank top} + \\text{Cost of shorts} + \\text{Cost of tennis shoes} + \\text{Cost of socks}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\$10 + \\$15 + \\$24 + \\$8\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\$67\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Alison spent a total of \\(\\boxed{67}\\) dollars on athletic gear.",
    "answer": "The shorts were $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $5 + $10 = $<<5+10=15>>15.\nHer tennis shoes were half the original $68 price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.\nWith her coupon, the socks were $8 - $2 = $<<8-2=6>>6.\nThe shirt, shorts, shoes, and socks together cost $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $<<10+15+24+6=55>>55.\n#### 55"
