    "question": "A nurses\u2019 station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?",
    "completion": "To determine how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to work backwards from the information given about the number of bandages used and left at the end of each day.\n\nLet's denote the number of bandages used on the first day as \\( B_1 \\), the number of bandages used on the second day as \\( B_2 \\), and the number of bandages used on the third day as \\( B_3 \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. On the first day, they used 38 bandages.\n2. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than on the first day, so \\( B_2 = 38 - 10 = 28 \\).\n3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack, so \\( B_3 = 2 \\times 2 + 0.5 = 4.5 \\). Since the number of bandages must be a whole number, we assume they used 4 bandages (as they can't use half a pack).\n\nNow, we know the number of bandages used on the first day, the second day, and the third day. We can use these to find the total number of bandages used and left at the end of the third day.\n\nThe total number of bandages used is:\n\\[ B_1 + B_2 + B_3 = 38 + 28 + 4 = 60 \\]\n\nThe number of bandages left at the end of the third day is 78. Therefore, the total number of bandages used plus the bandages left is:\n\\[ B_1 + B_2 + B_3 + 78 = 60 + 78 = 138 \\]\n\nSince the nurses ordered bandages in bulk packs of 50, the total number of bandages ordered is:\n\\[ \\frac{138}{50} = 2.76 \\]\n\nSince the number of bandages must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the nurses used 60 bandages, and the bandages left at the end of the third day is 78, which means they used 2 bandages (since 78 divided by 50 is 1.58, and they can't use half a pack, so they used ",
    "answer": "Let B be the number of bandages the nurses\u2019 station started with.\nOn the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 50, so they had B - 38 + 50 = B + 12 bandages left.\nOn the second day, they used 38 - 10 = <<38-10=28>>28 bandages.\nThus, at the end of the second day, they had B + 12 - 28 = B - 16 bandages left.\nOn the third day, they ordered 100 bandages and used half a pack, so they used 50 / 2 = 25.\nThus, on the third day, they had B - 16 + 100 - 25 = B + 59 bandages left.\nAt the end of the third day, they had 78 = B + 59 bandages left.\nThus, on the first day, they started with B = 78 - 59 = <<19=19>>19 bandages.\n#### 19"
