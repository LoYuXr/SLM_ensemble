    "question": "Brook Hills High School currently enrolls 3000 students. Half of these students are over 16 years old, and one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, and one-half of the students under 16 are male. In total, how many female students are enrolled at this school?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students over 16 years old.\n2. Determine the number of male students over 16 years old.\n3. Determine the number of female students over 16 years old.\n4. Determine the number of male students under 16 years old.\n5. Determine the number of female students under 16 years old.\n6. Sum the number of female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old to get the total number of female students.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The total number of students is 3000. Half of these students are over 16 years old:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students over 16 years old} = \\frac{3000}{2} = 1500\n   \\]\n\n2. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of male students over 16 years old} = \\frac{1500}{4} = 375\n   \\]\n\n3. The remaining half of the students over 16 years old are female:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of female students over 16 years old} = 1500 - 375 = 1125\n   \\]\n\n4. One-half of the students under 16 years old are male:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of male students under 16 years old} = \\frac{1500}{2} = 750\n   \\]\n\n5. The remaining half of the students under 16 years old are female:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of female students under 16 years old} = 1500 - 750 = 750\n   \\]\n\n6. The total number of female students is the sum of the female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of female students enrolled at this school is \\(\\boxed{1875}\\).",
    "answer": "3000-1500=<<3000-1500=1500>>1500 students are over 16 years old.\n1500*0.25=<<1500*0.25=375>>375 students of this age are male.\n1500/2=<<1500/2=750>>750 students under 16 years of age are male.\nIn total there are 750+375=<<750+375=1125>>1125 male students enrolled.\nSo, there are 3000-1125=<<3000-1125=1875>>1875 female students enrolled.\n#### 1,875"
