    "question": "Candy has 15 light blue spools of thread, 45 dark blue spools of thread, 40 light green spools of thread, and 50 dark green spools of thread. What percent of her spools are blue?",
    "completion": "To determine what percent of Candy's spools are blue, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of spools of thread.\n2. Determine the total number of blue spools.\n3. Calculate the percentage of blue spools out of the total number of spools.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of spools of thread:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ (light blue)} + 45 \\text{ (dark blue)} + 40 \\text{ (light green)} + 50 \\text{ (dark green)} = 150 \\text{ spools}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of blue spools:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ (light blue)} + 45 \\text{ (dark blue)} = 60 \\text{ blue spools}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the percentage of blue spools out of the total number of spools:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{60}{150} \\right) \\times 100 = 40\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the percent of her spools that are blue is \\boxed{40}.",
    "answer": "First find the number of blue spools: 15 spools + 45 spools = <<15+45=60>>60 spools\nThen find the total number of spools: 40 spools + 50 spools + 60 spools = <<40+50+60=150>>150 spools\nThen divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 60 spools / 150 spools * 100% = 40%\n#### 40"
