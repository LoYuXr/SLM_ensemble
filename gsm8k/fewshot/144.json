    "question": "Kim has started his own housekeeping business and is calculating how much profit he will make from his clients. He already has 3 clients, but is talking to another 5 potential clients and feels confident enough to include them in his calculations. Each client\u2019s home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. Bottles of bleach will cost $2 each and packs of cloths will cost $5 each. These are his only expenses. He calculates that his total income each week will be $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?",
    "completion": "To calculate Lucas's profit, we need to determine both his total income and his total expenses, and then find the difference between the two.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths needed:\n- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach.\n- Each client needs 1 pack of cloths.\n\nWith 3 clients, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ clients} \\times 2 \\text{ bottles per client} = 6 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nWith 5 potential clients, the total number of packs of cloths needed is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ clients} \\times 1 \\text{ pack per client} = 5 \\text{ packs} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the items needed:\n- The cost of bottles of bleach is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ bottles} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per bottle} = \\$12 \\]\n\n- The cost of packs of cloths is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ packs} \\times \\$5 \\text{ per pack} = \\$25 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total expenses:\n\\[ \\$12 \\text{ (bleach)} + \\$25 \\text{ (cloths)} = \\$37 \\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total income:\n\\[ \\$92 \\text{ (income per week)} \\]\n\nThe profit is the difference between the total income and the total expenses:\n\\[ \\$92 - \\$37 = \\$55 \\]\n\nTherefore, Lucas's profit each week will be $55.",
    "answer": "Lucas counts a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients.\nEach week, he will need a total of 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach.\nEach week, he will also need a total of 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths.\nThe bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.\nThe packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.\nSo each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.\nHis profit will therefore be $92 total income - $72 total expenses = $<<92-72=20>>20.\n#### 20"
