    "question": "Bill is trying to dig a well in his backyard. He can dig 4 feet/hour through soil and half that fast through clay. If he has to dig through 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay, how long will it take him to dig the well?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to dig through both the soil and the clay separately, and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil:\n- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.\n- He has 24 feet of soil to dig.\n- The time to dig the soil is given by the formula: time = distance / speed.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time to dig soil} = \\frac{24 \\text{ feet}}{4 \\text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay:\n- Bill digs half the speed of digging through soil through clay.\n- He digs 4 feet per hour through clay.\n- He has 8 feet of clay to dig.\n- The time to dig the clay is given by the formula: time = distance / speed.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time to dig clay} = \\frac{8 \\text{ feet}}{4 \\text{ feet/hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the times for both the soil and the clay to find the total time it takes to dig the well:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\text{Time to dig soil} + \\text{Time to dig clay} = 6 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 8 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Bill \\boxed{8} hours to dig the well.",
    "answer": "First find how fast Bill can dig through clay: 4 feet/hour / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 feet/hour\nThen find how long he spends digging through clay in total: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = <<8/2=4>>4 hours\nThen find how long he spends digging through soil in total: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = <<24/4=6>>6 hours\nThen add the time he spends digging through soil and clay to find the total digging time: 4 hours + 6 hours = <<4+6=10>>10 hours\n#### 10"
