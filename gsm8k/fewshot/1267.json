    "question": "A farm has 10 2-legged animals and 15 4-legged animals. If all animals are healthy, how many pairs of animal legs in total are on the farm?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the number of legs contributed by the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of legs from the 2-legged animals:\n- There are 10 2-legged animals.\n- Each 2-legged animal has 2 legs.\n- Therefore, the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals is \\(10 \\times 2 = 20\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of legs from the 4-legged animals:\n- There are 15 4-legged animals.\n- Each 4-legged animal has 4 legs.\n- Therefore, the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals is \\(15 \\times 4 = 60\\).\n\nNow, we add the number of legs from the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals to get the total number of legs on the farm:\n- The total number of legs is \\(20 + 60 = 80\\).\n\nSince each pair of legs consists of 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the number of pairs:\n- The number of pairs of legs is \\(\\frac{80}{2} = 40\\).\n\nThus, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
    "answer": "2-legged animals have 2 legs. Therefore 10 2-legged animals will have 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 legs\n4-legged animals have 4 legs. Therefore 15 4-legged animals will have 15*4=<<15*4=60>>60 legs\nIn total there are 20+60= <<20+60=80>>80 legs\nA pair of legs equals 2 legs. If there are 80 legs on the farm, there will be 80/2= <<80/2=40>>40 pairs of legs\n#### 40"
