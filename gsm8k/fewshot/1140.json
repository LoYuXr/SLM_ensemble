    "question": "Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.  If it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, how many potatoes did Gomer eat?",
    "completion": "To determine how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \\]\n\nSo, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer used to make 18 scoops. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. So, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \\]\n\nSo, Gomer used 3 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer used to make 18 scoops. Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3 \\text{ potatoes}}{1 \\text{ less than 3 scoops}} = \\frac{x \\text{ potatoes}}{18 \\text{ scoops}} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{3 \\times 18}{1} = 54 \\]\n\nSo, Gomer used 54 potatoes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.\n\nTherefore, the number of potatoes Gomer ate is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
    "answer": "5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes is 23-5=<<23-5=18>>18 scoops of mashed potatoes.\n3 less than 6 potatoes is 6-3=<<6-3=3>>3 potatoes.\n1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes is 3-1=<<3-1=2>>2 scoops of mashed potatoes.\nThus, if Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, and it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes, then Gomer ate 18*(3/2)=<<18*(3/2)=27>>27 potatoes.\n#### 27"
