    "question": "Brian's basement was damp and musty, so he bought a dehumidifier to remove moisture out of the air.  The device has three speeds: low, medium, and high.   Brian tested the device's efficiency and he found that the low setting removes 1 liter of water out of the air per day, the medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, and the high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.  If Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, then an additional 3 days on the medium setting, and then an additional 5 days on the high setting, what is the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement, in liters?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier over the specified days, we need to calculate the amount of water removed per day for each setting and then sum these amounts over the total number of days.\n\n1. **Low setting:**\n   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.\n\n2. **Medium setting:**\n   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.\n   - Therefore, the medium setting removes \\( 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\) liters of water per day.\n\n3. **High setting:**\n   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.\n   - Therefore, the high setting removes \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\) liters of water per day.\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of water removed over the specified days:\n\n- **Low setting for 3 days:**\n  \\[\n  3 \\text{ days} \\times 1 \\text{ liter/day} = 3 \\text{ liters}\n  \\]\n\n- **Medium setting for 3 days:**\n  \\[\n  3 \\text{ days} \\times 2 \\text{ liters/day} = 6 \\text{ liters}\n  \\]\n\n- **High setting for 5 days:**\n  \\[\n  5 \\text{ days} \\times 4 \\text{ liters/day} = 20 \\text{ liters}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the amounts of water removed over all the days:\n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ liters} + 6 \\text{ liters} + 20 \\text{ liters} = 29 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is \\(\\boxed{29}\\) liters.",
    "answer": "The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, for a total of 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 liters of water per day.\nThe high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, for a total of 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 liters of water per day.\n3 days on the low setting removes 3*1=<<3*1=3>>3 liters of water.\n3 days on the medium setting removes 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 liters of water.\nAnd 5 days on the high setting removes 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 liters of water.\nIn total, the dehumidifier removed 3+6+20=<<3+6+20=29>>29 liters of water from the air in his basement.\n#### 29"
