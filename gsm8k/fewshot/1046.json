    "question": "A team of 4 painters worked on a mansion for 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks. How many hours of work did each painter put in?",
    "completion": "To determine how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of days in 3 weeks.\n2. Determine the total number of days the painters worked.\n3. Calculate the total number of hours worked by all painters.\n4. Divide the total number of hours by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of days in 3 weeks:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ weeks} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 21 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the total number of days the painters worked:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{8} \\text{ of a day} \\times 21 \\text{ days} = \\frac{3 \\times 21}{8} = \\frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the total number of hours worked by all painters:\n   \\[\n   7.875 \\text{ days} \\times 24 \\text{ hours/day} = 188.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. Divide the total number of hours by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{188.5 \\text{ hours}}{4 \\text{ painters}} = 47.125 \\text{ hours/painter}\n   \\]\n\nSo, each painter put in \\(\\boxed{47.125}\\) hours of work.",
    "answer": "There are 24 hours in a day so 3/8ths of a day is (3/8)*24 = <<3/8*24=9>>9 hours\nOne week has 7 days so 3 weeks have 7*3 = <<7*3=21>>21 days\nEach painter put in 9*21 = <<9*21=189>>189 hours of work\n#### 189"
