    "question": "100 people apply for a job at Google. Of the people that apply, only 30% receive interviews. Of those who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer. Of those who receive a job offer, a third of the people accept the position. How many people accept the position?",
    "completion": "To determine how many people accept the position, we need to follow the steps of the problem carefully.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of people who receive interviews:**\n   - 30% of the 100 people apply for the job.\n   \\[\n   0.30 \\times 100 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, 30 people receive interviews.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of people who receive a job offer:**\n   - 20% of the 30 people who receive interviews receive a job offer.\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 30 = 6\n   \\]\n   So, 6 people receive a job offer.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of people who accept the position:**\n   - A third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, 2 people accept the position.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who accept the position is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
    "answer": "The number of people that receive interviews is 100 * 0.30 = <<100*0.30=30>>30 people\nThe number of people that receive a job offer is 30 * 0.20 = <<30*0.20=6>>6 people\nThe number of people that accept the position is 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 people\n#### 2"
