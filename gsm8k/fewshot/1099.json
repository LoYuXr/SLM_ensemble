    "question": "The biggest waterslide at Five Flags is 300 feet long, and people slide down at 60 feet/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 80 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?",
    "completion": "To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest waterslide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference between these times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest waterslide:\n- The length of the biggest waterslide is 300 feet.\n- The speed at which people slide down is 60 feet per minute.\n\nThe time \\( t_1 \\) to slide down the biggest waterslide is given by the formula:\n\\[\nt_1 = \\frac{\\text{length}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{300 \\text{ feet}}{60 \\text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest waterslide:\n- The length of the second biggest waterslide is 240 feet.\n- The speed at which people slide down is 80 feet per minute.\n\nThe time \\( t_2 \\) to slide down the second biggest waterslide is given by the formula:\n\\[\nt_2 = \\frac{\\text{length}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{240 \\text{ feet}}{80 \\text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in time between the second biggest waterslide and the biggest waterslide:\n\\[\nt_2 - t_1 = 3 \\text{ minutes} - 5 \\text{ minutes} = -2 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nSince the result is negative, it indicates that the second biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes less than the biggest waterslide. Therefore, the second biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes less than the biggest waterslide.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
    "answer": "First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = <<300/60=5>>5 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = <<240/80=3>>3 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = <<5-3=2>>2 minutes\n#### 2"
