    "question": "At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. How many women are left if 22 men stayed at the party?",
    "completion": "To determine how many women are left at the party, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of people at the party initially.\n2. Determine how many people left after an hour.\n3. Calculate the number of people who stayed at the party.\n4. Determine how many women stayed at the party.\n5. Calculate the number of women who left the party.\n\nLet's start with the initial number of people at the party:\n- There were 25 men.\n- There were 15 women.\n- Therefore, the total number of people at the party initially is \\(25 + 15 = 40\\).\n\nNext, we calculate how many people left after an hour:\n- 1/4 of the total number of people left, so the number of people who left is \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10\\).\n\nNow, we calculate the number of people who stayed at the party:\n- The number of people who stayed is the total number of people at the party minus the number of people who left, which is \\(40 - 10 = 30\\).\n\nWe know that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's denote the number of women who stayed at the party as \\(W\\). The total number of people who stayed at the party is the sum of the men and women who stayed, which is \\(22 + W\\). Since the total number of people who stayed at the party is 30, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[22 + W = 30\\]\nSolving for \\(W\\), we get:\n\\[W = 30 - 22 = 8\\]\nSo, 8 women stayed at the party.\n\nFinally, we calculate the number of women who left the party:\n- The number of women who left is the total number of women at the party minus the number of women who stayed, which is \\(15 - 8 = 7\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of women who left the party is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
    "answer": "There were a total of 25 men + 15 women = <<25+15=40>>40 people who attended the party.\nAfter an hour, 40 people / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 people left the party.\nThis means 40 people - 10 people = <<40-10=30>>30 people stayed.\nOut of the 30 who stayed, 30 people - 22 men = <<30-22=8>>8 were women.\n#### 8"
