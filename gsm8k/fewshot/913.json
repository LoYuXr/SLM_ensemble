    "question": "Benny threw bologna at his balloons.  He threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon and three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.  If Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons, and twenty of the balloons were red, then how many of the balloons in the bundle were yellow?",
    "completion": "To determine how many of the balloons in the bundle were yellow, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of pieces of bologna thrown:**\n   Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.\n\n2. **Determine the number of pieces of bologna thrown per balloon:**\n   Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna per red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna per yellow balloon.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of red balloons:**\n   Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna per red balloon, and there are 20 red balloons.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of red balloons} = 2 \\times 20 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of yellow balloons:**\n   Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna per yellow balloon, and there are \\(58 - 40 = 18\\) pieces of bologna left.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of yellow balloons} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the total number of balloons:**\n   The total number of balloons is the sum of the red and yellow balloons.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of balloons} = 40 + 6 = 46\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
    "answer": "If Benny had twenty red balloons in the bundle, and he threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, then he threw 2*20=40 pieces of bologna at red balloons in the bundle.\nIf he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at balloons in the bundle, then he threw 58-40=<<58-40=18>>18 pieces of bologna at yellow balloons.\nIf he threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, then he had 18/3=<<18/3=6>>6 yellow balloons.\n#### 6"
