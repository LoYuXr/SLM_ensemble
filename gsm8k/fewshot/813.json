    "question": "John and DeSean bought a bag of marshmallows to make s'mores together. The bag has 35 marshmallows. Each S'more uses one marshmallow. If John makes 9 S'mores, DeSean makes 9 S'mores, and they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, how many S'mores can each kid have with the marshmallows left in the bag?",
    "completion": "To determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of marshmallows used:**\n   - John makes 9 S'mores.\n   - DeSean makes 9 S'mores.\n   - Total marshmallows used = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18 marshmallows.\n\n2. **Determine the number of marshmallows left in the bag:**\n   - The bag originally had 35 marshmallows.\n   - Marshmallows used = 18.\n   - Marshmallows left = 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of S'mores each kid can have with the remaining marshmallows:**\n   - Each S'more uses one marshmallow.\n   - Marshmallows left = 17.\n   - Number of S'mores each kid can have = 17.\n\nThus, each kid can have \\(\\boxed{17}\\) S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.",
    "answer": "They used up 21 marshmallows because 9 plus 9 plus 3 equals <<9+9+3=21>>21.\nThere are 14 marshmallows left because 35 minus 21 equals <<35-21=14>>14.\nThey can each make 7 more because 14 divided by 2 equals <<14/2=7>>7.\n#### 7"
