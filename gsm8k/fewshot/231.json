    "question": "Kylie and Robert enjoy going to the beach to collect shells. On Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20 shells. On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. How many shells does Kylie collect on Tuesday?",
    "completion": "To determine how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine how many shells Robert collects on Monday.\n2. Use the number of shells Robert collects on Monday to find out how many shells Kylie collects on Monday.\n3. Use the number of shells Kylie collects on Monday to find out how many shells she collects on Tuesday.\n\nFirst, we know that Robert collects 20 shells on Monday. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can calculate the number of shells Kylie collects on Monday as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Shells collected by Kylie on Monday} = \\text{Shells collected by Robert on Monday} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday on Tuesday. Therefore, we can calculate the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Shells collected by Kylie on Tuesday} = \\text{Shells collected by Kylie on Monday} \\times 2 = 25 \\times 2 = 50 \\]\n\nSo, the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
    "answer": "On Monday, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = <<20+5=25>>25 shells\nOn Tuesday, Kylie collects 25 * 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 shells\n#### 50"
