    "question": "Nathan has a bouncy ball that bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. If he drops it from the third-floor balcony in the mall, where each story is 24 feet high, how high does the ball go on its second bounce?",
    "completion": "To determine how high the bouncy ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the starting height of the ball.\n2. Calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce.\n3. Calculate the height of the ball after the second bounce.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The starting height of the ball is 24 feet.\n\n2. After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height. So, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height after the first bounce} = 24 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 24 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 16 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. After the second bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its height after the first bounce. So, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height after the second bounce} = 16 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 16 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{32}{3} \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the height of the ball on its second bounce is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{32}{3}}\\) feet, which is approximately 10.67 feet.",
    "answer": "First find the total height from which Nathan drops the ball: 24 feet/story * 3 stories = <<24*3=72>>72 feet\nThen multiply that number by 2/3rds to find the height of the ball after one bounce: 72 feet * 2/3 = <<72*2/3=48>>48 feet\nThen multiply that number by 2/3rds to find the height of the ball after two bounces: 48 feet * 2/3 = <<48*2/3=32>>32 feet\n#### 32"
