    "question": "Jim decides to go to college to earn some more money.  It takes him 4 years to finish and he gets $50,000 in loans per year.  If he had a 25k a year job before college and his college degree tripled his income, how long would it take to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.",
    "completion": "To determine how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to break down the problem into several steps.\n\n1. **Calculate Jim's total earnings from his college loans:**\n   - Jim gets $50,000 in loans per year.\n   - It takes him 4 years to finish college.\n   - Therefore, his total earnings from college loans over 4 years is:\n     \\[\n     50,000 \\text{ dollars/year} \\times 4 \\text{ years} = 200,000 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Jim's total income from his college degree:**\n   - Jim's college degree tripled his income before college.\n   - Before college, his income was $25,000 per year.\n   - Therefore, his total income from his college degree is:\n     \\[\n     25,000 \\text{ dollars/year} \\times 3 = 75,000 \\text{ dollars/year}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total income lost from not working while in school:**\n   - Jim lost $25,000 per year while in college.\n   - Over 4 years, the total income lost is:\n     \\[\n     25,000 \\text{ dollars/year} \\times 4 \\text{ years} = 100,000 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the net income Jim earns from his college loans and the income lost from not working:**\n   - Net income is the total income from college loans minus the total income lost from not working.\n   - Therefore, the net income is:\n     \\[\n     200,000 \\text{ dollars} - 100,000 \\text{ dollars} = 100,000 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine the time it takes for Jim to earn the net income:**\n   - It takes Jim 4 years to finish college.\n   - Therefore, the time it takes for Jim to earn the net income is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ years}\n     \\]\n\nThus, it would take Jim \\boxed{4} years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while",
    "answer": "His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year\nSo he earns an extra 75,000-25,000=$<<75000-25000=50000>>50,000 a year\nHis loan cost 50,000*4=$<<50000*4=200000>>200,000\nHe lost out on 25,000*4=$<<25000*4=100000>>100,000 from not working\nSo he needs to make 200,000+100,000=$<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000\nThat means it will take 300,000/50,000=<<300000/50000=6>>6 years\n#### 4"
