    "question": "Bob is in charge of doing laundry for a large hotel. Each room has two sheets, one comforter, twice as many pillow cases as sheets and twice as many towels as pillow cases. How many pieces of laundry are there in 80 rooms?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of sheets, comforters, pillow cases, and towels in one room and then multiply by 80.\n\n1. **Number of sheets in one room:**\n   Each room has 2 sheets.\n\n2. **Number of comforters in one room:**\n   Each room has twice as many comforters as sheets. Therefore, the number of comforters is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2 = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of pillow cases in one room:**\n   Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets. Therefore, the number of pillow cases is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2 = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Number of towels in one room:**\n   Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases. Therefore, the number of towels is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 4 = 8\n   \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of pieces of laundry in one room:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ sheets} + 4 \\text{ comforters} + 4 \\text{ pillow cases} + 8 \\text{ towels} = 18 \\text{ pieces of laundry}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms:\n\\[\n18 \\text{ pieces of laundry/room} \\times 80 \\text{ rooms} = 1440 \\text{ pieces of laundry}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1440}\n\\]",
    "answer": "First find the number of pillow cases in each room: 2 sheets * 2 pillow cases/sheet = <<2*2=4>>4 pillow cases\nThen find the number of towels in each room: 4 pillow cases * 2 towels/pillow case = <<4*2=8>>8 towels\nThen find the number of pieces of laundry in each room: 4 pillow cases + 8 towels + 2 sheets + 1 comforter = <<4+8+2+1=15>>15 pieces of laundry\nThen multiply the number of pieces of laundry in each room by the number of rooms to find the total: 15 pieces of laundry/room * 80 rooms = <<15*80=1200>>1200 pieces\n#### 1200"
