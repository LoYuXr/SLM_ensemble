    "question": "Aleena subscribed to a streaming service that charges her $140 per month. If the streaming company charged her the initial amount for the first half of the year and then charged her 10% less money on the other half of the year, calculate the total amount she had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year.",
    "completion": "To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two parts: the initial amount charged for the first half of the year and the amount charged for the second half of the year.\n\n1. **Calculate the amount charged for the first half of the year:**\n   - The total monthly fee is $140.\n   - The first half of the year is 6 months.\n   - Therefore, the amount charged for the first half of the year is:\n     \\[\n     140 \\times \\frac{6}{2} = 140 \\times 3 = 420\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the amount charged for the second half of the year:**\n   - The total monthly fee is $140.\n   - The second half of the year is also 6 months.\n   - Therefore, the amount charged for the second half of the year is:\n     \\[\n     140 \\times \\frac{6}{2} = 140 \\times 3 = 420\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount paid for the streaming service by the end of the year:**\n   - The total amount paid is the sum of the amounts charged for the first half and the second half of the year:\n     \\[\n     420 + 420 = 840\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is \\(\\boxed{840}\\).",
    "answer": "A year has twelve months, so a half of the year is 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 months,\nFor the first six months, the streaming service charged her a total of 6*140 = $<<6*140=840>>840\nFor the next half of the year, the streaming service company charged her 10/100*140 = $<<10/100*140=14>>14 less\nShe paid $140-$14 = $<<140-14=126>>126 each month for the remaining half of the year,\nIn total, she paid 126*6 = $<<126*6=756>>756 for the other half of the year for the streaming service.\nThe total amount of money she paid at the end of the year is $840+$756 = $<<840+756=1596>>1596\n#### 1596"
