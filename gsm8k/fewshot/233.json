    "question": "There are 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow.  One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean.  Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner.  How many penguins are still left sunbathing?",
    "completion": "To determine how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of penguins who jump in the ocean:**\n   - There are 36 penguins sunbathing.\n   - One-third of them jump in the ocean.\n   - Number of penguins who jump in the ocean = \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 36 = 12\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the number of penguins who go inside the cave:**\n   - Another one-third of the penguins who jump in the ocean go inside the cave.\n   - Number of penguins who go inside the cave = \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the number of penguins who are left sunbathing:**\n   - Subtract the number of penguins who jump in the ocean and those who go inside the cave from the total number of penguins.\n   - Number of penguins left sunbathing = \\(36 - 12 - 4 = 20\\).\n\nThus, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
    "answer": "This many penguins are swimming: 36/3 = <<36/3=12>>12 penguins.\nThis many penguins are eating their dinner: 36/3 = <<36/3=12>>12 penguins.\nThis many penguins are not sunbathing: 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24.\nThis many penguins are still sunbathing: 36 - 24 = <<36-24=12>>12 penguins.\n#### 12"
