    "question": "Martha is planning her Christmas party. She invited 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people. 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 that number had previous commitments. How many people show up for Martha's party?",
    "completion": "To determine how many people show up for Martha's Christmas party, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of people invited.\n2. Subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness.\n3. Determine the number of people who had previous commitments.\n4. Subtract the number of people who had previous commitments from the total number of people invited.\n\nLet's start with the total number of people invited:\n- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) people.\n- Martha invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) people.\n- The total number of people invited is \\(12 + 12 = 24\\).\n\nNext, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness:\n- 8 people couldn't come due to illness, so the number of people who showed up is \\(24 - 8 = 16\\).\n\nThen, we determine the number of people who had previous commitments. The number of people who had previous commitments is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the total number of people invited:\n- The number of people who had previous commitments is \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 = 4\\).\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of people who had previous commitments from the total number of people invited to find out how many people show up:\n- The number of people who show up is \\(16 - 4 = 12\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
    "answer": "First find the total number of people from 6-person families: 2 families * 6 people/family = <<2*6=12>>12 people\nThen find the total number of people from 4-person families: 3 families * 4 people/family = <<3*4=12>>12 people\nAdd those two numbers to find the total number of people Martha invited: 12 people + 12 people = <<12+12=24>>24 people\nThen find the number of people who couldn't come because they were sick: 8 people / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 people\nThen subtract the people who couldn't come from the total to find the number who showed up: 24 people - 2 people - 8 people = <<24-2-8=14>>14 people\n#### 14"
