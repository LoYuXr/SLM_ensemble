    "question": "Audrey has to take two math tests to pass 6th grade. She must correctly answer 70% of the total questions to move on to the 7th grade. The first test has 70 questions and she gets 60% of them correct. The second test has 40 questions. How many questions does she need to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade?",
    "completion": "To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the first test to pass.\n2. Determine the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test to pass.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the first test to pass. The first test has 70 questions, and she needs to get 70% of them correct. So, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 70 \\times 0.70 = 49 \\]\n\nSo, Audrey needs to get 49 questions right on the first test to pass.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many questions she needs to get right on the second test to pass. The second test has 40 questions, and she needs to get 70% of them correct. So, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 40 \\times 0.70 = 28 \\]\n\nSo, Audrey needs to get 28 questions right on the second test to pass.\n\nTherefore, the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",
    "answer": "There are 110 questions in total because 70 + 40 = <<70+40=110>>110\nShe needs to get 77 of these right because 110 x .7 = <<110*.7=77>>77\nShe got 42 questions right on the first test because 70 x .6 = <<70*.6=42>>42\nShe needs to get 35 questions right on the second test because 77 - 42 = <<77-42=35>>35\n#### 35"
