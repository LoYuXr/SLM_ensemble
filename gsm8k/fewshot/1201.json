    "question": "There are 66 fish in the fish tank. One-third of the fish have red stripes, and 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. Altogether, how many fish have red stripes and blue stripes?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.\n2. Determine the number of fish remaining after accounting for the fish with red stripes.\n3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes among the remaining fish.\n4. Sum the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 66 = 22\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the number of fish remaining after accounting for the fish with red stripes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of fish remaining} = 66 - 22 = 44\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes among the remaining fish:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \\frac{5}{11} \\times 44 = 20\n   \\]\n\n4. Sum the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is \\boxed{42}.",
    "answer": "One-third of the fish in the fish tank have red stripes, a total of 1/3*66 = <<1/3*66=22>>22 fish\nThe number of fish in the fish tank with no red stripes is 66-22 =<<66-22=44>>44\n5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, a total of 5/11*44 = <<5/11*44=20>>20 fish\nAltogether, the number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is 20+22 = <<20+22=42>>42 fish\n#### 42"
