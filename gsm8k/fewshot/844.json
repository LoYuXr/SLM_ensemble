    "question": "Peter has twice as many socks as Jack and half times as many dishes as jack. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store. If jack collected 60 dishes, calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of socks and dishes that Peter and Jack have together, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of socks Jack has:**\n   - Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks.\n   - Jack collected 60 dishes.\n   - Let \\( S \\) represent the number of socks Jack has.\n   - According to the problem, \\( 2S = 60 \\).\n   - Solving for \\( S \\):\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, Jack has 30 socks.\n\n2. **Determine the number of dishes Peter has:**\n   - Peter has half the number of dishes as Jack.\n   - Jack has 60 dishes.\n   - Therefore, Peter has:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\text{ dishes}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of socks and dishes:**\n   - Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes.\n   - Peter has 30 socks and 30 dishes.\n   - Adding these together:\n     \\[\n     30 \\text{ (Jack's socks)} + 60 \\text{ (Jack's dishes)} + 30 \\text{ (Peter's socks)} + 30 \\text{ (Peter's dishes)} = 150\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of socks and dishes that Peter and Jack have together is \\(\\boxed{150}\\).",
    "answer": "Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, he has 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 socks.\nIn total, he has 30+60 = <<30+60=90>>90 socks and dishes.\nPeter has twice as many socks as jack which totals 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 socks.\nHe also has half times as many dishes as Jack which is 1/2*60 = 30 dishes.\nIn total, he has 60+30 = <<60+30=90>>90 socks and dishes.\nThe total number of socks and dishes they both have is 90+90 = <<90+90=180>>180\n#### 180"
