    "question": "Judy bought a dozen cups and twice as many dishes as cups to take to the church's charity event. At the event, she found out that her friend had brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than she had brought. What's the total number of utensils brought by the two?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of utensils Judy and her friend brought to the charity event, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of dishes Judy brought.\n2. Determine the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought.\n3. Add the number of cups and dishes Judy brought to find the total number of utensils.\n\nFirst, we know that Judy bought a dozen cups. Since a dozen is 12, Judy brought 12 cups.\n\nNext, we know that Judy brought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she brought 12 cups, she brought \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) dishes.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many cups and dishes Judy's friend brought. Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Therefore, Judy's friend brought \\(40 + 20 = 60\\) dishes.\n\nTo find the total number of utensils, we add the number of cups and dishes Judy brought to the number of cups and dishes her friend brought. So, the total number of utensils is \\(12 + 24 + 60 = 96\\).\n\nThus, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
    "answer": "Judy brought a dozen cups, which is <<12=12>>12.\nJudy's number of plates was twice as many as cups which totals 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24\nAll the utensils brought by Judy is 24 dishes+12 cups = <<24+12=36>>36\nHer friend brought 24+ 20 = <<24+20=44>>44 dishes.\nThe total number of utensils brought by Judy's friend is 44 dishes+40 cups = <<44+40=84>>84\nWhen they combined their utensils, they brought together 84+36 = <<84+36=120>>120\n#### 120"
