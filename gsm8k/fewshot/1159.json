    "question": "Carla just gave birth to identical octuplets. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. If all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, what is the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple?",
    "completion": "To determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of baby wearing purple:**\n   Carla dresses 3/4 of the baby in purple. Since there are 3 baby in total, the number of baby wearing purple is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} \\times 3 = \\frac{9}{4} = 2.25\n   \\]\n   Since the number of babies must be a whole number, we assume the problem implies rounding to the nearest whole number, which is 2 babies wearing purple.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of baby wearing blue:**\n   Carla dresses 1/4 of the baby in blue. The number of baby wearing blue is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 3 = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\n   \\]\n   Again, assuming the problem implies rounding to the nearest whole number, which is 1 baby wearing blue.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of baby wearing bows:**\n   Carla dresses 1/3 of the baby in bows. The number of baby wearing bows is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 3 = 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of baby wearing bows:**\n   The total number of baby wearing bows is the sum of the babies wearing purple, blue, and bows:\n   \\[\n   2 + 1 + 1 = 4\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of baby wearing purple and blue:**\n   The total number of baby wearing purple and blue is the sum of the babies wearing purple and the babies wearing blue:\n   \\[\n   2 + 1 = 3\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:**\n   The percentage chance is the number of babies wearing purple divided by the total number of babies, multiplied by 100:\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) \\times 100 = 66.67\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is \\(\\boxed{66.67}\\).",
    "answer": "First find the number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 babies = <<3/4*8=6>>6 babies\nThen multiply that number by 1/3 to find the number of babies wearing purple and bows: 6 babies * 1/3 = <<6*1/3=2>>2 babies\nThen subtract the number of purple-wearing babies from the total number of babies to find the number of blue-wearing babies: 8 babies - 6 babies = <<8-6=2>>2 babies\nNow divide the number of purple bow babies by the total number of bow babies to find the percentage chance a bow baby wears purple: 2 babies / (2 babies + 2 babies) = 2 babies / 4 babies = .5 * 100% = 50%\n#### 50"
