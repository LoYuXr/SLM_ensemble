    "question": "Tommy is fundraising for his charity by selling brownies for $3 a slice and cheesecakes for $4 a slice. If Tommy sells 43 brownies and 23 slices of cheesecake, how much money does Tommy raise?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total revenue from the brownies and the total revenue from the cheesecakes separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the revenue from the brownies:\n- Tommy sells 43 slices of brownies at $3 per slice.\n- The total revenue from brownies is \\( 43 \\times 3 = 129 \\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue from the cheesecakes:\n- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 per slice.\n- The total revenue from cheesecakes is \\( 23 \\times 4 = 92 \\) dollars.\n\nNow, we add the revenue from the brownies and the revenue from the cheesecakes to find the total amount of money Tommy raises:\n- The total revenue is \\( 129 + 92 = 221 \\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Tommy raises is \\(\\boxed{221}\\).",
    "answer": "Tommy raised 43 brownies x $3/brownie = $<<43*3=129>>129 by selling brownies.\nTommy raised 23 slices x $4 = $<<23*4=92>>92 by selling cheesecakes.\nIn total Tommy has raised $129 + $92 = $<<129+92=221>>221\n#### 221"
