    "question": "Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year.  She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.  Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine.  How many magazines does she get every year?",
    "completion": "To determine how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of magazines she receives from both her current magazines and her last magazine.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of magazines from her current magazines:\n- Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year.\n- Each of these magazines sends 6 issues a year.\n- Therefore, the total number of magazines from her current magazines is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\text{ magazines} \\times 12 \\text{ issues/magazine} = 36 \\text{ magazines}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of magazines from her last magazine:\n- Susan has 1 magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine.\n- The 6 issue magazine sends 6 issues, so the 1 issue magazine sends:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 6 = 24 \\text{ issues}\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the total number of magazines from her last magazine is:\n  \\[\n  1 \\text{ magazine} \\times 24 \\text{ issues/magazine} = 24 \\text{ magazines}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of magazines from her current magazines and her last magazine to find the total number of magazines she receives every year:\n\\[\n36 \\text{ magazines} + 24 \\text{ magazines} = 60 \\text{ magazines}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{60}\n\\]",
    "answer": "She has 3 magazines that send 12 issues so that\u2019s 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 issues\nHer last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine so that\u2019s 4*6 = <<4*6=24>>24 issues\nAll total she receives 36+24+6 = <<36+24+6=66>>66 magazine issues a year\n#### 66"
