    "question": "Three of the women at the cocktail party are wearing 4 inch heels and three are wearing 2 inch heels. What is the average height of heels at this party?",
    "completion": "To find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of heels:**\n   - There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels.\n   - There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels.\n   - Therefore, the total number of heels is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ (4-inch heels)} + 3 \\text{ (2-inch heels)} = 6 \\text{ heels}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the average height:**\n   - The average height is the total number of heels divided by the total number of women.\n   - Total number of heels = 6\n   - Total number of women = 3 + 3 = 6\n   - Average height = \\(\\frac{6 \\text{ heels}}{6 \\text{ women}} = 1 \\text{ heel}\\)\n\nThus, the average height of the heels at the party is \\(\\boxed{1}\\) inch.",
    "answer": "First find the total number of inches from the 4-inch heels: 3 women * 4 inches/woman = <<3*4=12>>12 inches\nThen find the total number of inches from the 2-inch heels: 3 women * 2 inches/woman = <<3*2=6>>6 inches\nThen add the total number of inches from each group of heels to find the overall total: 12 inches + 6 inches = <<12+6=18>>18 inches\nThen find the total number of women at the party: 3 women + 3 women = <<3+3=6>>6 women\nThen divide the total number of heel inches by the number of women to find the average heel height per woman: 18 inches / 6 women = <<18/6=3>>3 inches / woman\n#### 3"
