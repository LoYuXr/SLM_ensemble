    "question": "A juggler can juggle 16 balls.  Half of the balls are golf balls, and half of the golf balls are blue.  How many blue golf balls are there?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of blue golf balls, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of balls the juggler can juggle.\n2. Determine the fraction of the balls that are golf balls.\n3. Calculate the number of golf balls.\n4. Determine the fraction of the golf balls that are blue.\n5. Calculate the number of blue golf balls.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The total number of balls the juggler can juggle is 16.\n2. Half of the balls are golf balls. Therefore, the number of golf balls is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{16}{2} = 8\n   \\]\n3. Half of the golf balls are blue. Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n   \\]\n\nSo, the number of blue golf balls is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
    "answer": "Golf Balls:16/2=<<16/2=8>>8\nBlue Golf Balls:8/2=<<8/2=4>>4 balls\n#### 4"
