    "question": "A company's HR hires 20 new employees every month to add to its total workforce. If the company's initial employee number is 200, and each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months?",
    "completion": "To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of employees hired each month.\n2. Calculate the total number of employees hired over three months.\n3. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees over three months.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the number of employees hired each month.**\n\nThe company hires 20 new employees every month. The initial employee number is 200. Therefore, the number of employees hired each month is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ employees/month} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of employees hired over three months.**\n\nSince the company hires 20 new employees each month, over three months, the total number of employees hired is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ employees/month} \\times 3 \\text{ months} = 60 \\text{ employees} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees over three months.**\n\nEach employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to all employees over three months is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ employees} \\times 4000 \\text{ dollars/employee} = 240,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:\n\\[ \\boxed{240000} \\]",
    "answer": "If each month the company hire 20 new employees, the total number of employees in the company in the first month is 200 employees + 20 employees = <<200+20=220>>220 employees\nIf each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount of money paid by the employee to its workers in the first month is 220 employees * $4000/employee = $<<220*4000=880000>>880000\nIn the second month, 20 more workers are hired, bringing the total number of employees to 220 employees + 20 employees = 240 employees\nThe company pays a total of 240 employees * $4000/employee = $<<240*4000=960000>>960000 in wages for its employees in the second month.\nWhen an additional 20 workers are hired in the third month, the total number of workers become 240 employees + 20 employees = <<240+20=260>>260 employees\nIn total, the company 260 employees * $4000/employee = $<<260*4000=1040000>>1040000 in wages on the third month.\nThe total amount of money the company pays to all its employees in the three months is $1040000 + $960000 + $880000 = <<1040000+960000+880000=2880000>>2880000\n#### 2880000"
