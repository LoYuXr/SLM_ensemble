    "question": "Mark works at his job for 8 hours a day for 5 days a week.  He used to make $10 an hour but they raised his pay by $2 per hour.  How much does he make a week?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Mark makes a week after the pay increase, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Mark's hourly wage before the pay increase.\n2. Determine the new hourly wage after the pay increase.\n3. Calculate the total earnings for the week.\n\nFirst, let's find Mark's hourly wage before the pay increase. He worked 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so his total work hours per week are:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 40 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\nHis hourly wage before the pay increase is:\n\\[ \\frac{40 \\text{ hours/week}}{5 \\text{ days/week}} = 8 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the new hourly wage after the pay increase. The pay increase is $2 per hour, so the new hourly wage is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ dollars/hour} + 2 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 10 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total earnings for the week. Since he works 40 hours a week at the new hourly wage of $10 per hour, his total earnings are:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 400 \\text{ dollars/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, Mark makes \\(\\boxed{400}\\) dollars a week after the pay increase.",
    "answer": "He works 8*5=<<8*5=40>>40 hours a week\nHe gets paid 10+2=$<<10+2=12>>12 an hour\nSo he now gets 40*12=$<<40*12=480>>480 per week\n#### 480"
