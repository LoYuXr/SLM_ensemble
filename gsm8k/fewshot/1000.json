    "question": "Doctor Jones is scheduling his time for Monday. He is spending nine hours at the clinic where he works that day. He has to do rounds to check on inpatients staying at the clinic, which takes twenty minutes per inpatient, and he has ten appointments, which take thirty minutes each. How many hours will Doctor Jones have left to update his records if he has 9 inpatients at the clinic?",
    "completion": "To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends at the clinic and then subtract that from the total available time.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends at the clinic:\n- He has 9 inpatients at the clinic.\n- Each inpatient takes 20 minutes to check on.\n- Therefore, the total time spent on inpatients is \\(9 \\times 20 = 180\\) minutes.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on appointments:\n- He has 10 appointments.\n- Each appointment takes 30 minutes.\n- Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is \\(10 \\times 30 = 300\\) minutes.\n\nNow, let's find the total time Doctor Jones spends at the clinic and on appointments:\n- The total time spent is \\(180 + 300 = 480\\) minutes.\n\nSince Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients at the clinic, he will spend \\(9 \\times 20 = 180\\) minutes on inpatients. Therefore, the total time spent at the clinic and on appointments is \\(180 + 180 = 360\\) minutes.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total time spent from the total available time to find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left:\n- The total available time is 9 hours.\n- The time spent is 360 minutes.\n- Therefore, the time left is \\(9 - 360 = -351\\) hours.\n\nSince the time spent is negative, it means Doctor Jones has already spent more than 9 hours at the clinic. Therefore, he will have no time left to update his records.\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{0}\\) hours.",
    "answer": "Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients, so his rounds will take 9 * 20 = <<9*20=180>>180 minutes.\nHe has ten appointments, which will take 10 * 30 = <<10*30=300>>300 minutes.\nThe rounds and appointments will take 180 + 300 = <<180+300=480>>480 minutes total.\nAn hour is 60 minutes, so rounds and appointments will take 480 / 60 = <<480/60=8>>8 hours.\nDoctor Jones will have 9 - 8 = <<9-8=1>>1 hour left to update his records.\n#### 1"
