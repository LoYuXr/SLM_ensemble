    "question": "If a classroom has 3 times as many girls as they do boys, and 1/10 as many nongendered children as they do boys, and the classroom has 30 boys.  How many total children does it have?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of children in the classroom, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of boys:**\n   The classroom has 30 boys.\n\n2. **Determine the number of girls:**\n   According to the problem, the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys. Therefore, the number of girls is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of boys} = 3 \\times 30 = 90\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of nongendered children:**\n   The problem states that the classroom has \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) as many nongendered children as boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of nongendered children} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\text{Number of boys} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times 30 = 3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of children:**\n   To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of children} = \\text{Number of boys} + \\text{Number of girls} + \\text{Number of nongendered children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of children in the classroom is \\(\\boxed{123}\\).",
    "answer": "The classroom has 3 * 30 boys = <<3*30=90>>90 girls.\nThe classroom has 1/10 nongendered children so 10/100 * 30 boys = <<10/100*30=3>>3 nongendered children.\nIn total the classroom has 90 + 30 + 3 = <<90+30+3=123>>123 students.\n#### 123"
