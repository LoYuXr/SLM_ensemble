    "question": "There are 50 books in a small library. Half of them are written in English, and 10% in German. All others are written in Spanish. How many Spanish books are there?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of English books.\n2. Calculate the number of German books.\n3. Subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books.\n\nFirst, we know that half of the 50 books are written in English. So, the number of English books is:\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{2} = 25\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that 10% of the books are written in German. So, the number of German books is:\n\\[\n0.10 \\times 50 = 5\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the number of Spanish books by subtracting the number of English and German books from the total number of books:\n\\[\n50 - 25 - 5 = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of Spanish books is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Half of the books are in English, which means 50 * 0.5 = <<50*0.5=25>>25 books.\nGerman books make up to 10%, which means there are 10/100 * 50 = <<10/100*50=5>>5 of them.\nSo as a result there are 50 - 25 - 5 = <<50-25-5=20>>20 Spanish books in the library.\n#### 20"
