    "question": "Brett is 14 years old. In four years his sister Angela will be three times as old as he is now. How old is Angela right now?",
    "completion": "To determine Angela's current age, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.\n\nLet \\( A \\) be Angela's current age.\n\nAccording to the problem, in four years, Angela's age will be three times Brett's current age. Brett is currently 14 years old. Therefore, in four years, Brett's age will be:\n\\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \\]\n\nAt that time, Angela's age will be:\n\\[ A + 4 \\]\n\nThe problem states that in four years, Angela's age will be three times Brett's current age. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ A + 4 = 3 \\times 18 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 3 \\times 18 \\):\n\\[ 3 \\times 18 = 54 \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[ A + 4 = 54 \\]\n\nTo find Angela's current age, we solve for \\( A \\) by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ A = 54 - 4 \\]\n\\[ A = 50 \\]\n\nThus, Angela is currently \\(\\boxed{50}\\) years old.",
    "answer": "Four years from now Angela will be 14*3=<<14*3=42>>42.\nRight now Angela is 42-4=<<42-4=38>>38 years old.\n#### 38"
