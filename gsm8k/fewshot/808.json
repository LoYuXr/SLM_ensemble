    "question": "There are 10 quarts of tea left from the party. Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea and 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea. How many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party?",
    "completion": "To determine how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of tea drunk by the students.\n2. Add this amount to the 10 quarts of tea left at the beginning of the party.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of tea drunk by the students. Each of the four students drank 1.5 quarts of tea, and each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea drunk by the students is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 1.5 + 16 \\times 2 = 6 + 32 = 38 \\text{ quarts} \\]\n\nNext, we add this amount to the 10 quarts of tea left at the beginning of the party:\n\\[ 10 + 38 = 48 \\text{ quarts} \\]\n\nSince there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert 48 quarts to gallons by dividing by 4:\n\\[ 48 \\div 4 = 12 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]",
    "answer": "4 students drank 1.5 quarts = 4 * 1.5 = <<4*1.5=6>>6 quarts\n16 students drank 2 quarts = 16 * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 quarts\nStudents drank 6 + 32 quarts = <<6+32=38>>38 quarts\nStudents + tea left = 38 + 10 quarts = <<38+10=48>>48 quarts\n48 quarts = 12 gallons\nThe party started with 12 gallons of tea.\n#### 12"
