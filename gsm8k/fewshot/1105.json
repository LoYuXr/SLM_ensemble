    "question": "Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck. How many more years does Lauren need to work if she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, live with 40% of her current annual salary, and her current salary is $100,000?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we need to calculate her annual savings and then determine how many years it will take for her to accumulate $200,000 (since 20% of her current salary is $200,000).\n\nFirst, let's calculate Lauren's annual savings. Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary. Her current annual salary is $100,000, so her annual savings are:\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 100,000 = 20,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many years it will take for Lauren to accumulate $200,000. Since she saves $20,000 per year, the number of years required is:\n\\[ \\frac{200,000}{20,000} = 10 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nTherefore, Lauren needs to work for \\(\\boxed{10}\\) more years to save for a retirement period of 20 years, live with 40% of her current annual salary, and her current salary is $100,000.",
    "answer": "Lauren plans to live in retirement with 40% of her current salary ($100,000), therefore 40%*$100,000 = $<<40*.01*100000=40000>>40,000\nIf she wants to save for 20 years, then she will need to save 20 * $40,000 = $<<20*40000=800000>>800,000 to retire\nIf her current salary is $100,00 and she's saving 20%, then she's able to save $100,000 * 20% = $<<100000*20*.01=20000>>20,000 every year\nTo reach her desired savings goal ($800,000) she will need to work for another $800,000/$20,000 = <<800000/20000=40>>40 years\n#### 40"
