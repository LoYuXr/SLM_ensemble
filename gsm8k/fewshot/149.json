    "question": "Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, how many Facebook friends does James have?",
    "completion": "To determine how many Facebook friends James has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of friends Dorothy has.\n2. Use the information about Charlie's friends to find out how many friends Dorothy has.\n3. Use the information about James's friends to find out how many friends James has.\n\nLet's start with the information given:\n- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.\n- Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy.\n- James has four times as many friends as Dorothy.\n\nFirst, we can find out how many friends Dorothy has by dividing the number of friends Charlie has by 3:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of friends Dorothy has} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the information about James's friends to find out how many friends James has. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we multiply the number of friends Dorothy has by 4:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of friends James has} = 4 \\times 4 = 16\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of Facebook friends James has is \\boxed{16}.",
    "answer": "Dorothy has 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 Facebook friends.\nJames has 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 Facebook friends.\n#### 16"
