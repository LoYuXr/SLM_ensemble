    "question": "Hannah has a mental breakdown while studying for finals and starts smashing windows in the high school's parking lot. She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows and 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows. If there are 64 students' cars with four windows each and 32 teachers' cars with two windows each, how many windows does Hannah smash?",
    "completion": "To determine how many windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows she smashes for both students' and teachers' cars separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes for the students' cars:\n- There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each.\n- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.\n- The number of windows Hannah smashes for the students' cars is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{4} \\times 64 \\times 4 = 16 \\times 4 = 64\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes for the teachers' cars:\n- There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each.\n- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.\n- The number of windows Hannah smashes for the teachers' cars is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3}{4} \\times 32 \\times 2 = 24 \\times 2 = 48\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of windows Hannah smashes for both students' and teachers' cars:\n\\[\n64 + 48 = 112\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is \\boxed{112}.",
    "answer": "First find how many student cars Hannah smashed: 64 cars * 1/4 = <<64*1/4=16>>16 cars\nThen find how many teacher cars Hannah smashed: 32 cars * 3/4 = <<32*3/4=24>>24 cars\nThen find how many windows the students' cars had smashed: 16 cars * 4 windows/car = <<16*4=64>>64 windows\nThen find how many windows the teachers' cars had smashed: 24 cars * 2 windows/car = <<24*2=48>>48 windows\nThen add the number of students' and teachers' windows smashed to find the total number of windows smashed: 64 windows + 48 windows = <<64+48=112>>112 windows\n#### 112"
