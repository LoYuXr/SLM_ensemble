    "question": "There are 9 Fast and the Furious movies, Deepa has seen each one in the theatre three times. She has spent $216 seeing these movies. What is the average price she paid per ticket?",
    "completion": "To find the average price per ticket that Deepa paid for the Fast and the Furious movies, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the total number of tickets Deepa saw.\n2. Calculate the total cost of all the tickets.\n3. Divide the total cost by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.\n\nFirst, we know that Deepa has seen each Fast and the Furious movie three times. Therefore, the total number of tickets she saw is:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ movies} \\times 3 \\text{ times/movie} = 27 \\text{ tickets} \\]\n\nNext, we know that the total amount she spent is $216. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount by the total number of tickets:\n\\[ \\frac{216 \\text{ dollars}}{27 \\text{ tickets}} = 8 \\text{ dollars/ticket} \\]\n\nSo, the average price she paid per ticket is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",
    "answer": "She has seen 27 movies because 9 x 3 = <<9*3=27>>27\nThey cost $8 each because 216 / 27 = <<216/27=8>>8\n#### 8"
