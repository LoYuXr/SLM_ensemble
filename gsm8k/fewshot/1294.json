Then, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40. What is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts:\n- Jake buys 2 T-shirts.\n- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.\n- The buy one get one 50% off deal means that for every two T-shirts, Jake only pays for one.\n\nThe cost of the T-shirts is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 8 \\times 0.5 = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:\n- The original price of the shoes is $40.\n- Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price.\n\nThe discount on the shoes is:\n\\[ 40\\% \\times 40 = 0.40 \\times 40 = 16 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe cost of the shoes after the discount is:\n\\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we sum the costs of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:\n\\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{32}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The cost of a T-shirt after 50% is taken off of the original price is $8 * 0.50 = $<<8*0.50=4>>4\nThe total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $<<8+4=12>>12\nThe amount of money taken off from the original price of the shoes is $40 * 0.40 = $<<40*0.4=16>>16\nThe cost of the shoes after the sale is $40 - $16 = $<<40-16=24>>24\nThe total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $12 + $24 = $<<12+24=36>>36\n#### 36"
