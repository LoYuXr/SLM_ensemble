    "question": "The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If the 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters, what was the length of the red rope in centimeters?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \\( B \\) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \\( 4B \\) centimeters. The problem also states that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \\( B + 7 \\) centimeters.\n\nThe combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\nB + 4B + (B + 7) = 37\n\\]\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[\nB + 4B + B + 7 = 37\n\\]\n\\[\n6B + 7 = 37\n\\]\nNext, we isolate \\( B \\) by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n6B = 30\n\\]\nThen, we solve for \\( B \\) by dividing both sides by 6:\n\\[\nB = 5\n\\]\nNow that we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters, we can find the length of the red rope, which is \\( 4B \\):\n\\[\n4B = 4 \\times 5 = 20\n\\]\nTherefore, the length of the red rope is \\(\\boxed{20}\\) centimeters.",
    "answer": "Let Y = the length of the yellow rope in centimeters\nBlue rope = Y - 7\nRed rope = 4 * (Y - 7)\nY + Y - 7 + 4 (Y - 7) = 37 cm\n6Y - 35 = 37\n6Y = 72\nY = <<12=12>>12 cm\nThe red rope was 20 cm long.\n#### 20"
