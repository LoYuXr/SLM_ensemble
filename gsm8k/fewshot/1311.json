    "question": "The caretaker of the docks needs to buy some new line. He wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Right now, there is 200 feet of dock, and he has 6 feet of new line. How many feet of line does he need to buy in total?",
    "completion": "To determine how many feet of new line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the current amount of new line available:**\n   The caretaker currently has 6 feet of new line.\n\n2. **Determine the amount of new line needed per foot of dock:**\n   The caretaker wants 3 feet of new line for every foot of dock.\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of new line needed for the dock:**\n   Since the caretaker needs 3 feet of new line for every foot of dock, we multiply the amount of new line available by the number of feet of dock:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ feet of new line} \\times 3 \\text{ feet per foot of dock} = 18 \\text{ feet of new line}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Add the amount of new line needed for the dock to the amount of new line already available:**\n   The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, so we add this to the 18 feet of new line needed for the dock:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ feet of new line} + 18 \\text{ feet of new line} = 24 \\text{ feet of new line}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the caretaker needs to buy a total of \\boxed{24} feet of new line.",
    "answer": "200*3 = <<200*3=600>>600 feet of line.\nThe caretaker needs to buy 600-6 = <<600-6=594>>594 feet of line.\n#### 594"
