    "question": "Jackson is planting tulips. He can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. If Jackson buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips, how many rows of flowers will he plant?",
    "completion": "To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:\n- Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in each row.\n- He buys 36 red tulips.\n- The number of rows for the red tulips is given by the total number of red tulips divided by the number of tulips per row:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of rows for red tulips} = \\frac{36}{6} = 6\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:\n- Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in each row.\n- He buys 24 blue tulips.\n- The number of rows for the blue tulips is given by the total number of blue tulips divided by the number of tulips per row:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of rows for blue tulips} = \\frac{24}{8} = 3\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of rows for the red and blue tulips to find the total number of rows:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of rows} = 6 + 3 = 9\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant is \\boxed{9}.",
    "answer": "First, divide the number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row: 36 / 6 = <<36/6=6>>6 rows.\nNext, divide the number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips per row: 24 / 8 = <<24/8=3>>3 rows.\nNow add the number of rows of each color to find the total: 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 rows.\n#### 9"
