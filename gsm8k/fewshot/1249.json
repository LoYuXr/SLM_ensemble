    "question": "The power goes out in Brianna's house one night so she and her family gather all their candles and flashlights. There are 8 rooms in the house and 4 people living there, including Brianna. There is a flashlight for every person to carry and two for each room. They have a variety of candles available; 4 small candles each for half the rooms and 5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms. With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of candles and flashlights used by Brianna's family, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of people:**\n   There are 8 rooms in the house, and each room has 4 people.\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ rooms} \\times 4 \\text{ people/room} = 32 \\text{ people}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of candles:**\n   Each person has a flashlight, and there are 32 people.\n   \\[\n   32 \\text{ people} \\times 1 \\text{ flashlight/person} = 32 \\text{ flashlights}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of medium candles:**\n   Each person has 2 medium candles, and there are 32 people.\n   \\[\n   32 \\text{ people} \\times 2 \\text{ medium candles/person} = 64 \\text{ medium candles}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of small candles:**\n   Each person has 4 small candles, and there are 32 people.\n   \\[\n   32 \\text{ people} \\times 4 \\text{ small candles/person} = 128 \\text{ small candles}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of flashlights and medium candles:**\n   Add the total number of flashlights and medium candles together.\n   \\[\n   32 \\text{ flashlights} + 64 \\text{ medium candles} = 96 \\text{ total items}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of candles and flashlights used by Brianna's family is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
    "answer": "For every one of the 8 rooms in the house, there are 2 flashlights, 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 flashlights.\nFor every person there is 1 flashlight, 1 x 4 people = <<1*4=4>>4 flashlights.\nTotal, there are 16 + 4 = <<16+4=20>>20 flashlights in the house being used by Brianna and her family.\nFor half of the 8 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, 8/2 x 4 = <<8/2*4=16>>16 small candles in half the rooms.\nFor the other half of the 8 rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, 8/2 x 5 = <<8/2*5=20>>20 medium candles in all the rooms.\nTotal, there are 16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36 candles in the house.\nCombined, there are 20 flashlights + 36 candles = <<20+36=56>>56 flashlights and candles in the house.\n#### 56"
