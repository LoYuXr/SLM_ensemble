    "question": "Jackie grew 3\" over the summer.  She is now 2\" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert.  If Albert is 36\" tall, how tall was Jackie before summer?",
    "completion": "To determine Jackie's height before summer, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Albert's height:**\n   Albert is given as 36 inches tall.\n\n2. **Calculate Albert's height in terms of Jackie's height:**\n   Since Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Albert, we subtract 2 inches from Albert's height:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Albert's height in terms of Jackie's height} = 36 - 2 = 34 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine Albert's height in terms of Jackie's height:**\n   Albert is twice the size of Jackie. Therefore, we divide Albert's height in terms of Jackie's height by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Jackie's height in terms of Albert's height} = \\frac{34}{2} = 17 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Jackie's height before summer:**\n   Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer. Therefore, we add 3 inches to her height in terms of Albert's height:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Jackie's height before summer} = 17 + 3 = 20 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Jackie's height before summer was \\boxed{20} inches.",
    "answer": "Anne is twice the size of Albert, who is 36\", so Anne is 2*36 = <<72=72>>72\" tall\nAnne is 72\" tall and Jackie is 2\" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72-2 = <<72-2=70>>70\" tall\nJackie is currently 70\" tall and grew 3\" over summer, so before summer she was 70-3= <<70-3=67>>67\" tall\n#### 67"
