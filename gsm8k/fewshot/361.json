    "question": "A train travels between 3 different cities.  It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city.  It does this trip 3 times a day.  The train needs service every 18,000 miles so how many days does it go between services?",
    "completion": "To determine how many days the train goes between services, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance traveled by the train in one trip.\n2. Determine how many trips the train makes in one day.\n3. Calculate how many days the train goes between services.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled in one trip.**\n\nThe train travels:\n- 75 miles from the first city to the second city\n- 100 miles from the second city to the third city\n- 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city\n\nFirst, calculate the combined distance for the third city to the first city:\n\\[ 75 + 100 = 175 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nThen, calculate the distance for the second city to the third city:\n\\[ 175 - 50 = 125 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNow, add these distances together to find the total distance for one trip:\n\\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 200 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many trips the train makes in one day.**\n\nThe train makes 3 trips a day.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many days the train goes between services.**\n\nThe train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days the train goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled by the service interval by the distance for one trip:\n\\[ \\frac{200 \\text{ miles}}{18,000 \\text{ miles}} = \\frac{200}{18,000} = \\frac{1}{90} \\text{ days} \\]\n\nSince the train cannot go a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{90} \\approx 0.0111 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nRounding up, the train goes between services for:\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\text{ day} \\]",
    "answer": "It takes 100+75=<<100+75=175>>175 miles for the first two legs of the trip\nThe third leg is 175-50=<<175-50=125>>125 miles\nSo the total trip is 175+125=<<175+125=300>>300 miles\nSo it goes 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 miles per day\nSo it can go 18000/900=<<18000/900=20>>20 days between services.\n#### 20"
