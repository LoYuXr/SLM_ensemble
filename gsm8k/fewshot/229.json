    "question": "A watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?",
    "completion": "To determine how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we need to follow the steps of the problem carefully.\n\n1. **Initial Production and Harvest:**\n   - The farm produced 120 baby watermelons.\n   - 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest.\n   - Therefore, the number of ready watermelons is \\( 120 \\times 0.30 = 36 \\).\n   - The number of remaining watermelons is \\( 120 - 36 = 84 \\).\n\n2. **Harvesting and Harvesting:**\n   - Ashlyn took the remaining 84 watermelons home.\n   - After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready.\n   - The number of ready watermelons after two weeks is \\( 84 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 63 \\).\n   - The number of remaining watermelons is \\( 84 - 63 = 21 \\).\n\nSo, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
    "answer": "When Ashlyn found out that 30% of the melons were ready, she took home 30/100 *120 = <<30/100*120=36>>36 watermelons.\nThe number of watermelons remaining on the farm is 120-36 =<<120-36=84>>84\nWhen she returned two weeks later, she found that 3/4*84 = <<3/4*84=63>>63 were ready for harvest,\nThe number of watermelons that were not ready is 84-63 =<<84-63=21>>21\n#### 21"
