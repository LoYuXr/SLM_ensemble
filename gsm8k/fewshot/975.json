    "question": "Richard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 60 cherries. If Robert has 30 cherries, and has 10 more than Richard, how many more cherries does Robert have than Jerry?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of cherries Richard has.\n2. Use the information about Robert's cherries to find out how many cherries Jerry has.\n3. Calculate the difference between the number of cherries Robert has and the number of cherries Jerry has.\n\nFirst, we know that Robert has 30 cherries. According to the problem, Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, we can find out how many cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from the number of cherries Robert has:\n\\[ \\text{Number of cherries Richard has} = 30 - 10 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Richard has 20 cherries. Now, we need to find out how many cherries Jerry has. The total number of cherries is 60, and we already know that Robert has 30 cherries. Therefore, the number of cherries Jerry has is:\n\\[ \\text{Number of cherries Jerry has} = 60 - 30 = 30 \\]\n\nFinally, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. We do this by subtracting the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 30 - 20 = 10 \\]\n\nSo, Robert has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) more cherries than Jerry.",
    "answer": "Since Robert has 30, then 60 - 30 = <<30=30>>30 cherries are left to be shared by Richard and Jerry.\nRichard has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 cherries since Robert has 10 more cherries than him.\nJerry has 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 cherries.\nSo Robert has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 more cherries than Jerry.\n#### 20"
