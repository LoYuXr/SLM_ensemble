    "question": "Shawnda decides that her neighborhood kids could really use a bike inflation service. She decides the best way to charge is by the tire. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Finally, one person actually came by on a unicycle. How many dollars did she make that day?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Shawnda made that day from the bike inflation service, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating the tires and then subtract the cost of the unicycle.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tires for the people who came by to get both tires inflated:\n- 5 people each get one tire, so that's \\(5 \\times 25 = 125\\) cents.\n- 3 people each get two tires, so that's \\(3 \\times 25 \\times 2 = 150\\) cents.\n- 1 person gets one tire, so that's \\(1 \\times 25 = 25\\) cents.\n\nAdding these amounts together, the total cost for the tires is:\n\\[125 + 150 + 25 = 300 \\text{ cents}\\]\n\nNext, we need to subtract the cost of the unicycle:\n\\[300 - 25 = 275 \\text{ cents}\\]\n\nSince there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the remaining amount to dollars:\n\\[275 \\text{ cents} = 2.75 \\text{ dollars}\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Shawnda made that day is:\n\\[\\boxed{2.75}\\]",
    "answer": "There were 10 bike tires to fill up because 2 times 5 equals <<2*5=10>>10.\nThere were 9 tricycle tires to fill up because 3 times 3 equals <<3*3=9>>9.\nThere was one unicycle tire to fill up because 1 times 1 equals 1.\nThere were 20 total tires to fill up because 10 plus 9 plus 1 equals <<10+9+1=20>>20.\nShe made $5 because 20 times .25 equals <<20*.25=5>>5.\n#### 5"
