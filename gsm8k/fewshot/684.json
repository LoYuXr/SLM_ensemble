    "question": "John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school together. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is. It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. How much longer do they have to get to school without being late?",
    "completion": "To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time they have already spent walking and then subtract that from the total time available.\n\nFirst, let's find the total time they have spent walking:\n- It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.\n- It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station.\n- Therefore, the total time spent walking is \\(6 + 13 = 19\\) minutes.\n\nNext, we know that they have 30 minutes available to walk to school. To find out how much longer they have to walk, we subtract the time they have already spent walking from the total time available:\n\\[30 - 19 = 11\\]\n\nSo, John and Jack have to get to school \\(\\boxed{11}\\) more minutes without being late.",
    "answer": "John and Jack arrive at the library with 30 - 6 = <<30-6=24>>24 minutes left to reach the fire station.\nThey then arrive at the fire station and have 24 - 13 = <<24-13=11>>11 minutes left to get to school without being late.\n#### 11"
