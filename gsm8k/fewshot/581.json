    "question": "Max plans to watch two movies this weekend. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long while the second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. How many minutes will it take Max to watch the two movies?",
    "completion": "To determine the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the durations of the two movies together. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, and the second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.\n\nFirst, let's convert the time for each movie into minutes:\n- 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.\n- 30 minutes is already in minutes.\n\nSo, the first movie is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ minutes} + 30 \\text{ minutes} = 90 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThe second movie is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} + 5 \\text{ minutes} = 120 \\text{ minutes} + 5 \\text{ minutes} = 125 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we add the two times together:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ minutes} + 125 \\text{ minutes} = 215 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is:\n\\[ \\boxed{215} \\]",
    "answer": "One hour has 60 minutes.\nThe first movie is 60 + 30 = <<60+30=90>>90 minutes long.\nTwo hours is equal to 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.\nThe second movie is 120 + 5 = <<120+5=125>>125 minutes long.\nMax will take 90 + 125 = <<90+125=215>>215 minutes to watch the two movies.\n#### 215"
