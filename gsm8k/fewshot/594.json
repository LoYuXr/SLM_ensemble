    "question": "A cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein.  If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day how many grams of protein does he get per week?",
    "completion": "To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total grams of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms:**\n   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.\n   - Each mushroom has 3 grams of protein.\n   - Therefore, the total grams of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms is:\n     \\[\n     200 \\text{ grams} \\times 3 \\text{ grams of protein per mushroom} = 600 \\text{ grams of protein}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the daily protein intake:**\n   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.\n   - Therefore, his daily protein intake is:\n     \\[\n     200 \\text{ grams}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the weekly protein intake:**\n   - There are 7 days in a week.\n   - Therefore, his weekly protein intake is:\n     \\[\n     200 \\text{ grams/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 1400 \\text{ grams of protein}\n     \\]\n\nThus, John gets \\(\\boxed{1400}\\) grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms.",
    "answer": "He eats 200/100=<<200/100=2>>2 cups per day\nSo that means he gets 2*3=<<6=6>>6 grams of protein per day\nSo he gets 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 grams of protein per week\n#### 42"
