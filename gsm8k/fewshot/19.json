    "question": "Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to walk the remaining distance?",
    "completion": "To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has spent hiking so far and then use that information to find the required speed.\n\n1. **Calculate the total time spent hiking so far:**\n   - The first 4 miles took 1 hour.\n   - The next 2 miles took 1 hour.\n   - Therefore, the total time spent hiking so far is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) hours.\n\n2. **Determine the remaining distance:**\n   - The total distance of the trail is 12 miles.\n   - The distance already hiked is 4 miles.\n   - Therefore, the remaining distance is \\(12 - 4 = 8\\) miles.\n\n3. **Calculate the required speed to hike the remaining 8 miles in 2 hours:**\n   - The required speed is the total distance divided by the total time.\n   - Required speed = \\(\\frac{8 \\text{ miles}}{2 \\text{ hours}} = 4 \\text{ miles per hour}\\).\n\nThus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at an average speed of \\(\\boxed{4}\\) miles per hour.",
    "answer": "First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours\nNext subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour\nNow figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles\nNow divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph\n#### 6"
