    "question": "Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time and 3 other people each bid once. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost of the antique desk that Carmen won, we need to calculate the total amount of money she won from the bids. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with an opening bid of $200.\n2. **Bid Rises by $50 Each Time**: Each subsequent bid increases by $50.\n3. **Number of Bids**: Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids 3 times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Carmen won from the bids:\n- The first bid is $200.\n- The second bid is $200 + $50 = $250.\n- The third bid is $250 + $50 = $300.\n\nNow, we sum these amounts to find the total amount of money Carmen won:\n\\[\n200 + 250 + 300 = 750\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the antique desk that Carmen won is \\(\\boxed{750}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.\nCarmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.\nSo in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.\nThe desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.\n#### 500"
