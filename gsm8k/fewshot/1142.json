    "question": "Jess is trying to guess the number of blue jellybeans in a jar. She can see that there are 17 green jelly beans and twice as many red jelly beans. The rest of the jellybeans are blue jelly beans. If there are a total of 60 jelly beans in total, how many blue jellybeans are there?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of blue jellybeans in the jar, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of green jellybeans.\n2. Calculate the number of red jellybeans.\n3. Subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 17 green jellybeans. The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans. Therefore, the number of red jellybeans is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 17 = 34 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans:\n\\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \\]\n\nThe total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:\n\\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \\]\n\nThus, the number of blue jellybeans is:\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]",
    "answer": "There are 17 green jelly beans * 2 = <<17*2=34>>34 red jelly beans.\nSo in the green and red jelly beans, there are a total of 17 + 34 = <<17+34=51>>51 jellybeans.\nAs the rest are blue, there must be 60 total jellybeans \u2013 51 red and green jelly beans = <<60-51=9>>9 blue jelly beans.\n#### 9"
