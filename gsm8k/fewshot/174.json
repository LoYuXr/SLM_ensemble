    "question": "Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time required for both peeling and cutting the potatoes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes to peel the potatoes:\n- Billy needs to peel 60 potatoes.\n- It takes him about 1.5 minutes to peel each potato.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time to peel} = 60 \\text{ potatoes} \\times 1.5 \\text{ minutes per potato} = 90 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes to cut the potatoes:\n- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut each potato.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time to cut} = 60 \\text{ potatoes} \\times 5 \\text{ seconds per potato} = 300 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the time to peel and the time to cut to find the total time required:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\text{Time to peel} + \\text{Time to cut} = 90 \\text{ minutes} + 300 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nTo convert 300 seconds into minutes and seconds:\n\n\\[\n300 \\text{ seconds} = 5 \\text{ minutes and } 30 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nAdding this to the time to peel:\n\n\\[\n90 \\text{ minutes} + 5 \\text{ minutes and } 30 \\text{ seconds} = 95 \\text{ minutes and } 30 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Billy \\boxed{95 \\text{ minutes and } 30 \\text{ seconds}} to finish prepping the potatoes.",
    "answer": "There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.\nBilly only takes 5 seconds to cut the potatoes, so it takes 5 seconds * 60 potatoes / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes to cut the potatoes.\nSo it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.\n#### 95"
