    "question": "James has to buy insurance.  Since he had an accident it was 60% more than normal.  The normal cost is $120 a month.  How much does he pay a year?",
    "completion": "To determine how much James pays in a year for his insurance, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the increased cost of insurance.\n2. Determine the annual cost based on the increased cost.\n\nFirst, let's find the increased cost of insurance. The normal cost is $120 a month. Since it was 60% more than normal, we need to calculate 60% of $120 and add it to the original $120.\n\n\\[ \\text{Increased cost} = 120 + (120 \\times 0.60) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Increased cost} = 120 + 72 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Increased cost} = 192 \\]\n\nSo, the increased cost of insurance is $192 a month.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much James pays in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12:\n\n\\[ \\text{Annual cost} = 192 \\times 12 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Annual cost} = 2304 \\]\n\nTherefore, James pays \\(\\boxed{2304}\\) dollars a year for his insurance.",
    "answer": "The insurance is 120*.6=$<<120*.6=72>>72 per month more expensive than normal\nSo he paid 120+72=$<<120+72=192>>192 a month\nThat means he pays 12*192=$<<12*192=2304>>2304\n#### 2304"
