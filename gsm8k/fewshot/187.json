    "question": "Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed to have monthly interest of 2%. If Mandy was able to pay it after 3 months, how much should she give to Benedict?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict, we need to calculate the total amount of interest Mandy will pay over the 3 months and then subtract this from the $100 she owes.\n\n1. **Calculate the total interest Mandy will pay over 3 months:**\n   - The monthly interest rate is 2%, so the interest for each month is \\( 100 \\times 0.02 = 2 \\) dollars.\n   - Over 3 months, the total interest is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount Mandy will pay over 3 months:**\n   - Mandy owes $100 in total.\n   - After paying the interest, she will owe \\( 100 - 6 = 94 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict:**\n   - Mandy owes $94 to Benedict.\n   - She has already paid $6, so she needs to give \\( 94 - 6 = 88 \\) dollars to Benedict.\n\nTherefore, Mandy should give Benedict \\(\\boxed{88}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "The monthly interest is $100 x 2/100 = $<<100*2/100=2>>2.\nAfter 3 months, the total interest amount to $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.\nTherefore, Mandy should give Benedict a total of $100 + $6 = $<<100+6=106>>106.\n#### 106"
