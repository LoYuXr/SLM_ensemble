    "question": "Paul is driving a car twice a day: in the morning, and in the afternoon. He did that for 14 days. Each morning ride cost him about $6, and each afternoon ride, about $2. How much money did he spend on driving his car during these two weeks?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate the total cost for each type of ride.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of rides Paul made in a day:\n- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.\n- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.\n- Therefore, the total number of rides per day is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ (morning rides)} + 2 \\text{ (afternoon rides)} = 4 \\text{ rides per day}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of rides over the 14 days:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ rides/day} \\times 14 \\text{ days} = 56 \\text{ rides}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost for the morning rides:\n- Each morning ride costs $6.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the morning rides is:\n  \\[\n  56 \\text{ rides} \\times 6 \\text{ dollars/ride} = 336 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides:\n- Each afternoon ride costs $2.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the afternoon rides is:\n  \\[\n  56 \\text{ rides} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/ride} = 112 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:\n\\[\n336 \\text{ dollars} + 112 \\text{ dollars} = 448 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{448}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Paul's morning rides cost him 14 * 6 = $<<14*6=84>>84.\nDriving in the afternoon, on the other hand, was a cost of 14 * 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28.\nSo in total Paul spend on driving 84 + 28 = $<<84+28=112>>112.\n#### 112"
