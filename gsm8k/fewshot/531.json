    "question": "48 people are riding a bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. On the second stop 21, passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on. How many passengers are riding the bus after the second stop?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of passengers on the bus:**\n   \\[\n   48\n   \\]\n\n2. **First stop:**\n   - 8 passengers get off.\n   - 5 times as many passengers get into the bus as those who got off.\n   - Number of passengers who get into the bus:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 8 = 40\n     \\]\n   - Total number of passengers after the first stop:\n     \\[\n     48 - 8 + 40 = 70\n     \\]\n\n3. **Second stop:**\n   - 21 passengers get off.\n   - 3 times fewer passengers get on than those who got off.\n   - Number of passengers who get on:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{21}{3} = 7\n     \\]\n   - Total number of passengers after the second stop:\n     \\[\n     70 - 21 + 7 = 56\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{56}\n\\]",
    "answer": "At the first stop, 5 * 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 passengers get on the bus.\nAfter the first stop the bus has ( 48 - 8 ) + 40 = <<48-8+40=80>>80 passengers.\nAt the second stop, 21 / 3 = <<21/3=7>>7 passengers get on the bus.\nAfter the second stop there are ( 80 - 21 ) + 7 = <<80-21+7=66>>66 passengers.\n#### 66"
