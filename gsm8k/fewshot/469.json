    "question": "Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles in her pantry. Each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes. Mary wants to bake enough cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles. If each pan holds 12 cupcakes, how many pans worth of cupcakes should she bake?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pans worth of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her jars of sprinkles.\n2. Determine how many pans are needed to hold all the decorated cupcakes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her jars of sprinkles. Since each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, the total number of cupcakes is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ jars} \\times 8 \\text{ cupcakes per jar} = 48 \\text{ cupcakes} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many pans are required to hold all 48 cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, the number of pans needed is:\n\\[ \\frac{48 \\text{ cupcakes}}{12 \\text{ cupcakes per pan}} = 4 \\text{ pans} \\]\n\nTherefore, Mary should bake \\(\\boxed{4}\\) pans worth of cupcakes.",
    "answer": "She has enough sprinkles for 6 * 8 = <<6*8=48>>48 cupcakes.\nShe needs 48 / 12 = <<48/12=4>>4 pans to bake all of the cupcakes.\n#### 4"
