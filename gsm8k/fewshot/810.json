    "question": "In one year, the number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month. If there are 10 students on campus at the beginning of the year, how many additional students would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year?",
    "completion": "To determine how many additional students joined the campus by the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the number of students at the beginning of May.\n\n1. **End of January:**\n   - Number of students: 10\n   - Number of students at the end of January: \\(10 \\times 2 = 20\\)\n\n2. **End of February:**\n   - Number of students: 20\n   - Number of students at the end of February: \\(20 \\times 2 = 40\\)\n\n3. **End of March:**\n   - Number of students: 40\n   - Number of students at the end of March: \\(40 \\times 2 = 80\\)\n\n4. **End of April:**\n   - Number of students: 80\n   - Number of students at the end of April: \\(80 \\times 2 = 160\\)\n\n5. **End of May:**\n   - Number of students: 160\n   - Number of students at the end of May: \\(160 \\times 2 = 320\\)\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the number of students at the beginning of May:\n\\[ 320 - 10 = 310 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of additional students who joined the campus by the end of May is \\(\\boxed{310}\\).",
    "answer": "At the end of January, the number of students doubles to 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20\nAt the end of February, the number of students increases to 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40\nBy the end of March, the number of students doubles to 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80\nBy the end of April, the number of students is 2*80=<<2*80=160>>160\nAt the end of May, the number of students has doubled to 2*160=<<2*160=320>>320\nIf there were initially 10 students, 320-10=<<320-10=310>>310 students would join the campus by the end of May.\n#### 310"
