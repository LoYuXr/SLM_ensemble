    "question": "Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles. Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. How many marbles does Paul have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after his friend gave him 28 more marbles.\n2. Determine how many marbles Paul lost.\n3. Subtract the number of marbles lost from the total number of marbles he had after his friend gave him the marbles.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Paul initially has 52 marbles. His friend gives him 28 more marbles. So, the total number of marbles Paul has after his friend gives him the marbles is:\n   \\[\n   52 + 28 = 80\n   \\]\n\n2. Paul then loses \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he loses, we calculate \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of 80:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 80 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, Paul loses 20 marbles.\n\n3. To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had after his friend gave him the marbles:\n   \\[\n   80 - 20 = 60\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles Paul has left is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
    "answer": "Paul has a total of 52 + 28 = <<52+28=80>>80 marbles.\nHe lost 1/4 x 80 = <<80/4=20>>20 marbles.\nTherefore, he has 80 - 20 = <<80-20=60>>60 marbles left.\n#### 60"
