    "question": "Three people divided an amount of $1920. The second took $80 more than the first and the third took twice what the second took. Calculate the share of the first one.",
    "completion": "To determine the share of the first person, we start by defining the amounts taken by each person. Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the second person took \\( x + 80 \\) dollars, and the third person took twice what the second person took, which is \\( 2(x + 80) \\) dollars.\n\nThe total amount of money is $1920, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \\]\n\\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting 240 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 4x = 1680 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 4:\n\\[ x = 420 \\]\n\nSo, the first person took $420. To find the share of the first person, we multiply \\( x \\) by 1 (since the problem asks for the share of the first person):\n\\[ 420 \\times 1 = 420 \\]\n\nTherefore, the share of the first person is \\(\\boxed{420}\\).",
    "answer": "Let X be the amount of what the first took.\nThe second took X+<<+80=80>>80.\nThe third took (X+80)*2.\nThe total amount X + (X+80) + (X+80)*2 = 1920.\nX + X + 80 + 2*X + 80*2 = 1920\nX*4 + 240 = 1920.\nX*4 = 1680.\nX = <<420=420>>420.\n#### 420"
