    "question": "John cuts down an 80-foot tree.  He can make logs out of 80% of it. He cuts it into 4-foot logs.  From each of those logs, he cuts 5 planks.  He then sells each plank for $1.2.  How much does he make?",
    "completion": "To determine how much John makes from cutting down and selling the logs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of logs John can make from the tree:**\n   - John cuts down an 80-foot tree.\n   - He can make logs out of 80% of the tree.\n   - Therefore, the number of logs he can make is:\n     \\[\n     80 \\text{ feet} \\times 0.80 = 64 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of planks from each log:**\n   - John cuts each log into 4-foot planks.\n   - Therefore, the number of planks from each log is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ feet} \\div 4 \\text{ feet per plank} = 1 \\text{ plank}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of planks from all the logs:**\n   - John has 64 logs.\n   - Each log contains 1 plank.\n   - Therefore, the total number of planks is:\n     \\[\n     64 \\text{ logs} \\times 1 \\text{ plank per log} = 64 \\text{ planks}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the planks:**\n   - John sells each plank for $1.2.\n   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling the planks is:\n     \\[\n     64 \\text{ planks} \\times 1.2 \\text{ dollars per plank} = 76.80 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total amount John makes from cutting down the tree and selling the planks is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{76.80}\n\\]",
    "answer": "He can use 80*.8=<<80*.8=64>>64 feet of the tree.\nThat means he can make 64/4=<<64/4=16>>16 logs.\nThat gives him16*5=<<16*5=80>>80 planks.\nSo he makes 80*1.2=$<<80*1.2=96>>96.\n#### 96"
