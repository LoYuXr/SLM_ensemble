    "question": "At the local Pick Your Own fruit orchard, you could pick your own peaches for $2.00 per pound, plums were $1.00 per pound and apricots were $3.00 per pound.  If Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches, 8 pounds of plums and 6 pounds of apricots, how much did he spend on fruit?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit he picked and then sum these costs.\n\n1. **Cost of peaches:**\n   - Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches.\n   - The price per pound of peaches is $2.00.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for peaches is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$2.00 \\text{ per pound} = \\$12.00\n     \\]\n\n2. **Cost of plums:**\n   - Winston picked 8 pounds of plums.\n   - The price per pound of plums is $1.00.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for plums is:\n     \\[\n     8 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$1.00 \\text{ per pound} = \\$8.00\n     \\]\n\n3. **Cost of apricots:**\n   - Winston picked 6 pounds of apricots.\n   - The price per pound of apricots is $3.00.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for apricots is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$3.00 \\text{ per pound} = \\$18.00\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total cost:**\n   - To find the total amount Winston spent, we sum the costs of the peaches, plums, and apricots:\n     \\[\n     \\$12.00 + \\$8.00 + \\$18.00 = \\$38.00\n     \\]\n\nThus, Winston spent a total of \\(\\boxed{38.00}\\) dollars on fruit.",
    "answer": "He bought 6 pounds of peaches that are $2.00 per pound so he spent 6*2 = $<<6*2=12.00>>12.00 on peaches\nHe bought 8 pounds of plums that are $1.00 per pound so he spent 8*1 = $<<8*1=8.00>>8.00 on plums\nHe bought 6 pounds of apricots that are $3.00 per pound so he spent 6*3 = $<<6*3=18.00>>18.00 on apricots\nThat day, he spent 12+8+18 = $<<12+8+18=38.00>>38.00 on fruit\n#### 38"
