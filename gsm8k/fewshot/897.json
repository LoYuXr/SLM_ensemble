    "question": "Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Martha decided she needed more notebooks and then bought 5 more for a total of 7 notebooks. How many more than Joseph does she now have?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha originally had as \\( M \\). According to the problem, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph originally had \\( 3M \\) notebooks.\n\nAfter Martha bought 5 more notebooks, the total number of notebooks she had became \\( M + 5 \\). We know that after buying the notebooks, Martha had 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ M + 5 = 7 \\]\n\nTo find the original number of notebooks Martha had, we solve for \\( M \\):\n\n\\[ M = 7 - 5 \\]\n\\[ M = 2 \\]\n\nSo, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. Now, we need to determine how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Joseph originally had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) notebooks. Martha now has 7 notebooks, so she has \\( 7 - 6 = 1 \\) more notebook than Joseph.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Since she bought 5 more to have 7, she originally had 7-5 = <<7-5=2>>2 notebooks\nJoseph had 3 times Martha's number of notebooks which is 3*2 = <<3*2=6>>6 notebooks\nMartha has 7 notebooks now which is 7-6 = <<7-6=1>>1 more than Joseph\n#### 1"
