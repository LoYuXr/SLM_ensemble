    "question": "Denise and Daniel are reading the same book. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages while Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as what Daniel read yesterday, while Daniel was not able to read any pages today. How many more pages did Denise read more than Daniel?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the number of pages each of them read and then find the difference between the two totals.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of pages Denise read:\n- Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.\n- Today, Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday.\n- Therefore, the number of pages Denise read today is \\(10 + 5 = 15\\) pages.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of pages Daniel read:\n- Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.\n- Today, Daniel was not able to read any pages, so he read 0 pages today.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of pages read by Denise and Daniel:\n- Denise read 15 pages.\n- Daniel read 0 pages.\n- Therefore, the total number of pages read by both is \\(15 + 0 = 15\\) pages.\n\nFinally, we find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel:\n- Denise read 15 pages.\n- Daniel read 13 pages.\n- Therefore, the difference is \\(15 - 13 = 2\\) pages.\n\nSo, Denise read \\(\\boxed{2}\\) more pages than Daniel.",
    "answer": "Denise read 13 + 5 = <<13+5=18>>18 pages today.\nShe was able to read 10 + 18 = <<10+18=28>>28 pages in all.\nSo, Denise read 28 - 13 = <<28-13=15>>15 more pages than Daniel.\n#### 15"
