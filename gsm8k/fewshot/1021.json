    "question": "In a 60-item quiz, 40% of the questions are easy, and the rest are equally divided as average and difficult questions. If Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, and half of the average and difficult questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?",
    "completion": "To determine how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of easy and difficult questions:**\n   - The quiz has 60 questions in total.\n   - 40% of the questions are easy.\n   - Therefore, the number of easy questions is \\( 0.40 \\times 60 = 24 \\).\n   - The rest of the questions are difficult, so the number of difficult questions is \\( 60 - 24 = 36 \\).\n\n2. **Determine the number of easy and difficult questions Aries gets:**\n   - Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions.\n   - Therefore, the number of easy questions Aries gets is \\( 0.75 \\times 24 = 18 \\).\n   - Half of the difficult questions are average and difficult, so the number of average and difficult questions Aries gets is \\( \\frac{36}{2} = 18 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the total points Aries gets:**\n   - Aries gets 18 easy questions correct.\n   - Aries gets 18 average and difficult questions correct.\n   - Therefore, the total points Aries gets is \\( 18 \\times 1 = 18 \\).\n\nSo, the number of points Aries is sure to get is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
    "answer": "The average and difficult questions comprises 100% - 40% = 60% of the quiz.\nThere are 60 questions x 40/100 = <<60*40/100=24>>24 easy questions.\nThere are a total of 60 questions x 60/100 = <<60*60/100=36>>36 average and difficult questions.\nIf Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, then this means she is sure of her 24 questions x 75/100 = <<24*75/100=18>>18 points.\nFrom the average and difficult questions, she is sure to get half of it correctly so that is 36 questions / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 points.\nThus, she is sure of getting 18 points + 18 points = <<18+18=36>>36 points in her quiz.\n#### 36"
