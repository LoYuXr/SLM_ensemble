    "question": "Gissela, Gordy, and Gary are truck drivers.  Gissela has a truck large enough to haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.  And when Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( G \\) be the weight of Gissela's truck in pounds.\n   - Let \\( D \\) be the weight of Gordy's truck in pounds.\n   - Let \\( G' \\) be the weight of Gary's truck in pounds.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations:**\n   - Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.\n     \\[\n     G = 4000\n     \\]\n   - Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.\n     \\[\n     D = G + 800\n     \\]\n   - When Gary's truck is added to Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, the combined weight is 11,600 pounds.\n     \\[\n     G + G' + D = 11600\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute \\( G \\) and \\( D \\) into the Combined Weight Equation:**\n   \\[\n   4000 + G' + (G + 800) = 11600\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   4000 + G' + G + 800 = 11600\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4800 + G' + G = 11600\n   \\]\n\n5. **Isolate \\( G' + G \\):**\n   \\[\n   G' + G = 11600 - 4800\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   G' + G = 6800\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the Weight of Gary's Truck:**\n   - Since \\( G' + G = 6800 \\), we need to find \\( G' \\).\n   - We know \\( G = 4000 \\) pounds.\n   - Therefore, \\( G' = 6800 - 4000 \\)\n   \\[\n   G' = 2800\n   \\]\n\nThus, Gary's truck can carry \\(\\boxed{2800}\\) pounds of gravel.",
    "answer": "Gordy's truck can carry 4000+800=<<4000+800=4800>>4800 pounds of gravel.\nThus, Gary's truck can carry 11,600-4000-4800=<<11600-4000-4800=2800>>2800 pounds of gravel.\n#### 2800"
