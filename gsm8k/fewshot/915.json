    "question": "Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday. On Wednesday he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. On Thursday he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. How many hours does Bruce work in all these three days?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Hours worked on Tuesday:**\n   Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday.\n\n2. **Hours worked on Wednesday:**\n   On Wednesday, Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Wednesday is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hours worked on Thursday:**\n   On Thursday, Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Thursday is:\n   \\[\n   10 - 2 = 8 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total hours worked over the three days:**\n   To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we sum the hours worked on each day:\n   \\[\n   5 + 10 + 8 = 23 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours Bruce works in all three days is \\(\\boxed{23}\\).",
    "answer": "On Wednesday, Bruce works for 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 hours.\nOn Thursday, Bruce works for 10 \u2013 2 = <<10-2=8>>8 hours.\nOn these three days, Bruce works for 5 + 10 + 8 = <<5+10+8=23>>23 hours.\n#### 23"
