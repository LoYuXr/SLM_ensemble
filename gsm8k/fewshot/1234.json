    "question": "Regina wrote 9 novels last year. If this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, how many novels has she written this year?",
    "completion": "To determine how many novels Regina has written this year, we start by understanding the relationship between the number of novels she wrote last year and this year. According to the problem, last year she wrote 9 novels, which is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year.\n\nLet's denote the number of novels Regina has written this year as \\( x \\). According to the problem, last year she wrote 3 quarters of this year's total, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ 9 = \\frac{3}{4}x \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve for \\( x \\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), which is \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\):\n\\[ x = 9 \\times \\frac{4}{3} \\]\n\nNow, we perform the multiplication:\n\\[ x = 9 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 9 \\times 1.3333\\ldots = 11.9999\\ldots \\]\n\nSince the number of novels must be a whole number, and the problem implies that the number of novels written this year is a whole number, we can conclude that the correct interpretation is that the number of novels written this year is 11.9999... which, when rounded to the nearest whole number, is 12.\n\nTherefore, the number of novels Regina has written this year is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
    "answer": "Number of novels she wrote last year = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year\n9 = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year\nMultiplying both sides by 4/3 gives the number of novels she has written this year = (4/3)*9 = <<4/3*9=12>>12 novels\n#### 12"
