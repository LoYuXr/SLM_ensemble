    "question": "A class of 50 students has various hobbies. 10 like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and the rest like to either play video games or play music. How many like to play video games if the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball?",
    "completion": "To determine how many students like to play video games, we start by defining the variables and using the given information.\n\nLet:\n- \\( B \\) be the number of students who like to bake.\n- \\( P \\) be the number of students who like to play basketball.\n- \\( V \\) be the number of students who like to play video games.\n- \\( M \\) be the number of students who like to play music.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. The total number of students is 50.\n2. The number of students who like to bake is 10.\n3. The number of students who like to play basketball is 5.\n4. The number of students who like to play video games is twice the number who like to play basketball.\n5. The number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball.\n\nFirst, we can express the total number of students as:\n\\[ B + P + V + M = 50 \\]\n\nWe know \\( B = 10 \\) and \\( P = 5 \\). Substituting these values into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 10 + 5 + V + M = 50 \\]\n\\[ 15 + V + M = 50 \\]\n\\[ V + M = 35 \\]\n\nNext, we use the information about the number of students who like to play video games. The number of students who like to play video games is twice the number who like to play basketball:\n\\[ V = 2P \\]\nSubstituting \\( P = 5 \\) into this equation, we get:\n\\[ V = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\n\nNow, we substitute \\( V = 10 \\) and \\( M = 35 - V \\) into the equation \\( V + M = 35 \\):\n\\[ 10 + (35 - 10) = 35 \\]\n\\[ 10 + 25 = 35 \\]\n\\[ 35 = 35 \\]\n\nThis confirms our calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",
    "answer": "The number of students that like to play music is twice as many as the number who like basketball, so 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10\nThe number that like to play video games is 50 total students - 10 baking - 5 basketball - 10 music = <<50-10-5-10=25>>25\n#### 25"
