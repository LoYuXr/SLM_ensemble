    "question": "A zookeeper is counting how many lions are in their enclosure. She counts 12 female lions, half as many male lions, and 14 lion cubs. How many lions are in the enclosure?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs separately, and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Number of female lions:**\n   The zookeeper counts 12 female lions.\n\n2. **Number of male lions:**\n   The zookeeper counts half as many male lions as female lions. Therefore, the number of male lions is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of lion cubs:**\n   The zookeeper counts 14 lion cubs.\n\n4. **Total number of lions:**\n   To find the total number of lions, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ (female lions)} + 6 \\text{ (male lions)} + 14 \\text{ (lion cubs)} = 32\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of lions in the enclosure is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
    "answer": "There are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 male lions in the enclosure.\nSo there is a total of 12 + 6 + 14 = <<12+6+14=32>>32 lions in the enclosure.\n#### 32"
