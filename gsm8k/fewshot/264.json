    "question": "Carmen has $100, Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, and Daisy has $50 more than Samantha. How much do all three girls have combined?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the amount of money each girl has.\n2. Sum the amounts of money each girl has.\n\nFirst, we know that Carmen has $100.\n\nNext, we calculate how much money Samantha has. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen. Therefore, we add $25 to the amount Carmen has:\n\\[ 100 + 25 = 125 \\]\nSo, Samantha has $125.\n\nThen, we calculate how much money Daisy has. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha. Therefore, we add $50 to the amount Samantha has:\n\\[ 125 + 50 = 175 \\]\nSo, Daisy has $175.\n\nNow, we sum the amounts of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have:\n\\[ 100 + 125 + 175 = 400 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money that all three girls have combined is \\(\\boxed{400}\\).",
    "answer": "Samantha has $100+$25 = $<<100+25=125>>125.\nDaisy has $125+$50 = $<<125+50=175>>175.\nThe total amount of money that the three girls have is $175+$125+$100 = $<<175+125+100=400>>400.\n#### 400"
