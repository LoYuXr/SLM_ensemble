    "question": "Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. If Bo has 40 crabs, calculate the total number of crabs the three have together.",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of crabs Bo has.\n2. Calculate the number of crabs Rani has.\n3. Calculate the number of crabs Monic has.\n4. Sum the number of crabs Rani, Monic, and Bo have.\n\nFirst, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. So, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Bo's crabs} = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Monic has as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Monic's crabs} = \\text{Bo's crabs} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \\]\n\nNow, we know that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Rani has as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Rani's crabs} = \\text{Monic's crabs} + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46 \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the number of crabs Rani, Monic, and Bo have:\n\\[ \\text{Total crabs} = \\text{Rani's crabs} + \\text{Monic's crabs} + \\text{Bo's crabs} = 46 + 36 + 40 = 122 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:\n\\[ \\boxed{122} \\]",
    "answer": "If Bo has 40 crabs, then Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, has 40-4 = <<40-4=36>>36 crabs.\nBo and Monic have a total of 36+40 = <<36+40=76>>76 crabs.\nSince Monic has 36 crabs, Rani's number of crabs is 36+ 10 = <<36+10=46>>46.\nTogether, the three have 76+46 = <<76+46=122>>122 crabs.\n#### 122"
