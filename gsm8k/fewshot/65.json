    "question": "Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and reads for half as long.  He does this 3 times a week.  How many hours does he spend on TV and reading in 4 weeks?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the time spent reading in one week:**\n   Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV. Since he spends 2 hours watching TV, he reads for:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2 \\text{ hours}}{2} = 1 \\text{ hour}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, in one week, Jim reads for 1 hour.\n\n2. **Calculate the total time spent reading in 4 weeks:**\n   Since Jim reads for 1 hour each week, in 4 weeks he reads:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ hour/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total time spent watching TV in 4 weeks:**\n   Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each week. Therefore, in 4 weeks he spends:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 8 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total time spent on both TV and reading in 4 weeks:**\n   Adding the time spent watching TV and the time spent reading, we get:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ hours} + 4 \\text{ hours} = 12 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is \\boxed{12}.",
    "answer": "He reads for 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 hour a night\nSo he spends 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 hours on these activities\nThat means he spends 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 hours a week on them\nSo in 4 weeks, he spends 9*4=<<9*4=36>>36 hours on these activities\n#### 36"
