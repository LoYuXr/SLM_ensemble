    "question": "Maddy is buying pizza for her cousin's soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests. A pizza will serve 3 people. If each pizza costs $15, how many dollars will Maddy spend?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Maddy will spend on pizza, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of people at the soccer game.\n2. Determine how many pizzas are needed.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the pizzas.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of people at the soccer game.**\n\nThere are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of people is:\n\\[ 12 + 3 = 15 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many pizzas are needed.**\n\nEach pizza serves 3 people, so the number of pizzas needed is:\n\\[ \\frac{15}{3} = 5 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the pizzas.**\n\nEach pizza costs $15, so the total cost for 5 pizzas is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 15 = 75 \\]\n\nTherefore, Maddy will spend \\(\\boxed{75}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Maddy is buying pizza for 12 + 3 + (12*2) = <<12+3+12*2=39>>39 people.\nThus, she needs to buy 39/3=<<39/3=13>>13 pizzas.\nThus, she will spend $15*13=$<<15*13=195>>195.\n#### 195"
