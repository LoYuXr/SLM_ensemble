    "question": "Stephen placed an online order for groceries.  His final bill came to $40.00.  Because this was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a 25% fee to his final total and charged him $3.00 in delivery fees.  Stephen also added a $4.00 tip.  After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?",
    "completion": "To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total extra fees:**\n   - Delivery fee: $3.00\n   - Tip: $4.00\n   - Total extra fees: $3.00 + $4.00 = $7.00\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount before the delivery fee:**\n   - Total bill: $40.00\n   - Extra fees: $7.00\n   - Total amount before delivery: $40.00 + $7.00 = $47.00\n\n3. **Calculate the delivery fee:**\n   - Delivery fee: $3.00\n\n4. **Calculate the final price of the groceries:**\n   - Total amount before delivery: $47.00\n   - Delivery fee: $3.00\n   - Final price: $47.00 - $3.00 = $44.00\n\nTherefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is \\(\\boxed{44.00}\\).",
    "answer": "He spent $40.00 on groceries but they charged him a 25% fee so that's 40*.25 = $10.00\nThere is also a $3.00 delivery fee and a $4.00 tip for an extra $3 + $4 = $<<3+4=7.00>>7.00 in fees\nHis groceries were $40.00, there's a $10.00 fee plus another $7.00 in delivery/tip fees for a final total of $40 + $10 + $7 = $<<40+10+7=57.00>>57.00\n#### 57"
