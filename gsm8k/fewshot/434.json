    "question": "The vending machines sell chips for 40 cents and candy bars for 75 cents. George spent $5 and got 3 bags of chips and had 1% of his money left. How many candy bars did he buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how many candy bars George bought, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money George spent.\n2. Determine how much money George had left after buying the chips.\n3. Use the information about the candy bars to find out how many he bought.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money George spent. He spent $5, and each bag of chips costs 40 cents. Since he bought 3 bags of chips, the total cost of the chips is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\text{ cents} = 1.20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we know that after buying the chips, George had 1% of his money left. This means he had 99% of his money left. Let's denote the total amount of money George had before buying the chips as \\( M \\). After spending $5 on chips, he had \\( M - 5 \\) dollars left. According to the problem, this amount is 99% of his original money:\n\\[ M - 5 = 0.99M \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( M \\):\n\\[ M - 5 = 0.99M \\]\n\\[ M - 0.99M = 5 \\]\n\\[ 0.01M = 5 \\]\n\\[ M = \\frac{5}{0.01} \\]\n\\[ M = 500 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, George had $500 before buying the chips. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars he bought is:\n\\[ \\frac{500}{75} = \\frac{500 \\div 25}{75 \\div 25} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.67 \\]\n\nSince George can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, George bought 6 candy bars.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",
    "answer": "George got $.05 in change because 5 x .01 = <<5*.01=.05>>.05\nGeorge spent $4.95 because 5 - .05 = <<5-.05=4.95>>4.95\nGeorge spent $1.2 on chips because 3 x .4 = <<3*.4=1.2>>1.2\nGeorge spent 3.75 on candy bars because 4.95 - 1.2 = <<4.95-1.2=3.75>>3.75\nGeorge bought 5 candy bars because 3.75 / .75 = <<5=5>>5\n#### 5"
