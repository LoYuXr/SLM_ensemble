    "question": "Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory\u2019s dog and another dog that is half the weight of Kory\u2019s dog. If Kory\u2019s dog is 60 pounds, how much do Elijah and Kory\u2019s dogs weigh altogether, in pounds?",
    "completion": "To determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the weight of Kory's dog.\n2. Calculate the weight of Elijah's dog.\n3. Add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's dog to find the total weight.\n\nFirst, we know that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.\n\nNext, we calculate the weight of Elijah's dog. According to the problem, Elijah's dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:\n\\[\n\\text{Weight of Elijah's dog} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 60 = 15 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate the weight of Kory's dog's other dog. The problem states that this dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:\n\\[\n\\text{Weight of the other dog} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 = 30 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's dog to find the total weight:\n\\[\n\\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is \\boxed{105} pounds.",
    "answer": "Elijah\u2019s first dog is 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 pounds\nElijah\u2019s second dog is 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 pounds\nThe total weight of Elijah and Kory\u2019s dogs is 15 + 30 + 60 = <<15+30+60=105>>105 pounds\n#### 105"
