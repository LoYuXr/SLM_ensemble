    "question": "Peter wants to make different sized ice cubes with 32 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 4 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 2 ounces, and small cubes that use 1/2 an ounce. If he makes 3 giant cubes, 7 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes, how many ounces of water does he have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces of water.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of water used for the giant cubes:\n- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.\n- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.\n- Therefore, the total water used for the giant cubes is \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) ounces.\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of water used for the medium cubes:\n- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.\n- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.\n- Therefore, the total water used for the medium cubes is \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\) ounces.\n\nThen, let's calculate the amount of water used for the small cubes:\n- Each small cube uses \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) ounce of water.\n- Peter makes 8 small cubes.\n- Therefore, the total water used for the small cubes is \\(8 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 4\\) ounces.\n\nNow, we sum up the water used for all the cubes:\n- Total water used = water used for giant cubes + water used for medium cubes + water used for small cubes\n- Total water used = \\(12 + 14 + 4 = 20\\) ounces.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:\n- Water left = initial water - total water used\n- Water left = \\(32 - 20 = 12\\) ounces.\n\nThus, the amount of water Peter has left is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) ounces.",
    "answer": "The giant cubes used up 12 ounces of water because 3 times 4 equals <<3*4=12>>12.\nThe medium cubes used up 14 ounces of water because 7 times 2 equals <<7*2=14>>14.\nThe small cubes used up 4 ounces of water because 8 times 1/2 equals 4.\nThis means that Peter has used up 30 ounces of water because 12 plus 14 plus 4 equals 30.\nPeter has 2 ounces of water left because 32 minus 30 equals <<32-30=2>>2.\n#### 2"
