    "completion": "To determine the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up, including the delivery fee and tip.\n\n1. **Cost of Subs:**\n   - Rory orders 2 subs for $7.50 each.\n   - Total cost for subs: \\( 2 \\times 7.50 = 15.00 \\).\n\n2. **Cost of Bags of Chips:**\n   - Rory orders 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each.\n   - Total cost for chips: \\( 2 \\times 1.50 = 3.00 \\).\n\n3. **Cost of Cookies:**\n   - Rory orders 2 cookies for $1.00 each.\n   - Total cost for cookies: \\( 2 \\times 1.00 = 2.00 \\).\n\n4. **Delivery Fee:**\n   - There is a 20% delivery fee added at check out.\n   - Delivery fee: \\( 0.20 \\times 15.00 = 3.00 \\).\n\n5. **Tip:**\n   - Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip.\n   - Total cost including tip: \\( 15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 + 3.00 + 5.00 = 28.00 \\).\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is **$28.00**.",
    "answer": "2 subs are $7.50 each so that\u2019s 2*7.50 = $<<2*7.5=15.00>>15.00\n2 bags of chips are $1.50 each so that\u2019s 2*1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00\n2 cookies are $1.00 each so that\u2019s 2*1 = $<<2*1=2.00>>2.00\nHer delivery order will be 15+3+2= $<<15+3+2=20.00>>20.00\nThere\u2019s a 20% delivery fee on the $20.00 which adds .20*20 = $4.00 to her bill\nThe delivery order is $20.00, there\u2019s a $4.00 delivery fee and she adds a $5.00 tip for a total of 20+4+5 = $<<20+4+5=29.00>>29.00\n#### 29"
