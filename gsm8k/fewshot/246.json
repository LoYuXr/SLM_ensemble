    "question": "Jeans makeup artist charges her $250 an hour.  She requires very expensive makeup for a movie she is in and it takes 6 hours to do each day and she needs it done 4 times a week.  The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.  After the movie is done the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done.  How much did Jean pay?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of hours needed for the makeup:**\n   - Each day, it takes 6 hours to complete the makeup.\n   - She needs it done 4 times a week.\n   - Therefore, the total number of hours needed for the makeup is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 96 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the makeup:**\n   - The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for 96 hours is:\n     \\[\n     250 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 96 \\text{ hours} = 24000 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the discount:**\n   - The makeup artist gives a 10% discount on the total cost.\n   - The discount amount is:\n     \\[\n     24000 \\text{ dollars} \\times 0.10 = 2400 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the final amount Jean paid:**\n   - Subtract the discount from the total cost:\n     \\[\n     24000 \\text{ dollars} - 2400 \\text{ dollars} = 21600 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the amount Jean paid for the makeup artist's services is \\(\\boxed{21600}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Jean pays 250*6=$<<250*6=1500>>1500 a day\nSo he pays 1500*4=$<<1500*4=6000>>6000 a week\nSo the work cost 6000*5=$<<6000*5=30000>>30,000\nThey give a discount of 30,000*.1=$<<30000*.1=3000>>3000\nSo the total cost paid is 30,000-3000=$<<30000-3000=27000>>27,000\n#### 27000"
