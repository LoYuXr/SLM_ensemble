    "question": "There are four birds at the Caboose. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. If Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, what's the total age of the four birds?",
    "completion": "To determine the total age of the four birds, we need to find the ages of each bird step by step.\n\n1. **Sally Four's age:**\n   Sally Four is 8 years old.\n\n2. **Sally Two's age:**\n   Sally Two is three years older than Sally Four.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sally Two's age} = 8 + 3 = 11 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Granny Red's age:**\n   Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Granny Red's age} = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Sally Thirty-two's age:**\n   Sally Thirty-two is the same age as Sally Four.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sally Thirty-two's age} = 8 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum the ages of all four birds:\n\\[\n\\text{Total age} = \\text{Sally Four's age} + \\text{Sally Two's age} + \\text{Granny Red's age} + \\text{Sally Thirty-two's age}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total age} = 8 + 11 + 16 + 8 = 43 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total age of the four birds is \\(\\boxed{43}\\).",
    "answer": "If Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, same as Sally four, their total age 8+8 = <<8+8=16>>16 years.\nGranny red is two times as old as Sally four, meaning Granny red is 2*8 = <<2*8=16>>16 years old.\nSally Thirtytwo, Sally four, and Sally red are 16+16 = <<32=32>>32 years old.\nSally two is three years older than Granny red, meaning Sally two is 16+3= <<16+3=19>>19 years old.\nThe four birds have a total age of 32+19 = <<32+19=51>>51 years old.\n#### 51"
