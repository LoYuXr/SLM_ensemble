    "question": "In his training as a professional athlete, Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach, however, wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. If he took the coach's advice and trained for a month, what is the total distance he covered in June?",
    "completion": "To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the distance Tyson runs in a day after the coach's advice.\n2. Determine the total distance he runs in June by multiplying the daily distance by the number of days in June.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many meters Tyson runs in a day after the coach's advice. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he runs every day. So, we calculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance per day after the coach's advice} = 5000 \\text{ meters} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 1000 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many meters he runs in June. Since June has 30 days, we multiply the daily distance by 30:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total distance in June} = 1000 \\text{ meters/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 30000 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30000} \\]",
    "answer": "Tyson's coach wants him to run 1/5 * 5000 meters = <<5000/5=1000>>1000 more meters per day.\nWhen he took the coach's advice, he increased the training distance he runs per day to 5000 meters + 1000 meters = <<5000+1000=6000>>6000 meters.\nHe covered 6000 meters/day * 30 days/month =<<6000*30=180000>>180000 meters in June on his training sessions.\n#### 180000"
