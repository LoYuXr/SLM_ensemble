    "question": "Ava and Emma want to know who is better at the new video game Ava got for her birthday. They are each going to play one level and whoever has the highest score wins. They receive 10 points for every enemy they jump on, 5 points for each berry they collect, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level. If Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries, but finishes the level 4 seconds slower, what is the difference between their two scores?",
    "completion": "To determine the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we need to calculate their scores based on the given points system and the differences in their actions.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- Let \\( E \\) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of berries Emma collects.\n- Let \\( T \\) be the number of seconds Emma finishes the level.\n\nGiven the information:\n- Emma finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Ava.\n- Emma jumps on 8 more enemies than Ava.\n- Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava.\n\nWe can express these relationships mathematically:\n1. Emma finishes the level \\( T - 4 \\) seconds after Ava.\n2. Emma jumps on \\( E + 8 \\) enemies.\n3. Emma collects \\( B + 3 \\) berries.\n\nThe points system is:\n- 10 points for every enemy jumped on.\n- 5 points for every berry collected.\n- 30 points for every second left on the timer.\n\nNow, let's calculate Ava's score:\n- Ava jumps on \\( E \\) enemies.\n- Ava collects \\( B \\) berries.\n- Ava finishes the level \\( T - 4 \\) seconds after Emma.\n\nThe points Ava scores are:\n\\[ \\text{Points for enemies} = 10 \\times (E + 8) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Points for berries} = 5 \\times B \\]\n\\[ \\text{Points for seconds left} = 30 \\times (T - 4) \\]\n\nSo, Ava's total score is:\n\\[ \\text{Ava's score} = 10 \\times (E + 8) + 5 \\times B + 30 \\times (T - 4) \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate Emma's score:\n- Emma finishes the level \\( T - 4 \\) seconds after Ava.\n- Emma jumps on \\( E + 8 \\) enemies.\n- Emma collects \\( B + 3 \\) berries.\n\nThe points Emma scores are:\n\\[ \\text{Points for enemies} = 10 \\times (E + 8) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Points for berries} = 5 \\times (B + 3) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Points for seconds left} = 30 \\times (T - 4) \\]\n\nSo, Emma's total score is:\n\\[ \\text{Emma's score} = ",
    "answer": "For jumping on enemies, Emma earns 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 fewer points than Ava.\nFor collecting berries, Emma earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 fewer points than Ava.\nFor finishing the level faster, Emma earns 4 * 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 more points than Ava.\nOverall, Emma has 120 \u2013 80 - 15 = <<120-80-15=25>>25 more points than Ava.\n#### 25"
