    "question": "Cecilia just bought a new puppy. According to her veterinarian, she has to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Then she has to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life. If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?",
    "completion": "To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food consumed over the first 180 days and then convert that amount into bags of dog food.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of dog food consumed in the first 180 days:\n- For the first 180 days, the puppy is fed 1 cup of dog food per day.\n- Therefore, the total amount of dog food consumed in the first 180 days is:\n  \\[\n  180 \\text{ days} \\times 1 \\text{ cup/day} = 180 \\text{ cups}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how much dog food is consumed in the remaining 180 days of the puppy's life. The puppy is fed 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of its life, which is:\n- For the remaining 180 days, the puppy is fed:\n  \\[\n  180 \\text{ days} \\times 2 \\text{ cups/day} = 360 \\text{ cups}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we add the amounts of dog food consumed in both periods to find the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:\n\\[\n180 \\text{ cups} + 360 \\text{ cups} = 540 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we need to convert the total amount of dog food consumed into bags. Since one bag contains 110 cups, we divide the total amount of dog food by the number of cups per bag:\n\\[\n\\frac{540 \\text{ cups}}{110 \\text{ cups/bag}} = \\frac{540}{110} \\approx 4.9091 \\text{ bags}\n\\]\n\nSince we cannot use a fraction of a bag, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The number of cups of dog food given for the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = <<180*1=180>>180 cups\nThe number of days left in the year is 365 - 180 = <<365-180=185>>185\nThe number of cups of dog food given for the rest of the first year is 185 * 2 = <<185*2=370>>370 cups\nThe total number of cups given in the first year is 180 + 370 = <<180+370=550>>550 cups\nThe number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = <<550/110=5>>5 bags\n#### 5"
