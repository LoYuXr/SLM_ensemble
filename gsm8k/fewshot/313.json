    "question": "Six years ago, when Noah was half as old as Cera, the population of Chile was half what it is now. Currently, Cera is 46 years old. If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, calculate the population of Chile now.",
    "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.\n   - The population of Chile was half what it is now.\n   - Cera is currently 46 years old.\n   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah.\n\n2. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**\n   - Let \\( N \\) be Noah's age six years ago.\n   - According to the problem, Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago.\n   - Therefore, \\( N = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 46 = 23 \\) years old.\n\n3. **Determine Cera's age six years ago:**\n   - Cera is currently 46 years old.\n   - Therefore, six years ago, Cera was \\( 46 - 6 = 40 \\) years old.\n\n4. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**\n   - The population of Chile was half what it is now.\n   - Let \\( P \\) be the current population of Chile.\n   - Therefore, \\( P = \\frac{1}{2} \\times P \\).\n\n5. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**\n   - According to the problem, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah.\n   - Therefore, \\( P = 3000 \\times 23 \\).\n\n6. **Calculate the current population of Chile:**\n   - \\( P = 3000 \\times 23 = 69000 \\) years old.\n\nThus, the current population of Chile is \\(\\boxed{69000}\\).",
    "answer": "If Cera is 46 years old now, she was 46-6 = <<46-6=40>>40 years old six years ago.\nSix years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, meaning Noah was 1/2*40 = 20 years.\nIf the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, there were 3000*20 = <<3000*20=60000>>60000 people living in chile.\nSince the population of Chile was half what it was now six years ago, currently Chile has 60000*2 = <<60000*2=120000>>120000 people\n#### 120000"
