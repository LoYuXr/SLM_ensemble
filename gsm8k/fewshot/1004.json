    "question": "Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, while Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each. If Peter and Martha have totals of 64 and 56 chocolate bars respectively, how many more chocolate bars does Peter have in each box than Martha?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of chocolate bars each person has.\n2. Find the difference between the total number of chocolate bars Peter has and the total number of chocolate bars Martha has.\n3. Determine how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars each person has:\n- Peter has 4 boxes, and each box contains the same number of chocolate bars. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box by \\( x \\). Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is \\( 4x \\).\n- Martha has 7 boxes, and each box contains the same number of chocolate bars. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box by \\( y \\). Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is \\( 7y \\).\n\nNext, we know the total number of chocolate bars each person has:\n- Peter has 64 chocolate bars.\n- Martha has 56 chocolate bars.\n\nWe can set up the following equations based on the information given:\n\\[ 4x = 64 \\]\n\\[ 7y = 56 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{64}{4} = 16 \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{56}{7} = 8 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = x - y = 16 - 8 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, Peter has \\(\\boxed{8}\\) more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.",
    "answer": "Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 equal boxes so there are 64/4 = <<64/4=16>>16 bars in each box\nMartha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 equal boxes so there are 56/7 = <<56/7=8>>8 bars in each box\nPeter has 16-8 = <<16-8=8>>8 bars more than Martha in each box\n#### 8"
