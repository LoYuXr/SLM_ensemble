    "question": "Mazie has 52 marbles and gives them to twins, Dallas and Darla.  If Dallas has a total of 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them in the playground, how many did Mazie give to Darla?",
    "completion": "To determine how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of marbles Mazie had before giving any to Darla:**\n   Mazie starts with 52 marbles.\n\n2. **Determine how many marbles Mazie had after giving some to Dallas:**\n   Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them in the playground.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of marbles Mazie gave to Dallas:**\n   Dallas originally had 21 marbles, but he dropped 4 of them. Therefore, the number of marbles he has left is:\n   \\[\n   21 - 4 = 17\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla:**\n   Mazie originally had 52 marbles and gave some to Darla. After giving marbles to Dallas, Mazie had 17 marbles left. Therefore, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:\n   \\[\n   52 - 17 = 35\n   \\]\n\nThus, Mazie gave \\(\\boxed{35}\\) marbles to Darla.",
    "answer": "Mazie gave Dallas 21 + 4 = <<21+4=25>>25 marbles.\nDarla has 52 - 25 = <<52-25=27>>27 marbles.\n#### 27"
