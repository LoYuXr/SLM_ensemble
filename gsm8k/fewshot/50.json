    "question": "Lloyd has an egg farm. His chickens produce 252 eggs per day and he sells them for $2 per dozen. How much does Lloyd make on eggs per week?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of eggs Lloyd produces in a week.\n2. Determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces in a week.\n3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many eggs Lloyd produces in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs produced per day by 7:\n\n\\[ 252 \\text{ eggs/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 1764 \\text{ eggs/week} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces in a week. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:\n\n\\[ 1764 \\text{ eggs/week} \\div 12 \\text{ eggs/dozen} = 146 \\text{ dozens/week} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. Since each dozen sells for $2, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:\n\n\\[ 146 \\text{ dozens/week} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/dozen} = 292 \\text{ dollars/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Lloyd makes on eggs per week is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{292} \\]",
    "answer": "In a week, Lloyd's egg farm produces 252 x 7 = <<252*7=1764>>1764 eggs.\nThere are 1764/12 = <<1764/12=147>>147 dozens of eggs produced in a week.\nSo, Lloyd makes 147 x $2 = $<<147*2=294>>294 on eggs.\n#### 294"
