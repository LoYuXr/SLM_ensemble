    "question": "Alfie, the albatross, flies 400 kilometers every day.  If the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, how many days will it take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth?",
    "completion": "To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance around the Earth.\n2. Determine half of that distance.\n3. Calculate how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance.\n\nFirst, we know the circumference of the Earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:\n\\[\n\\frac{40,000 \\text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers. Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, the number of days required is:\n\\[\n\\frac{20,000 \\text{ km}}{400 \\text{ km/day}} = 50 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Alfie \\boxed{50} days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.",
    "answer": "Half of 40,000 kilometers is 40,000/2=<<40000/2=20000>>20,000 kilometers.\nAt 400 kilometers per day, it will take Alfie 20,000/400=50 days to fly a distance equal to half the earth's circumference.\n#### 50"
