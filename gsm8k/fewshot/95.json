    "question": "Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. How many girls are not in the girl scout?",
    "completion": "To determine how many girls are not in the girl scout, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of boys.\n2. Calculate the number of girls.\n3. Determine how many girls are in the girl scout.\n4. Subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of boys:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of boys} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 200 = \\frac{2 \\times 200}{5} = \\frac{400}{5} = 80\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the number of girls:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120\n   \\]\n\n3. Determine how many girls are in the girl scout:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 120 = \\frac{2 \\times 120}{3} = \\frac{240}{3} = 80\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is \\boxed{40}.",
    "answer": "There are 200 x 2/5 = <<200*2/5=80>>80 boys in Grade 5.\nSo, 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 are girls.\nOut of the 120 girls, 120 x 2/3 = <<120*2/3=80>>80 are in the girl scout.\nTherefore, 120 - 80 = <<120-80=40>>40 girls are not in the girl scout.\n#### 40"
