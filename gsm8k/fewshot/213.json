    "question": "While at the dollar store, Sloane counts 100 customers entering the store. The next day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day. If the total number of customers by the third day was 500, how many customers did she count on the third day?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of customers counted on the first day.\n2. Calculate the number of customers counted on the second day.\n3. Use the total number of customers counted on the third day to find the number of customers counted on the third day.\n\nLet's start with the first day:\n- On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of customers counted on the second day:\n- On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day.\n- Therefore, the number of customers counted on the second day is \\(100 + 50 = 150\\).\n\nNow, we know the total number of customers counted on the first and second days:\n- The total number of customers counted on the first and second days is \\(100 + 150 = 250\\).\n\nWe are also given that the total number of customers counted on the third day is 500. To find the number of customers counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers counted on the third day:\n- The number of customers counted on the third day is \\(500 - 250 = 250\\).\n\nThus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \\(\\boxed{250}\\).",
    "answer": "On the second day, she counted 100+50 = <<100+50=150>>150 customers.\nThe total for the first two days is 150+100 = <<150+100=250>>250 customers.\nIf the total count for three days was 500, she counted 500-250 = <<500-250=250>>250 customers on the third day.\n#### 250"
