    "question": "The bananas at the supermarket cost $0.80 each, or a bunch for $3.00.  Jenny buys 10 bunches that average 4 bananas per bunch. How much money, in dollars, did she save by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches, and then find the difference between the two.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually:\n- Each bunch contains 4 bananas.\n- Jenny buys 10 bunches.\n- Therefore, the total number of bananas is \\(10 \\times 4 = 40\\).\n- The cost of each bunch is $3.00.\n- The total cost of buying the bananas individually is \\(40 \\times 3 = 120\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches:\n- Each bunch costs $3.00.\n- Jenny buys 10 bunches.\n- The total cost of buying the bananas in bunches is \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\) dollars.\n\nNow, we find the difference between the total cost of buying the bananas individually and the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches:\n- The difference is \\(120 - 30 = 90\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, Jenny saved \\(\\boxed{90}\\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.",
    "answer": "Ten bunches makes 10*3=$<<10*3=30>>30.\nThere are 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 bananas.\n40 bananas would cost 40*0.80=$<<40*0.80=32>>32 individually.\nShe saved 32-30=<<32-30=2>>2 dollars\n#### 2"
