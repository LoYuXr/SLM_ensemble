    "question": "Howard spends $8 dollars at the arcade on Monday. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much at the arcade as he did on Monday. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much at the arcade as he spent on Tuesday. If he originally had $100, how much money does he have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Howard has left after his arcade visits, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract that from his original amount.\n\n1. **Monday:**\n   Howard spends $8 at the arcade.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money spent on Monday} = \\$8\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tuesday:**\n   Howard spends twice as much as he did on Monday.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money spent on Tuesday} = 2 \\times \\$8 = \\$16\n   \\]\n\n3. **Wednesday:**\n   Howard spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money spent on Wednesday} = 4 \\times \\$16 = \\$64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total spent:**\n   Add the amounts spent on each day.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total spent} = \\$8 + \\$16 + \\$64 = \\$88\n   \\]\n\n5. **Money left:**\n   Subtract the total amount spent from Howard's original amount.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money left} = \\$100 - \\$88 = \\$12\n   \\]\n\nThus, Howard has \\(\\boxed{12}\\) dollars left.",
    "answer": "On Tuesday, he spends $8 * 2 = $<<8*2=16>>16.\nOn Wednesday, he spends $16 * 4 = $<<16*4=64>>64.\nIn total he spent $8 + $16 + $64 = $<<8+16+64=88>>88 at the arcade.\nHe has $100 - $88 = $<<100-88=12>>12 left.\n#### 12"
