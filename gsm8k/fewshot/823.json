    "question": "Sasha and Julie are best friends playing on opposing basketball teams. The teams have two practice games scheduled. In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. Sasha always struggles during away games and their second match was at Julie's home court. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. How many total points did Sasha score during both games?",
    "completion": "To determine the total points scored by Sasha during both games, we need to calculate the points scored by each player in each game and then sum them up.\n\n1. **First Game:**\n   - Sasha scored 14 points.\n   - Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game.\n   - Therefore, Julie scored \\( 14 - 4 = 10 \\) points.\n\n2. **Second Game:**\n   - Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie in the second game.\n   - Therefore, Sasha scored \\( 10 - 6 = 4 \\) points.\n\nNow, we sum up the points scored by Sasha in both games:\n\\[ 14 \\text{ (first game)} + 4 \\text{ (second game)} = 18 \\text{ points} \\]\n\nThus, the total points scored by Sasha during both games is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
    "answer": "In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points, and Julie scored four fewer points: 14-4 = <<14-4=10>>10 points.\nIn the second game, Sasha scored 6 points fewer than Julie's score in the first game, meaning she scored 10-6=<<10-6=4>>4 points.\nSasha scored 10+4=<<10+4=14>>14 points in the two games.\n#### 14"
