    "question": "The basketball team went to the steakhouse to eat dinner.  The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.  The second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size.  The third player ate a one-pound steak.  And the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals.  In total, how many ounces of meat were consumed by the team?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the amount of meat each player ate and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. **First Player:**\n   - The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.\n   - Each steak contains 1 ounce of meat.\n   - Therefore, the first player ate \\(6 \\text{ ounces} \\times 1 \\text{ ounce/steak} = 6 \\text{ ounces of meat}\\).\n\n2. **Second Player:**\n   - The second player ate beef tips, which contain 8 beef tips.\n   - Each beef tip is 1 ounce.\n   - Therefore, the second player ate \\(8 \\text{ beef tips} \\times 1 \\text{ ounce/beef tip} = 8 \\text{ ounces of meat}\\).\n\n3. **Third Player:**\n   - The third player ate a one-pound steak.\n   - One pound is equal to 16 ounces.\n   - Therefore, the third player ate \\(1 \\text{ pound} \\times 16 \\text{ ounces/pound} = 16 \\text{ ounces of meat}\\).\n\n4. **Fourth and Fifth Players:**\n   - The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not eat any meat.\n   - Therefore, the fourth and fifth players did not eat any meat.\n\nNow, we sum the amounts of meat consumed by each player:\n\\[6 \\text{ ounces} + 8 \\text{ ounces} + 16 \\text{ ounces} = 30 \\text{ ounces}\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is \\(\\boxed{30}\\) ounces.",
    "answer": "The second player consumed 8 1-ounce beef tips, for a total weight of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 ounces.\nThus, the total combined weight includes 6 ounces from the first player, 8 ounces from the second player, and 1 pound, which is 16 ounces, from the third player, for a combined total of 6+8+16=<<6+8+16=30>>30 ounces.\n#### 30"
