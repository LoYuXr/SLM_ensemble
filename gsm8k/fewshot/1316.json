    "question": "Mark's car breaks down and he needs to get a new radiator.  The cost for a new radiator is $400 but he goes to get it at a junk shop and gets it for 80% off.  He then hires a mechanic to install it and it takes 3 hours at $50 an hour.  How much did he pay?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost Mark paid, we need to break down the expenses step by step.\n\n1. **Cost of the new radiator:**\n   The original cost of the radiator is $400.\n\n2. **Discount on the radiator:**\n   The radiator is being sold at a 80% discount. To find the discounted price, we calculate 80% of $400:\n   \\[\n   0.80 \\times 400 = 320\n   \\]\n   So, the discounted price of the radiator is $320.\n\n3. **Cost of hiring the mechanic:**\n   The mechanic charges $50 per hour. To find the total cost for 3 hours, we multiply the hourly rate by 3:\n   \\[\n   50 \\times 3 = 150\n   \\]\n   So, the cost of hiring the mechanic is $150.\n\n4. **Total cost:**\n   To find the total cost, we add the discounted price of the radiator to the cost of hiring the mechanic:\n   \\[\n   320 + 150 = 470\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Mark paid is \\(\\boxed{470}\\).",
    "answer": "The discount on the radiator was 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320\nSo he paid 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80\nThe mechanic charges 3*50=$<<3*50=150>>150\nSo in total he paid 80+150=$<<80+150=230>>230\n#### 230"
