    "question": "Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year. Butler High School, the neighboring school, enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. How much greater is the average enrollment at Norman High School than the enrollment at Butler High School?",
    "completion": "To determine how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.\n2. Subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.\n\nFirst, let's find the average enrollment at Butler High School. The problem states that Butler High School enrolls an average of \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) as many students as Norman High School. The enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students. Therefore, the average enrollment at Butler High School is:\n\\[\n\\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 4000\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \\frac{3 \\times 4000}{4} = \\frac{12000}{4} = 3000\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and the average enrollment at Butler High School:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \\text{Enrollment at Butler High School}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000\n\\]\n\nThus, the average enrollment at Norman High School is \\(\\boxed{1000}\\) students greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School.",
    "answer": "If Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year, Butler High School school enrolls an average of 3/4*4000 =<<4000*3/4=3000>>3000 students every year.\nThe average enrollment at Norman High School is greater than the enrollment at Butler High School by 4000-3000= <<4000-3000=1000>>1000\n#### 1000"
