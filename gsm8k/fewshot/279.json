    "question": "Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. How old is Sam now?",
    "completion": "Let's denote Sam's current age as \\( S \\) and Ruby's current age as \\( R \\). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:\n\n1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.\n2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.\n\nWe can translate these statements into mathematical equations.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have:\n\\[ R = 6S \\]\n\nFrom the second statement, we have:\n\\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \\]\n\nNow, let's substitute \\( R = 6S \\) into the second equation:\n\\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \\]\n\nNext, we expand and simplify the equation:\n\\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \\]\n\nSubtract \\( 3S \\) from both sides:\n\\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \\]\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n\\[ 3S = 18 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\\[ S = 6 \\]\n\nSo, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, we can calculate Ruby's age:\n\\[ R = 6S = 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\]\n\nIn 9 years, Sam will be:\n\\[ S + 9 = 6 + 9 = 15 \\]\n\nAnd Ruby will be:\n\\[ R + 9 = 36 + 9 = 45 \\]\n\nIndeed, 15 is 3 times 45, confirming our solution is correct. Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.",
    "answer": "Let x be Sam's age and Y be Ruby's age. Ruby's age is currently 6 times Sam's age, so 6 * x = Y years.\nIn 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.\nTo find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.\nWe distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.\nWe isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).\nWe simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.\nNow we know that Sam's age is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 years.\n#### 6"
