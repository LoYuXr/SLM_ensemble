    "question": "The Science Center hosted field trips Monday through Friday last week. On Monday, 32 classes visited. Twice as many visited on Tuesday and three times as many visited on Wednesday. Another 30 classes visited on Thursday and 25 visited on Friday. In all, how many classes visited the Science Center last week?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then sum these numbers.\n\n1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.\n2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many classes as Monday, so \\(2 \\times 32 = 64\\) classes visited.\n3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many classes as Monday, so \\(3 \\times 32 = 96\\) classes visited.\n4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.\n5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.\n\nNow, we sum the number of classes that visited each day:\n\\[\n32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25\n\\]\n\nLet's add these step by step:\n\\[\n32 + 64 = 96\n\\]\n\\[\n96 + 96 = 192\n\\]\n\\[\n192 + 30 = 222\n\\]\n\\[\n222 + 25 = 247\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is \\(\\boxed{247}\\).",
    "answer": "On Tuesday, 32 classes x 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 classes visited.\nOn Wednesday, 32 classes x 3 = <<32*3=96>>96 classes visited.\nIn all, last week 32 classes on Monday + 64 on Tuesday + 96 on Wednesday + 30 on Thursday + 25 on Friday = <<32+64+96+30+25=247>>247 classes visited the Science Center last week.\n#### 247"
