    "question": "Generally, a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, a 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, and then a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits. How many total fruits can an avocado tree produce during its 10 years of life?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced by each age group over the 10-year period and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of fruits produced by a 5-year-old tree:**\n   - Initial number of fruits: 50\n   - Number of fruits produced in the 5th year: \\(50 \\times 3 = 150\\)\n\n2. **Calculate the number of fruits produced by a 6-year-old tree:**\n   - Initial number of fruits: 50\n   - Number of fruits produced in the 6th year: \\(50 \\times 3 = 150\\)\n\n3. **Calculate the number of fruits produced by a 7-year-old tree:**\n   - Initial number of fruits: 50\n   - Number of fruits produced in the 7th year: \\(50 \\times 3 = 150\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the number of fruits produced by a 8-year-old tree:**\n   - Initial number of fruits: 50\n   - Number of fruits produced in the 8th year: \\(50 \\times 3 = 150\\)\n\n5. **Calculate the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree:**\n   - Initial number of fruits: 50\n   - Number of fruits produced in the 10th year: \\(50 \\times 20 = 1000\\)\n\n6. **Calculate the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree in the ninth year:**\n   - Number of fruits produced in the 9th year: \\(50 \\times 20 = 1000\\)\n\nNow, sum the fruits produced by all the trees over the 10 years:\n\n\\[\n150 + 150 + 150 + 150 + 150 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 150 + 150 + 150 + 150 + 150 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 100",
    "answer": "At 5 years it produces 50 fruits\nAt 6 years it produces 50 * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 fruits.\nAt 7 years, it produces 50 * 7 = <<50*7=350>>350 fruits\nAt 10 years, it produces 50 * 20 = <<50*20=1000>>1000 fruits\nAt 8 years, it produces 200 fewer fruits than at 10 years, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits\nDuring 10 years, an avocado tree can produce a total of 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = <<50+150+350+800+1000=2350>>2350 fruits\n#### 2350"
