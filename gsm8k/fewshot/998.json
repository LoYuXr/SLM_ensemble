    "question": "Dylan attended a wedding where there were 100 guests in the reception. Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you for helping in the wedding reception. If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, how many people were in the church next door?",
    "completion": "To determine how many people were in the church next door, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cookies brought by all the guests.\n2. Determine how many cookies were given to the church next door.\n3. Calculate the number of people in the church next door.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of cookies brought by all the guests. There are 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies:\n\\[\n100 \\text{ guests} \\times 15 \\text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \\text{ cookies}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how many cookies were given to the church next door. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1500 \\text{ cookies} = 750 \\text{ cookies}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of people in the church next door. Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, so the number of people is:\n\\[\n\\frac{750 \\text{ cookies}}{15 \\text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \\text{ people}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of people in the church next door is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
    "answer": "If each of the 100 guests brought a plate of 15 cookies, then the total number of cookies brought is 100*15 = <<100*15=1500>>1500 cookies.\nIf the next church was given 1/2 the number of cookies, then they got 1/2*1500 = <<1/2*1500=750>>750 cookies.\nIf each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, then there were 750/15 = <<750/15=50>>50 people.\n#### 50"
