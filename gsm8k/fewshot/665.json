    "question": "Out of the 150 teachers on the school basketball court, 60% are history teachers. If the rest of the teachers on the court are math teachers, and each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, calculate the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day.",
    "completion": "To determine the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of history teachers on the school basketball court.\n2. Determine the number of math teachers on the school basketball court.\n3. Calculate the total number of hours the math teachers sleep in one day.\n4. Convert the total number of hours into days.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of history teachers.**\n\nThe total number of teachers on the school basketball court is 150. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, we can calculate the number of history teachers as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of history teachers} = 150 \\times 0.60 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of math teachers.**\n\nThe number of math teachers is the total number of teachers minus the number of history teachers:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours the math teachers sleep in one day.**\n\nEach teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total number of hours the math teachers sleep in one day is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total hours of sleep} = 60 \\times 6 = 360 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Convert the total number of hours into days.**\n\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of days the math teachers sleep in one day is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total days of sleep} = \\frac{360 \\text{ hours}}{24 \\text{ hours/day}} = 15 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \\boxed{15} days.",
    "answer": "The total number of teachers in the basketball court who teaches history is 60/100*150 = <<60/100*150=90>>90\nThis means there are 150-90 = <<150-90=60>>60 math teachers are on the basketball court.\nIf each teacher sleeps for 6 hours daily, the total amount of time the math teachers sleep in a day is 60*6 = <<60*6=360>>360 hours.\n#### 360"
