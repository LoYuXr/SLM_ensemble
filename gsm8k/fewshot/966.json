    "question": "Greta wanted brownies for her birthday.  She made a batch for herself; one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.  At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.  During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.  How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?",
    "completion": "To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of brownies Greta initially made.\n2. Determine the total number of brownies given to her friends.\n3. Subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party from the total number of brownies given to her friends.\n4. Add the remaining brownies to the initial number of brownies to find the total number of brownies left over.\n\nLet's start with the initial number of brownies Greta made:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ dozen} = 12 \\text{ brownies} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of brownies given to her friends:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ dozen} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\text{ brownies} \\]\n\nThen, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ brownies} - 1 \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ dozen} = 6 - 6 = 0 \\text{ brownies} \\]\n\nSince 1 1/2 dozen is equivalent to 6 brownies, we can confirm that the number of brownies eaten is indeed 6.\n\nFinally, we add the remaining brownies to the initial number of brownies to find the total number of brownies left over:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ initial brownies} + 0 \\text{ brownies eaten} = 12 \\text{ brownies} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of brownies left over from the entire day is:\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]",
    "answer": "Her office sent her home with a 1/2 dozen brownies so she had 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 individual brownies\nHer friends had 4 dozen brownies and 1 1/2 dozen were eaten so 4-1.5 = <<4-1.5=2.5>>2.5 dozen brownies left\nShe made 1 dozen brownies and had 2.5 dozen left from the party so 1+2.5 = <<1+2.5=3.5>>3.5 dozen brownies\nEvery dozen is 12 and she has 3.5 dozen so she has 12*3.5 = <<12*3.5=42>>42 individuals brownies\nShe has 42 individual brownies plus the 6 individual brownies sent home from work so she has a total of 42+6 = <<42+6=48>>48 individual brownies\n#### 48"
