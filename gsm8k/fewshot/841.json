    "question": "Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800. Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200 to help him. How much money does he still need?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and then subtract that from the cost of the car and the phone.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Gabriel has:\n1. Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends.\n2. Gabriel's brother gave him $200.\n3. Therefore, the total amount of money Gabriel has is:\n   \\[\n   5000 + 200 = 5200\n   \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:\n1. The cost of the car is $10000.\n2. The cost of the phone is $800.\n3. Therefore, the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   10000 + 800 = 10800\n   \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total cost from the total amount of money Gabriel has to find out how much money he still needs:\n\\[\n5200 - 10800 = -5600\n\\]\n\nSince the result is negative, it means Gabriel does not have enough money to buy both the car and the phone. He is short by $5600.\n\nThus, the amount of money Gabriel still needs is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-5600}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The amount of purchases Gabriel wants to make is $10000 + $800 = $<<10000+800=10800>>10800.\nAnd Gabriel has $5000 + $200 = $<<5000+200=5200>>5200.\nSo, Gabriel still needs $10800 - $5200 = $<<10800-5200=5600>>5600.\n#### 5600"
