    "question": "The expenditure of Joseph in May was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less. How much was his total expenditure for those two months?",
    "completion": "To determine Joseph's total expenditure for the two months of May and June, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the expenditure in May.\n2. Calculate the expenditure in June.\n3. Add the expenditure in May and June to find the total expenditure.\n\nStep 1: Identify the expenditure in May.\nThe expenditure in May was $500.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expenditure in June.\nThe expenditure in June was $60 less than in May. Therefore, we subtract $60 from the May expenditure:\n\\[ 500 - 60 = 440 \\]\nSo, the expenditure in June was $440.\n\nStep 3: Add the expenditure in May and June to find the total expenditure.\n\\[ 500 + 440 = 940 \\]\n\nThus, the total expenditure for the two months is \\(\\boxed{940}\\).",
    "answer": "His expenditure in June was $500 - $60 = $<<500-60=440>>440.\nHis total expenditure for May and June was $500 + $440 = $<<500+440=940>>940.\n#### 940"
