    "question": "Mack wants to count things and decided to count how many birds there are in the sky over the next week. On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds. On day three he saw none. On days four and five, he saw 120 birds. On day six he saw 20 and on day seven he saw 90. On average, how many birds did Mack see in a day?",
    "completion": "To determine the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of birds seen over the week:**\n   - On days one and two, Mack saw 50 birds each day.\n   - On days three through seven, Mack saw 120 birds each day.\n\n   First, calculate the total number of birds seen from days one to two:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ birds/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 100 \\text{ birds}\n   \\]\n\n   Next, calculate the total number of birds seen from days three to seven:\n   \\[\n   120 \\text{ birds/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 600 \\text{ birds}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, add the two totals to find the overall total number of birds seen:\n   \\[\n   100 \\text{ birds} + 600 \\text{ birds} = 700 \\text{ birds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the average number of birds seen per day:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of birds}}{\\text{Number of days}} = \\frac{700 \\text{ birds}}{7 \\text{ days}}\n   \\]\n\n   Perform the division:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{700}{7} = 100\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average number of birds Mack saw in a day is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
    "answer": "On days one to three, Mack saw 50+0=<<50+0=50>>50 birds.\nOn days four to seven, he saw 120+20+90=<<120+20+90=230>>230 birds.\nFor the whole week he saw 230+50=<<230+50=280>>280 birds.\nOn average Mack saw 280/7=<<280/7=40>>40 birds a day.\n#### 40"
