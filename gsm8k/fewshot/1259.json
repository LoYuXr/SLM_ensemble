    "question": "Derrick has a bakery that makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, selling at $2 per doughnut. How much money does Derrick make in June if he sells all the doughnuts?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of doughnuts made in June.\n2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many doughnuts Derrick makes in June. June has 30 days, so the number of doughnuts made in June is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ dozen} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 300 \\text{ doughnuts} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts. Each doughnut is sold for $2, so the total revenue is:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ doughnuts} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per doughnut} = 600 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is:\n\\[ \\boxed{600} \\]",
    "answer": "A dozen doughnuts have 12 doughnuts, and if Derrick makes 10 dozen in a day, the total number of doughnuts he makes is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts.\nSince each doughnut sells at $2 per piece, Derrick makes 120*$2 = $<<120*2=240>>240 per day from selling his doughnuts.\nIn June, with 30 days, after making and selling the doughnuts every day, Derrick makes $240*30 = $<<30*240=7200>>7200\n#### 7200"
