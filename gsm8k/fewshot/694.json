    "question": "Tomorrow, 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending a function at Mia\u2019s restaurant. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. If there are 8 high chairs, how many more chairs does she have to get?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of regular chairs.\n2. Determine the total number of chairs needed.\n3. Subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number needed.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Since there are 15 babies, the number of high chairs is 15. Therefore, the number of regular chairs is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 15 = 75 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of chairs needed. The total number of chairs is the sum of the regular chairs and the high chairs:\n\\[ 75 + 15 = 90 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more chairs are needed. The restaurant has 42 adults and 15 babies, which totals to:\n\\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \\]\n\nThe number of additional chairs needed is the total number of chairs needed minus the number of chairs currently available:\n\\[ 90 - 57 = 33 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mia needs to get \\(\\boxed{33}\\) more chairs.",
    "answer": "Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = <<8*5=40>>40 regular chairs\nThe total number of both types of chairs is therefore 8 + 40 = <<8+40=48>>48 chairs\nHowever, the total number of attendants will be 42 + 15 = <<42+15=57>>57 people\nMia will therefore need 57-48 = <<57-48=9>>9 more chairs\n#### 9"
