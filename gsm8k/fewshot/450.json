    "answer": "The super ticket costs $20 and for $1 extra I can get a popcorn and a soda, there I'd pay in total $20+$1 = $<<20+1=21>>21\nIf I didn't buy the ($21) super ticket but bought everything included on it and still saved $2, then I spent in total $21-$2 = $<<21-2=19>>19\nIf the regular movie ticket costs $12 and the soda costs $3 then the popcorn would cost $19-$12-$3=$4\n#### 4"
