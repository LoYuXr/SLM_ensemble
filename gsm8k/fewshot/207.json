    "question": "Joe's bag of Halloween candy has 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. If each chocolate bar weighs 40g, how much does Joe's bag of candy weigh, in grams?",
    "completion": "To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the weight of each candied apple:**\n   Each candied apple weighs 40 grams.\n\n2. **Determine the number of candied apples:**\n   Joe has 80 candied apples.\n\n3. **Calculate the total weight of the candied apples:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \\text{ apples} \\times 40 \\text{ grams/apple} = 3200 \\text{ grams}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:**\n   Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, and there are 25 chocolate bars.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \\text{ bars} \\times 40 \\text{ grams/bar} = 1000 \\text{ grams}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total weight of all the candy:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight of candy} = \\text{Total weight of candied apples} + \\text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 3200 \\text{ grams} + 1000 \\text{ grams} = 4200 \\text{ grams}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is \\(\\boxed{4200}\\) grams.",
    "answer": "The candied apples weigh 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 grams each.\nThe chocolate bars weigh 40*25=<<40*25=1000>>1000 grams in total.\nThe candied apples weigh 20*80=<<20*80=1600>>1600 grams in total.\nJoe's bag weighs 1000+1600=<<1000+1600=2600>>2600 grams.\n#### 2600"
