    "question": "Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid $7 in all, how many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total amount paid:**\n   The total amount paid by Suzie is $7.\n\n2. **Identify the total number of packs of gum:**\n   Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.\n\n3. **Identify the cost of the strawberry gum:**\n   Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, so the cost of the strawberry gum is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ packs} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per pack} = \\$4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the cost of the green apple gum:**\n   The green apple gum is half the price of the strawberry gum. Therefore, the cost of the green apple gum is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$4}{2} = \\$2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total cost of the green apple gum:**\n   The total cost of the green apple gum is the sum of the cost of the strawberry gum and the green apple gum:\n   \\[\n   \\$4 + \\$2 = \\$6\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the number of packs of green apple gum:**\n   Since Suzie bought two packs of green apple gum, the number of packs is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$6}{\\$2 \\text{ per pack}} = 3 \\text{ packs}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the cost per pack of green apple gum:**\n   The cost per pack of green apple gum is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$6}{3 \\text{ packs}} = \\$2 \\text{ per pack}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "The green apple gum cost half as much as the $2 grape gum, so it cost 2 / 2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.\nThus, the two packs of strawberry gum cost 7 - 2 - 1 = $<<7-2-1=4>>4.\nTherefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost 4 / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.\n#### 2"
