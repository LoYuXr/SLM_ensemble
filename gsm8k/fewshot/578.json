    "question": "Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5 and the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. What was the final value of the number train?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the number train as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the starting value of the number train is 20. The starting value plus half the number is \\( 20 + \\frac{x}{2} \\). This value is then divided by 5, and the resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{20 + \\frac{x}{2}}{5} \\right) \\left( 20 - 12 \\right) = 20 + \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]\n\nFirst, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20 + \\frac{x}{2}}{5} = \\frac{40 + x}{10}\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the product of the two terms:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{40 + x}{10} \\right) \\left( 8 \\right) = 20 + \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, simplify the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{40 + x}{10} \\cdot 8 = 20 + \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 10 to clear the denominator:\n\n\\[\n40 + x = 20 + 5x\n\\]\n\nNext, isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting \\( x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n40 = 20 + 4x\n\\]\n\nThen, subtract 20 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n20 = 4x\n\\]\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\nx = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, the final value of the number train is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
    "answer": "If Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20, half the number is 1/2*20=<<20-10=10>>10\nThe starting value plus half the number is 20+10=<<20+10=30>>30\nThis starting value plus half the number was divided by 5, giving a total of 30/5 = <<30/5=6>>6\nThe starting value minus 12 is 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8\nThe resulting value after dividing by 5 was times by the starting value minus 12, a total of 8*6 = <<8*6=48>>48\n#### 48"
