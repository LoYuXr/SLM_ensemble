    "question": "Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas. Each pizza had 8 slices. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did. Silvia ate twice as many slices than Jake did. If Becky ate 10 slices, how many total slices did they eat?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of slices each person ate:**\n   - Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas.\n   - Total slices from 4 pizzas: \\( 4 \\times 8 = 32 \\) slices.\n\n2. **Determine the number of slices each person ate:**\n   - Becky ate 10 slices.\n   - Let \\( J \\) be the number of slices Jake ate.\n   - Let \\( S \\) be the number of slices Silvia ate.\n   - According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake:\n     \\[\n     J = S + 3\n     \\]\n   - The total number of slices eaten by all three is 32:\n     \\[\n     J + S + 10 = 32\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute \\( J \\) in terms of \\( S \\) into the total equation:**\n   \\[\n   (S + 3) + S + 10 = 32\n   \\]\n   Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   2S + 13 = 32\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( S \\):**\n   \\[\n   2S = 32 - 13\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2S = 19\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{19}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S = 9.5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find \\( J \\) and \\( S \\):**\n   - \\( J = S + 3 = 9.5 + 3 = 12.5 \\)\n   - \\( S = 9.5 \\)\n\n6. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by all three:**\n   \\[\n   J + S + 10 = 12.5 + 9.5 + 10 = 32\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
    "answer": "Jake ate 10-3 = <<10-3=7>>7 slices of pizza.\nSilvia ate 7*2 = <<7*2=14>>14 slices of pizza.\nJake, Silvia, and Becky ate 10+7+14 = <<10+7+14=31>>31 slices all together.\n#### 31"
