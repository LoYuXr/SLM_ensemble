    "question": "Tim decides to cancel his cable subscription and get streaming services.  He gets Netflix for $10 a month.  Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 a month each but he saves 20% for bundling.  How much money does he save by cancelling his $60 cable package?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package, we need to calculate the total cost of the cable package with streaming services and then compare it to the cost of the cancelled package.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the cancelled cable package:\n- The cancelled cable package costs $60.\n- Netflix for $10 a month.\n- Hulu and Disney Plus for $10 each, but he saves 20% on the bundled packages.\n\nThe cost of the bundled packages is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ (Netflix)} + 10 \\text{ (Hulu and Disney Plus)} = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince he saves 20% on the bundled packages, the savings per month are:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ dollars} \\times 0.20 = 4 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the cancelled cable package with streaming services:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ dollars} + 4 \\text{ dollars} = 64 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package is:\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]",
    "answer": "Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost 10+10=$<<10+10=20>>20\nBy bundling he saves 20*.2=$<<20*.2=4>>4\nSo in total it cost 20-4=$<<20-4=16>>16\nSo he pays 16+10=$<<16+10=26>>26 for streaming\nThat means he saves 60-26=$<<60-26=34>>34 a month\n#### 34"
