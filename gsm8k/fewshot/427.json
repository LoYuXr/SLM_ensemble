    "question": "Kenny is selling his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park, which costs $100. He has a collection of cards and plans to sell them for $1.5 each. He keeps 1/3 of them and gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash. How many cards did he start with?",
    "completion": "To determine how many cards Kenny started with, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny has:**\n   Kenny has $50 in spending cash.\n\n2. **Determine how much money Kenny gets to spend on the amusement park:**\n   Kenny gets to go to the amusement park with $50, so he has $50 - $50 = $0 left after buying the tickets.\n\n3. **Calculate how much money Kenny spends on the tickets:**\n   The tickets cost $100, and Kenny has $0 left after buying the tickets. Therefore, he spends $100 - $0 = $100 on the tickets.\n\n4. **Determine how many cards Kenny sells to get $100:**\n   Kenny sells each card for $1.5. To find out how many cards he needs to sell to get $100, we divide $100 by $1.5:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{100}{1.5} = \\frac{100 \\times 2}{1.5 \\times 2} = \\frac{200}{3} \\approx 66.67\n   \\]\n   Since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, he needs to sell 67 cards to get $100.\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of cards Kenny has:**\n   Kenny has 67 cards and he sells 67 cards to get $100. Therefore, the total number of cards he has is:\n   \\[\n   67 + 67 = 134\n   \\]\n\nSo, Kenny started with \\(\\boxed{134}\\) cards.",
    "answer": "He made $150 selling the cards because 100 + 50 = <<100+50=150>>150\nHe sold 100 cards because 150 / 1.5 = <<150/1.5=100>>100\nThe cards he sold were 2/3 of his collection because 1 - (1/3) = 2/3\nHe started with 150 cards because 100 / (2/3) = <<100/(2/3)=150>>150\n#### 150"
