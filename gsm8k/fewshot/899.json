    "question": "Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas and was going to equally divide them between her 6 nephews. Before Susan could package them, her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself. How many cookies will each of Susan\u2019s nephews get?",
    "completion": "To determine how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Susan initially had:**\n   Susan made 100 cookies.\n\n2. **Determine the number of cookies Susan had left after her husband snuck 4 cookies:**\n   Susan initially had 100 cookies, and her husband snuck 4 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies left is:\n   \\[\n   100 - 4 = 96\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide the remaining cookies equally among her 6 nephews:**\n   To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{96}{6} = 16\n   \\]\n\nThus, each of Susan's nephews will get \\(\\boxed{16}\\) cookies.",
    "answer": "Subtract 4 from 100 to see how many cookies are left. 100 cookies - 4 cookies = <<100-4=96>>96 cookies\nDivide 96 cookies between her 6 nephews = 96 cookies/6 people = <<96/6=16>>16 cookies/person\n#### 16"
