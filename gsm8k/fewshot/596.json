    "question": "George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He\u2019s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?",
    "completion": "To determine how many hours George needs to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and then figure out how much he needs to earn from his hourly wage to cover that cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the implants:\n- Each implant costs $2000.\n- George needs 2 implants.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of implants} = 2 \\times 2000 = 4000 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the cost of the crown:\n- The crown costs an extra $500.\n- The total cost of the crown is $500.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of implants and crown} = 4000 + 500 = 4500 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nGeorge already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to earn is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining amount to earn} = 4500 - 600 = 3900 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nGeorge earns $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of hours needed} = \\frac{3900}{15} = 260 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, George needs to work \\boxed{260} hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work.",
    "answer": "The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.\nAdding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.\nSubtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.\nThis means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.\n#### 260"
