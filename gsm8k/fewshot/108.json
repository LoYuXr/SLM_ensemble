    "question": "Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, Henry baked twice as many cookies last year as he did this year. Therefore, the number of cookies he baked this year is \\( 2x \\).\n\nHenry realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so the number of cookies he actually baked is \\( 2x + 15 \\).\n\nAfter dropping 5 cookies, the number of cookies left is \\( (2x + 15) - 5 \\).\n\nWe know that after dropping the cookies, Henry has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n(2x + 15) - 5 = 110\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[\n2x + 10 = 110\n\\]\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2x = 100\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = 50\n\\]\n\nSo, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.",
    "answer": "Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.\nHe had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 \u2013 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year\u2019s amount.\nTherefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.\n#### 50"
