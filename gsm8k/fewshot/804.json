    "question": "Two cars are driving on a highway.  The first car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour when the second car passes it at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.  If both cars continue on the highway at the same speed, how many miles will separate them after 2 hours?",
    "completion": "To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between these distances.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:\n- The first car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.\n- The time it takes for the first car to travel 2 hours is \\(2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ miles/hour} = 120 \\text{ miles}\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:\n- The second car is traveling at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.\n- The time it takes for the second car to travel 2 hours is \\(2 \\text{ hours} \\times 70 \\text{ miles/hour} = 140 \\text{ miles}\\).\n\nNow, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:\n- The first car travels 120 miles.\n- The second car travels 140 miles.\n- The distance separated by the two cars after 2 hours is \\(140 \\text{ miles} - 120 \\text{ miles} = 20 \\text{ miles}\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of miles that will separate the two cars after 2 hours is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
    "answer": "In two hours, the first car will have traveled 60*2 = <<60*2=120>>120 miles.\nSimilarly, the second car will have traveled 70*2 = <<70*2=140>>140 miles.\nThus, the cars are separated by 140 - 120 = <<140-120=20>>20 miles after two hours.\n#### 20"
