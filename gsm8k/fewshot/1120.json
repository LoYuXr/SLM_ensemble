    "question": "John visits his parents twice a month.  It takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph.  Considering the round trip, how many miles a month does he drive when visiting his parents?",
    "completion": "To determine how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to consider both the round trip and the one-way trip.\n\n1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**\n   - John visits his parents twice a month.\n   - It takes him 2 hours to drive there.\n   - The speed is 70 mph.\n   - Therefore, the one-way distance is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{One-way distance} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{2 \\text{ hours}}{70 \\text{ mph}} = \\frac{2}{70} \\text{ miles} = \\frac{1}{35} \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**\n   - The round trip distance is twice the one-way distance.\n   - Therefore, the round trip distance is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Round trip distance} = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{35} \\text{ miles} = \\frac{2}{35} \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total monthly driving distance:**\n   - John visits his parents twice a month.\n   - Therefore, the total monthly driving distance is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total monthly driving distance} = 2 \\times \\frac{2}{35} \\text{ miles} = \\frac{4}{35} \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\nThus, John drives \\(\\frac{4}{35}\\) miles a month when visiting his parents.",
    "answer": "His parents live 70*2=<<70*2=140>>140 miles away\nSo he drives 140*2=<<140*2=280>>280 miles a round trip\n280*2 = <<280*2=560>>560 miles a month\n#### 560"
