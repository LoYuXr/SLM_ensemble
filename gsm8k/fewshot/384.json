    "question": "Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. How much land did he have at first?",
    "completion": "To determine how much land Mr. Ruther had initially, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.\n2. According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of his land. This means he sold \\( \\frac{3}{5}x \\) hectares.\n3. After selling \\(\\frac{3}{5}x\\) hectares, he had 12.8 hectares left. Therefore, the amount of land he had initially is the sum of the land he sold and the land he had left:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{3}{5}x + 12.8\n   \\]\n4. To isolate \\( x \\), we first subtract \\(\\frac{3}{5}x\\) from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   x - \\frac{3}{5}x = 12.8\n   \\]\n5. Simplify the left side of the equation by finding a common denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{5}x - \\frac{3}{5}x = 12.8\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8\n   \\]\n6. To solve for \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\):\n   \\[\n   x = 12.8 \\times \\frac{5}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 64\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially is \\(\\boxed{64}\\) hectares.",
    "answer": "Mr. Ruther is left with 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land.\nSince 2/5 is equal to 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 is equal to 12.8/2 = <<12.8/2=6.4>>6.4 hectares.\nHence, Mr. Ruther had 6.4 x 5 = <<6.4*5=32>>32 hectares of land at first.\n#### 32"
