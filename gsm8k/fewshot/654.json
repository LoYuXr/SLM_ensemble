    "question": "Lori needed 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves.  She anticipates that each of her guests will eat 3 deviled egg halves.  If she is inviting 16 guests to her party, how many dozens of eggs will she need?",
    "completion": "To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves Lori will serve.\n2. Determine the total number of eggs needed.\n3. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.\n\nFirst, we know that each egg is a whole egg, so each egg contains 1 egg. Therefore, 1 whole egg is equivalent to 1 egg. Since Lori anticipates that each of her guests will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves is:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ guests} \\times 3 \\text{ deviled egg halves per guest} = 48 \\text{ deviled egg halves} \\]\n\nSince each egg contains 1 egg, the total number of eggs needed is 48. Next, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so the total number of dozens of eggs needed is:\n\\[ \\frac{48 \\text{ eggs}}{12 \\text{ eggs per dozen}} = 4 \\text{ dozens} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of dozens of eggs Lori will need is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]",
    "answer": "She is inviting 16 guests that will eat 3 deviled egg halves each so she needs 16*3 =<<16*3=48>>48 halves\n1 whole egg is needed to make 2 halves so 48 halves is 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 whole eggs\n1 dozen is equal to 12 and she needs 24 eggs so she needs 24/12 = <<24/12=2>>2 dozen eggs\n#### 2"
