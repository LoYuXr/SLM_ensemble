    "question": "A company sold 4000 gallons of milk in jars to Mr. Marcellus' store at the cost of $3.5 per gallon. However, Mr. Marcellus later realized 2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased had passed the expiry date and could not be sold. He returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund. Calculate how much he got in refunds.",
    "completion": "To determine how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of milk sold to Mr. Marcellus.\n2. Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date.\n3. Calculate the amount of milk that could be sold after accounting for the expired milk.\n4. Determine the refund amount based on the amount of milk sold and the refund policy.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of milk sold to Mr. Marcellus.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total milk sold} = 4000 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Milk that passed the expiry date} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 4000 = \\frac{2 \\times 4000}{5} = \\frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the amount of milk that could be sold after accounting for the expired milk.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Milk that could be sold} = 4000 - 1600 = 2400 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n4. Determine the refund amount based on the amount of milk sold and the refund policy.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Refund amount} = 2400 \\text{ gallons} \\times 3.5 \\text{ dollars/gallon} = 8400 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is \\(\\boxed{8400}\\).",
    "answer": "If he purchased 4000 gallons, the number of gallons expired is 2/5 * 4000 gallons = <<2/5*4000=1600>>1600 gallons.\nIf each gallon costs $3.5, and he returned 1600 gallons for refund, the total amount he got from the refund is $3.5/gallon * 1600 gallons = $<<3.5*1600=5600>>5600\n#### 5600"
