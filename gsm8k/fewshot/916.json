    "question": "Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance by their mother. The two girls decided to combine their allowance to surprise their father on his birthday. They bought a cake which costs $11. They also bought 1 dozen balloons which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons. The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?",
    "completion": "To determine how much allowance each girl received, we need to calculate the total amount spent and then divide it by the number of girls.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the items bought by Julia and Nadine:\n1. The cost of the cake is $11.\n2. The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons, which is $0.5 \\times 2 = $1.\n3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 each, which is $7 \\times 2 = $14.\n\nAdding these amounts together gives the total cost:\n\\[ 11 + 1 + 14 = 26 \\]\n\nSince they combined their allowances to surprise their father, the total amount of money they had is $26. Since they are divided equally between Julia and Nadine, each of them received:\n\\[ \\frac{26}{2} = 13 \\]\n\nTherefore, each girl's mother gave each of them $13.",
    "answer": "There are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pairs of balloons in 1 dozen.\nThe cost for buying a dozen balloons was $0.5 x 6 = $<<0.5*6=3>>3.\nThe cost of 2 tubs of ice cream was $7 x 2 = $<<7*2=14>>14.\nThe total cost of their purchases is $11 + $3 +$14 = $<<11+3+14=28>>28.\nSo their mother gave each of them $28/2 = $<<28/2=14>>14.\n#### 14"
