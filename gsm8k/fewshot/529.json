    "question": "Tom bought a CD for $4, and a headphone set. In total, he paid $48. How many more CDs would Tom have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the CDs and the headphone set.\n2. Subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total cost to find out how much money was left for the CDs.\n3. Determine how many more CDs Tom could buy with the remaining money.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The total cost of the CDs and the headphone set is $48. The cost of the headphone set is $4. So, the total cost of the CDs and the headphone set is:\n\\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money was left for the CDs. Since the total cost of the CDs and the headphone set is $44, the amount of money Tom had initially was:\n\\[ 44 + 4 = 48 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many more CDs Tom could buy with the remaining $48. Since each CD costs $4, the number of additional CDs Tom could buy is:\n\\[ \\frac{48}{4} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy \\(\\boxed{12}\\) more CDs.",
    "answer": "The headphone set cost was 48 - 4 = $<<48-4=44>>44.\nThat means, for that money Tom would be able to buy 44 / 4 = <<44/4=11>>11 more CDs.\n#### 11"
