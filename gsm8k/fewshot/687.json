    "question": "There is one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If their combined ages are 44, how old is one of the twins?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the age of the triplet as \\( T \\) and the age of the twin as \\( T + 7 \\). According to the problem, the combined age of the twins and the triplet is 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ T + (T + 7) = 44 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \\]\n\nNext, we need to isolate \\( T \\). We do this by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2T = 37 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ T = 18.5 \\]\n\nSo, the age of the triplet is 18.5 years. Since the twin is 7 years older than the triplet, the age of the twin is:\n\n\\[ T + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the age of the twin is \\(\\boxed{25.5}\\).",
    "answer": "Let T = age of triplet\nTwin's age = T + <<+7=7>>7\nTwin's combined age = 2 * (T + 7)\nTriplet's combined age = <<3=3>>3T\n2 * (T + 7) + 3T = 44\n2T + 14 + 3T = 44\n5T + 14 = 44\n5T = 30\nT = <<6=6>>6\nTwin = 6 + 7 = <<6+7=13>>13\nThe twins are each <<13=13>>13 years old.\n#### 13"
