    "question": "Lauren is a cartoonist.  She can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.  She was hired for a big project to create 45 large-sized picture scenes, 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 49 small-sized picture scenes.  How many days will it take for her to create all of the picture scenes?",
    "completion": "To determine how many days it will take for Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of picture scenes she can draw in a day and then divide the total number of picture scenes required by the number of picture scenes she can draw per day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of picture scenes Lauren can draw in a day:\n- Large-sized picture scenes: 5\n- Medium-sized picture scenes: 6\n- Small-sized picture scenes: 7\n\nTotal picture scenes per day = 5 + 6 + 7 = 18\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of picture scenes required:\n- Large-sized picture scenes: 45\n- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36\n- Small-sized picture scenes: 49\n\nTotal picture scenes required = 45 + 36 + 49 = 130\n\nNow, we divide the total number of picture scenes required by the number of picture scenes she can draw per day to find out how many days it will take:\n- Days required = Total picture scenes required / Total picture scenes per day\n- Days required = 130 / 18\n\nTo find the exact number of days, we perform the division:\n- Days required = 130 / 18 \u2248 7.22\n\nSince Lauren cannot draw a fraction of a day, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, it will take Lauren 8 days to create all the picture scenes.",
    "answer": "At 5 small-sized picture scenes per day, 45 small-sized scenes will take 45/5 = <<45/5=9>>9 days.\nAt 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, 36 medium-sized scenes will take 36/6 = <<36/6=6>>6 days.\nAt 7 large-sized picture scenes per day, 49 large-sized scenes will take 49/7 = <<49/7=7>>7 days.\nAltogether, the entire project will take 9 + 6 +7 = <<9+6+7=22>>22 days to complete.\n#### 22"
