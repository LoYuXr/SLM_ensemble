    "question": "Cindy's math and science books weigh 2 pounds each.  Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.  Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book.  If Cindy carries all of her books at once, what will be the total weight of the books she is carrying?",
    "completion": "To determine the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to calculate the weight of each type of book and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Weight of Cindy's math and science books:**\n   - Each math and science book weighs 2 pounds.\n   - Cindy has 3 math and science books.\n   - Total weight of math and science books = \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) pounds.\n\n2. **Weight of Cindy's French book:**\n   - The French book weighs 4 pounds.\n\n3. **Weight of Cindy's English book:**\n   - The English book weighs 3 pounds.\n\n4. **Weight of Cindy's history book:**\n   - The history book weighs twice as much as the English book.\n   - Weight of history book = \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) pounds.\n\nNow, we sum up the weights of all the books:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total weight} = \\text{Weight of math and science books} + \\text{Weight of French book} + \\text{Weight of English book} + \\text{Weight of history book}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total weight} = 6 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 19 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total weight of Cindy's books is \\(\\boxed{19}\\) pounds.",
    "answer": "The math and science book weigh 2 pounds each so they weigh 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 pounds\nHer history books weighs twice the amount of her 3 pound English book so it weighs 2*3 = <<2*3=6>>6 pounds\nWhen you add the weight of all of her textbooks together, they weight 4 +4+3+6 = <<4+4+3+6=17>>17 pounds\n#### 17"
