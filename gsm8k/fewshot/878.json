    "question": "Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold 32 glasses of lemonade at their lemonade stand. Julie sold 14 glasses and the boys sold an equal number of glasses. How many more glasses did Julie sell than Micah?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we start by identifying the number of glasses each boy sold. According to the problem, Julie sold 14 glasses and the boys sold an equal number of glasses. Therefore, the number of glasses sold by Micah is also 14.\n\nNext, we need to find the difference between the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah. This can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ 14 - 14 = 0 \\]\n\nThus, Julie sold 0 more glasses than Micah. The final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Micah and Mitchell sold 32 - 14 = <<32-14=18>>18 glasses.\nThey each sold 18/2 = <<18/2=9>>9 glasses.\nJulie sold 14 - 9 = <<14-9=5>>5 glasses more than Micah\n#### 5"
