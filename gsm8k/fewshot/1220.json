    "question": "Ian has a board that is 40 feet long. He decides to make a cut so he can have two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. How long is the longer piece?",
    "completion": "To determine the length of the longer piece of the board, we start by defining the length of the shorter piece as \\( x \\) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. Therefore, the length of the longer piece can be expressed as \\( 4x \\) feet.\n\nThe total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces. We know the total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ x + 4x = 40 \\]\n\nCombining like terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 5x = 40 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\\[ x = \\frac{40}{5} = 8 \\]\n\nSo, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate the length of the longer piece as follows:\n\\[ 4x = 4 \\times 8 = 32 \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of the longer piece is \\(\\boxed{32}\\) feet.",
    "answer": "Let x be the length of the shorter piece.\nThe two pieces are 4x and x in length.\nThe equation is 4x + x = 40 when the lengths of the two boards are added.\nAdding like terms makes the equation 5x = 40.\nThen dividing 40 by 5 gives the value of x which is <<40/5=8>>8.\nSince x =8, the longer piece is 4*8 = 32.\n#### 32"
