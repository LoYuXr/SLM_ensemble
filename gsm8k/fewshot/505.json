    "question": "Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. A 2 x 4 costs $4. A 2 x 8 costs $6. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?",
    "completion": "To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make with the given budget, we need to compare the cost of using each type of wood and then calculate how many popsicle sticks he can get from each type of wood.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of using each type of wood:\n\n1. **Cost of 2 x 4 piece of wood:**\n   - Each 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4.\n   - Frederick has $24 to spend.\n   - Cost of 2 x 4 piece of wood: \\( \\frac{24}{4} = 6 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Cost of 2 x 8 piece of wood:**\n   - Each 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6.\n   - Frederick has $24 to spend.\n   - Cost of 2 x 8 piece of wood: \\( \\frac{24}{6} = 4 \\) dollars.\n\nNext, we compare the cost of each type of wood to determine which one is cheaper:\n\n- Cost of 2 x 4 piece of wood: $6\n- Cost of 2 x 8 piece of wood: $4\n\nSince $6 is less than $4, Frederick should use the 2 x 4 piece of wood to get the most popsicle sticks.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many popsicle sticks Frederick can get from the 2 x 4 piece of wood:\n\n- Each 2 x 4 piece of wood gives 200 popsicle sticks.\n- Number of popsicle sticks from 2 x 4 piece of wood: \\( \\frac{200}{200} = 1 \\) stick.\n\nTherefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make with the given budget is 1 stick.",
    "answer": "He can buy six 2 x 4's because 24 / 4 = <<24/4=6>>6\nHe can make 1200 sticks with this wood because 6 x 200 = <<6*200=1200>>1200\nHe can buy four 2 x 8's because 24 / 6 = <<24/6=4>>4\nHe can make 1600 sticks from this because 4 x 400 = <<4*400=1600>>1600\nHe can make 1600 sticks if he buys the cheapest lumber because 1600 > 1200\n#### 1,600"
