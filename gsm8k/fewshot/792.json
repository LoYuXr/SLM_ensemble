    "question": "Damien created a currency based on bottle caps and got his friends to take part.  He finds 10 bottle caps a day on his way home and each bottle cap is worth $.25.  How much money does he make in a 30 day month?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bottle caps Damien collects in a 30-day month.\n2. Determine the total value of these bottle caps in dollars.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many bottle caps Damien collects in a 30-day month. Since he collects 10 bottle caps each day, we multiply the number of days by the number of bottle caps per day:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ bottle caps/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 300 \\text{ bottle caps} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the total number of bottle caps into dollars. Since each bottle cap is worth $0.25, we multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value per bottle cap:\n\n\\[ 300 \\text{ bottle caps} \\times 0.25 \\text{ dollars/bottle cap} = 75 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{75}\n\\]",
    "answer": "He finds 10*30=<<10*30=300>>300 bottle caps in the month\nThey are worth 300*.25=$<<300*.25=75>>75\n#### 75"
