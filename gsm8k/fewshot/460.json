    "question": "Grayson recycles cans and bottles for money each week. An aluminum can is worth two cents and a plastic bottle is worth three cents. She drinks three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water a week. How many cents does Grayson earn from recycling in a four-week month?",
    "completion": "To determine how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Grayson's weekly earnings from recycling cans and bottles.\n\n1. **Aluminum cans:**\n   - Grayson recycles 3 aluminum cans per week.\n   - Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.\n   - Weekly earnings from aluminum cans: \\( 3 \\text{ cans} \\times 2 \\text{ cents/can} = 6 \\text{ cents} \\).\n\n2. **Plastic bottles:**\n   - Grayson recycles 5 plastic bottles per week.\n   - Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.\n   - Weekly earnings from plastic bottles: \\( 5 \\text{ bottles} \\times 3 \\text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \\text{ cents} \\).\n\nNext, we sum her weekly earnings from both types of recycling:\n\n3. **Total weekly earnings:**\n   - Weekly earnings from cans: 6 cents.\n   - Weekly earnings from bottles: 15 cents.\n   - Total weekly earnings: \\( 6 \\text{ cents} + 15 \\text{ cents} = 21 \\text{ cents} \\).\n\nFinally, we calculate her monthly earnings by multiplying her weekly earnings by 4:\n\n4. **Total monthly earnings:**\n   - Weekly earnings: 21 cents.\n   - Monthly earnings: \\( 21 \\text{ cents/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 84 \\text{ cents/month} \\).\n\nThus, Grayson earns \\(\\boxed{84}\\) cents from recycling in a four-week month.",
    "answer": "Grayson earns 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 cents from soda cans a week.\nShe earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 cents from water bottles a week.\nThus, she earns 6 + 15 = <<6+15=21>>21 cents from recycling each week.\nIn a four week month, she earns 21 * 4 = <<21*4=84>>84 cents from recycling.\n#### 84"
