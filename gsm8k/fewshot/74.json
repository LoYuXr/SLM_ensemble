    "question": "Artie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Artie will make, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of flower and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the revenue from the marigolds:\n- Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds.\n- Each pot of marigolds costs $2.74.\n- Therefore, the revenue from marigolds is:\n  \\[\n  12 \\text{ pots} \\times \\$2.74 \\text{ per pot} = \\$33.68\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue from the petunias:\n- Artie sells 9 pots of petunias.\n- Each pot of petunias costs $1.87.\n- Therefore, the revenue from petunias is:\n  \\[\n  9 \\text{ pots} \\times \\$1.87 \\text{ per pot} = \\$16.83\n  \\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the revenue from the begonias:\n- Artie sells 17 pots of begonias.\n- Each pot of begonias costs $2.12.\n- Therefore, the revenue from begonias is:\n  \\[\n  17 \\text{ pots} \\times \\$2.12 \\text{ per pot} = \\$35.04\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the revenues from all three types of flowers to find the total revenue:\n\\[\n\\$33.68 + \\$16.83 + \\$35.04 = \\$85.55\n\\]\n\nThus, Artie will make \\(\\boxed{85.55}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Artie will round his marigolds up from $2.74 to $3, since the number following the 2 is 5 or higher.\nArtie will round his petunias up from $1.87 to $2, since the number following the 1 is 5 or higher.\nArtie will round his begonias down from $2.12 to $2, since the number following the 2 is less than 5.\nArtie sells 12 marigolds x $3 = $<<12*3=36>>36\nArtie sells 9 petunias x $2 = $<<9*2=18>>18\nArtie sells 17 begonias x $2 = $<<17*2=34>>34\nAltogether, Artie will make $36 + $18 + $34 = $<<36+18+34=88>>88\n#### 88"
