    "question": "A loaf of bread at the bakery costs $2. Bagels cost $1 each. How much more do 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost for each and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of 3 loaves of bread:\n- Each loaf of bread costs $2.\n- Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of 2 bagels:\n- Each bagel costs $1.\n- Therefore, 2 bagels cost \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) dollars.\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the total cost of 3 loaves of bread and the total cost of 2 bagels:\n- The total cost of 3 loaves of bread is $6.\n- The total cost of 2 bagels is $2.\n- The difference is \\(6 - 2 = 4\\) dollars.\n\nThus, 3 loaves of bread cost \\(\\boxed{4}\\) dollars more than 2 bagels.",
    "answer": "3 loaves of bread cost 3 * $2 = $<<3*2=6>>6.\n2 bagels cost 2 * $1 = $<<2*1=2>>2.\nThe loaves of bread cost $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 more than the bagels.\n#### 4"
