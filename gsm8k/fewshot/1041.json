    "question": "Molly is catering a birthday party for her sister and invited 16 people. 10 people want the chicken salad which is $6.50 per person and 6 people want the pasta salad at $6 per person. What is the total amount Molly will pay for the catering?",
    "completion": "To calculate the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to consider the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Chicken Salad Cost:**\n   - Number of people who want chicken salad: 10\n   - Cost per person: $6.50\n   - Total cost for chicken salad: \\( 10 \\times 6.50 \\)\n\n2. **Pasta Salad Cost:**\n   - Number of people who want pasta salad: 6\n   - Cost per person: $6\n   - Total cost for pasta salad: \\( 6 \\times 6 \\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost:\n\n1. **Chicken Salad Cost:**\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 6.50 = 65\n   \\]\n\n2. **Pasta Salad Cost:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 6 = 36\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Cost:**\n   \\[\n   65 + 36 = 101\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.",
    "answer": "Multiply the number of people who want chicken salad by the cost per person, so the cost is 10 x $6.50 = $<<10*6.5=65>>65.\nMultiply the amount of people who want pasta salad by the cost per person, so the cost is 6 x $6.00 = $<<6*6=36>>36.\nThe total cost of chicken salad and pasta salad is $65 + $36 = $<<65+36=101>>101.\n#### 101"
