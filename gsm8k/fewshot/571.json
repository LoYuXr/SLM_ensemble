    "question": "Leah just got a new kitten. Spaying her cost $200, her 3 vaccines costs $20 each, and the kitten broke 4 vases that cost $12 each. How much has the kitten cost so far?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of the kitten, we need to add up all the individual costs:\n\n1. The cost of spaying the kitten: $200\n2. The cost of the 3 vaccines: $20 each, so $20 * 3 = $60\n3. The cost of the broken vases: $12 each, so $12 * 4 = $48\n\nNow, we add these amounts together:\n\n$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (vases) = $308\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the kitten so far is $308.",
    "answer": "First find the total cost of the vaccines: $20/vaccine * 3 vaccines = $<<20*3=60>>60\nThen find the total cost of the vases: 4 vases * $12/vase = $<<4*12=48>>48\nThen add the cost of the vaccines and vases to the cost of the spaying to find the total cost: $200 + $48 + $60 = $<<200+48+60=308>>308\n#### 308"
