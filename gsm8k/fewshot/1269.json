    "question": "Elvis starts driving from his house and travels west for 5 hours. Then he turns around and travels east for 8 hours. If he was driving at an average speed of 18mph for both parts of the journey, how far is he from his house now?",
    "completion": "To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he travels and then subtract that from his starting point.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Elvis travels west:\n- Elvis travels for 5 hours.\n- His average speed is 18 mph.\n- Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 18 mph \u00d7 5 hours = 90 miles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance Elvis travels east:\n- Elvis travels for 8 hours.\n- His average speed is 18 mph.\n- Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 18 mph \u00d7 8 hours = 144 miles.\n\nNow, we add the distances traveled west and east to find the total distance Elvis has traveled:\n- Total distance traveled = Distance west + Distance east = 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total distance traveled from the starting point to find out how far Elvis is from his house:\n- Starting point = Elvis's house.\n- Distance from house = Total distance traveled - Starting point = 234 miles - 0 miles = 234 miles.\n\nTherefore, Elvis is \\(\\boxed{234}\\) miles from his house.",
    "answer": "During the first part of the journey he travels west for 5 hours at a speed of 18mph so he covered a distance of 5*18 = <<5*18=90>>90 miles\nThen he travels east at the same speed for 8 hours so he covered a distance of 8*18 = <<8*18=144>>144 miles\nHis distance from his house now is the difference between his east and west movements which is 144-90 = <<144-90=54>>54 miles\n#### 54"
