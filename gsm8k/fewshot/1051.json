    "question": "Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.  If there are 16 cups in a gallon, how many gallons of water does she drink in 30 days?",
    "completion": "To determine how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days.\n2. Convert the total number of cups into gallons.\n\nFirst, we know that Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Therefore, in 30 days, she will drink:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ cups/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 240 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the total number of cups into gallons. We know that there are 16 cups in a gallon. So, we divide the total number of cups by 16:\n\\[ 240 \\text{ cups} \\div 16 \\text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]",
    "answer": "She drinks 8 cups of water a day so after 30 days she drinks 8*30 = <<8*30=240>>240 cups of water\nThere are 16 cups in 1 gallon so she drinks 240/16 = <<240/16=15>>15 gallons of water in 30 days\n#### 15"
