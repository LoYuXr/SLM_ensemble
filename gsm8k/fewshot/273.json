    "question": "Terri is knitting a sweater with two sleeves, a collar, and a decorative rosette. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete, the collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, and the rosette takes twice as many as the collar. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. How many stitches does each sleeve take?",
    "completion": "To determine how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of stitches for the collar.\n2. Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette.\n3. Determine the total number of stitches for the body of the sweater.\n4. Subtract the number of stitches for the body from the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches for the sleeves.\n5. Divide the number of stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n\n1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.\n2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Stitches for collar} = \\frac{900}{10} = 90\n   \\]\n3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Stitches for rosette} = 2 \\times 90 = 180\n   \\]\n4. The total number of stitches for the body is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Stitches for body} = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170\n   \\]\n5. The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches for the sleeves is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Stitches for sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630\n   \\]\n6. The number of stitches per sleeve is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Stitches per sleeve} = \\frac{630}{2} = 315\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of stitches each sleeve takes is \\(\\boxed{315}\\).",
    "answer": "The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.\nThe rosette takes 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 stitches.\nThe body, collar, and rosette together take 900 + 90 + 180 = <<900+90+180=1170>>1170 stitches.\nThus, the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = <<1800-1170=630>>630 stitches.\nThus, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = <<630/2=315>>315 stitches.\n#### 315"
