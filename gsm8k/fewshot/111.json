    "question": "Julia\u2019s boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?",
    "completion": "To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the boat's speed in liters per second:**\n   - The boat takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet.\n   - The boat takes 20 feet in 16 seconds, so the speed is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Speed} = \\frac{20 \\text{ feet}}{16 \\text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \\text{ feet per second}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the distance to the shore:**\n   - The shore is 64 seconds away.\n   - The boat takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet.\n   - Therefore, the distance to the shore is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = 64 \\text{ seconds} \\times 16 \\text{ feet per second} = 1024 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total volume of water taken on by the boat:**\n   - The boat takes 1024 feet of water.\n   - The boat takes 20 feet of water per row.\n   - Therefore, the total volume of water taken on is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total volume} = 1024 \\text{ feet} \\times 20 \\text{ feet per row} = 20480 \\text{ liters}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total volume of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is \\(\\boxed{20480}\\) liters.",
    "answer": "It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.\nThus, she had to row 20 * 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 feet back to shore.\nIn those 80 feet, she took on 2 liters of water 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 times.\nThus, the boat had taken on 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.\n#### 16"
