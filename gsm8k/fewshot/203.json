    "question": "Carl\u2019s favorite food is cheese. He ate a sandwich every day this week for lunch and used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it. How many slices of cheese did he use?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of slices of cheese used for sandwiches:**\n   Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, and he used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of slices of cheese used for sandwiches is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ slices/sandwich} \\times 7 \\text{ sandwiches} = 14 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of slices of cheese used for omelets:**\n   Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week. He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, he used 3 slices of cheese on each omelet. Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese used for omelets is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ slices/omelet} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 9 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**\n   Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, which used 8 slices of cheese. This is the only dish he made, so the total number of slices of cheese used is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of slices of cheese used:**\n   Adding up all the slices of cheese used, we get:\n   \\[\n   14 \\text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \\text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \\text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 31 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is \\(\\boxed{31}\\).",
    "answer": "His 2-slice sandwiches used 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 slices of cheese for all 7 days of the week.\nHis cheese and egg omelets used one more slice than his sandwiches, so they used 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 slices of cheese each.\nHe made 3 omelets, so they used 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 slices of cheese.\nCarl\u2019s sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni used 14 + 9 + 8 = <<14+9+8=31>>31 slices of cheese in all.\n#### 31"
