    "question": "Jada, Rory, and Kora make clay dishes to present as art for their school project. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, while Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora. If Kora made 20 dishes, how many clay dishes they all make together?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of dishes made by Kora.\n2. Calculate the number of dishes made by Rory.\n3. Calculate the number of dishes made by Jada.\n4. Sum the number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora.\n\nStep 1: Kora made 20 dishes.\n\\[ \\text{Dishes made by Kora} = 20 \\]\n\nStep 2: Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora.\n\\[ \\text{Dishes made by Rory} = 20 + 20 = 40 \\]\n\nStep 3: Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory.\n\\[ \\text{Dishes made by Jada} = 2 \\times 40 = 80 \\]\n\nStep 4: Sum the number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora.\n\\[ \\text{Total dishes} = \\text{Dishes made by Jada} + \\text{Dishes made by Rory} + \\text{Dishes made by Kora} = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora is \\(\\boxed{140}\\).",
    "answer": "If Kora made 20 clay dishes, Rory made 20 clay dishes + 20 clay dishes = <<20+20=40>>40 clay dishes.\nJada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory, which totals 2 * 40 clay dishes = <<2*40=80>>80 clay dishes.\nThe total number of clay dishes made by the three is 80 from Jada + 40 from Rory + 20 from Kora = <<80+40+20=140>>140 clay dishes\n#### 140"
