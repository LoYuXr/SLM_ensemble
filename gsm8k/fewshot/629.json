    "question": "James gets a job selling used cars.  He sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each.  The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars.  He got a 10% commission on the profits.  How much did he make?",
    "completion": "To determine how much James made from selling the cars, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the cars James sold.\n2. Determine the amount paid by the company for the cars.\n3. Calculate the profit from the sale of the cars.\n4. Determine the commission James earned on the profit.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the cars:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 10 \\text{ cars} \\times \\$25,000 \\text{ per car} = \\$250,000\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the amount paid by the company for the cars:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount paid by the company} = 30\\% \\text{ of } \\$250,000 = 0.30 \\times \\$250,000 = \\$75,000\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the profit from the sale of the cars:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = \\text{Total cost} - \\text{Amount paid by the company} = \\$250,000 - \\$75,000 = \\$175,000\n   \\]\n\n4. Determine the commission James earned on the profit:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Commission} = 10\\% \\text{ of } \\$175,000 = 0.10 \\times \\$175,000 = \\$17,500\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount James made is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{175000}\n\\]",
    "answer": "He sold the car for 25000*10=$<<25000*10=250000>>250,000\nEach car was bought for 25,000*.3=$<<25000*.3=7500>>7500\nSo they bought the cars for 7500*10=$<<7500*10=75000>>75,000\nThat means the cars had a profit of 250,000-75,000=$<<250000-75000=175000>>175,000\nSo his commission was 175,000*.1=$<<175000*.1=17500>>17,500\n#### 17500"
