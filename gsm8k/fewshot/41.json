    "question": "The great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 1000 feet.  Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?",
    "completion": "To determine how far Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. The dragon's reach is 1000 feet.\n2. Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet.\n3. Polly can throw the sapphire gemstone 3 times farther than the gold javelin.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Polly's range with the sapphire gemstone:\n\\[ 400 \\text{ feet} \\times 3 = 1200 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how far Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin. Since the dragon's reach is 1000 feet, Polly can stand within 1000 feet of the dragon.\n\nNow, we need to find out how far Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin. Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet, and the dragon's reach is 1000 feet. Therefore, Polly can stand within:\n\\[ 1000 \\text{ feet} - 400 \\text{ feet} = 600 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nSo, Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin within a distance of 600 feet.",
    "answer": "With the gemstone, Polly could throw the javelin 3 times farther than 400 feet, for a distance of 3*400=<<3*400=1200>>1200 feet.\n1200 feet is beyond the 1000-foot reach of the dragon's flames by a distance of 1200-1000=<<1200-1000=200>>200 feet.\n#### 200"
