    "question": "Mike needed a new pair of jeans.  When he got to the mall he saw that his favorite jeans were advertised 25% off.  The original price of the jeans was $40.  How much money will Mike have left over if he pays with a $50.00 bill?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Mike will have left over after buying the jeans, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discount amount.\n2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price of the jeans.\n3. Subtract the total amount spent from the $50.00 bill.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the discount amount:**\n   The original price of the jeans is $40. The discount is 25%. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by 25% (or 0.25):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount amount} = 40 \\times 0.25 = 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the discount amount from the original price:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price after discount} = 40 - 10 = 30\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the total amount spent from the $50.00 bill:**\n   Mike pays with a $50.00 bill, so we subtract the price of the jeans from $50.00:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount left} = 50 - 30 = 20\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Mike will have left over is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
    "answer": "The jeans cost $40 and are sale for 25% off so 40 * .25 = $<<40*.25=10.00>>10.00 discount\nTake the original cost of the jeans and subtract the discount so 40-10 = $<<40-10=30.00>>30.00\nMike pays with a $50 bill and the final cost of the jeans is $30 so 50-30 = $<<50-30=20.00>>20.00 left\n#### 20"
