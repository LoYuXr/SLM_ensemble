    "question": "Justin has a jar with many coins in it. The jar has 32 quarters, 95 dimes, 120 nickels, and 750 pennies. What is the total dollar amount in the jar?",
    "completion": "To determine the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the quarters:\n- Each quarter is worth $0.25.\n- There are 32 quarters in the jar.\n- The total value of the quarters is:\n  \\[\n  32 \\times 0.25 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the value of the dimes:\n- Each dime is worth $0.10.\n- There are 95 dimes in the jar.\n- The total value of the dimes is:\n  \\[\n  95 \\times 0.10 = 9.50 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the value of the nickels:\n- Each nickel is worth $0.05.\n- There are 120 nickels in the jar.\n- The total value of the nickels is:\n  \\[\n  120 \\times 0.05 = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the value of the pennies:\n- Each penny is worth $0.01.\n- There are 750 pennies in the jar.\n- The total value of the pennies is:\n  \\[\n  750 \\times 0.01 = 7.50 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the values of all the coins to find the total dollar amount in the jar:\n\\[\n8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total dollar amount in the jar is \\boxed{30}.",
    "answer": "There are 32/4 = <<32/4=8>>8 dollars in quarters.\nThere are 95/10 = <<95/10=9.5>>9.5 dollars in dimes.\nThere are 120/20 = <<120/20=6>>6 dollars in nickels.\nThere are 750/100 = <<750/100=7.5>>7.5 dollars in pennies.\nAltogether there are 8+9.5+6+7.5 = <<8+9.5+6+7.5=31>>31 dollars in the jar.\n#### 31"
