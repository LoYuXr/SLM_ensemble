    "question": "Mark buys one lottery ticket with a 20% chance of winning and a second lottery ticket that's three times more likely to win. What is the probability, expressed as a percentage, that both tickets are winners?",
    "completion": "To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to consider the probabilities of each ticket winning and then combine these probabilities.\n\nFirst, let's define the probabilities:\n- The probability that the first lottery ticket wins is 20%, or 0.20.\n- The probability that the second lottery ticket wins is three times the probability that the first ticket wins. Since the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, the second ticket has a \\(3 \\times 0.20 = 0.60\\) chance of winning.\n\nThe probability that both tickets win is the product of the probabilities that each ticket wins. Therefore, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 0.60 = 0.12\n\\]\n\nTo express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n\\[\n0.12 \\times 100 = 12\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \\(\\boxed{12\\%}\\).",
    "answer": "First triple 20% to find the second ticket's chance of winning: .2 * 3 = <<.2*3=.6>>.6\nThen multiply both tickets' chances of winning to find the probability they both win, and multiply that by 100 to convert it to a percentage: .6 * .2 * 100% = 12%\n#### 12"
