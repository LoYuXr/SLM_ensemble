    "question": "Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. How old is Seth?",
    "completion": "Let's denote Brooke's current age as \\( B \\) and Seth's current age as \\( S \\). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:\n\n\\[ S = 2B \\]\n\nIn 2 years, Brooke's age will be \\( B + 2 \\) and Seth's age will be \\( S + 2 \\). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( S = 2B \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[ B + 2B + 2 + 2 = 28 \\]\n\\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \\]\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 3B = 24 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ B = 8 \\]\n\nNow that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using the relationship \\( S = 2B \\):\n\n\\[ S = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\]\n\nSo, Seth is currently 16 years old.",
    "answer": "To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke\u2019s age and 2x represents Seth\u2019s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.\nThen we add all the values together, 3x + 4 = 28.\nAnd we subtract 4 from each side, 3x +4 - 4 = 28 \u2013 4.\nThen we divide each side by 3x/3 = 24/3.\nWe find that x = <<8=8>>8, or Brooke\u2019s age is 8.\nSeth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.\n#### 16"
