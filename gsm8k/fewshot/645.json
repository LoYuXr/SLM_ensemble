    "question": "A bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. How much flour (in kilograms) was in three bags in total, before it was divided into portions?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of flour in one bag.\n2. Multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by three to find the total amount of flour in three bags.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of flour in one bag. The bag is divided into 8 portions, and each portion is 2 kilograms. Therefore, the total amount of flour in one bag is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ portions} \\times 2 \\text{ kilograms/portion} = 16 \\text{ kilograms} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the total amount of flour in three bags. Since each bag contains 16 kilograms of flour, the total amount of flour in three bags is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ bags} \\times 16 \\text{ kilograms/bag} = 48 \\text{ kilograms} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\] kilograms.",
    "answer": "A bag of flour has 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 kilograms.\nSo, there are 16 x 3 = <<16*3=48>>48 kilograms of flour in 3 bags.\n#### 48"
