    "question": "A basket of green food costs $25 and a basket of red food costs $18. If you buy 3 baskets of green food and red food, how much will you have to pay in total if you get $2 off for each basket of red food?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food after applying the $2 off for each basket of red food, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 25 = 75\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 18 = 54\n   \\]\n\n3. Determine the total cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food before any discounts:\n   \\[\n   75 + 54 = 129\n   \\]\n\n4. Apply the $2 off for each basket of red food:\n   \\[\n   129 - 2 \\times 3 = 129 - 6 = 123\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount you will have to pay is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{123}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The 3 baskets of green food will cost $25 x 3 = $<<25*3=75>>75.\nThe 3 baskets of red food will cost $18 x 3 = $<<18*3=54>>54.\nThere will be $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6 off for the baskets of red food.\nSo, the 3 baskets of red food will now cost $54 - $6 = $<<54-6=48>>48.\nYou will have to pay $75 + $48 = $<<75+48=123>>123 for all the baskets of food.\n#### 123"
