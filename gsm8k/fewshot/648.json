    "question": "Howie wants to buy cupcakes for everyone in his class as a special treat. He's not sure if people will want vanilla or chocolate cupcakes so he decides to get one of each for everyone. If he gets the same amount of 2 cupcakes for each himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates, how many cupcakes should Howie buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how many cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to consider the total number of people in his class and the fact that he is getting the same amount of 2 cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Total number of people in the class**: 25 classmates + 1 teacher = 26 people.\n2. **Howie's share**: He is getting 2 cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. So, he is getting \\(2 + 2 + 25 = 29\\) cupcakes.\n3. **Total number of cupcakes**: Since he is getting 29 cupcakes and he is getting the same amount for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates, the total number of cupcakes he should buy is 29.\n\nTherefore, Howie should buy \\(\\boxed{29}\\) cupcakes.",
    "answer": "Howie wants to get cupcakes for his 25 classmates + his 1 teacher + 1 himself = <<25+1+1=27>>27 people.\nHe wants to get 2 cupcakes for everyone, so 27 people x 2 cupcakes each = <<27*2=54>>54 cupcakes that Howie should buy.\n#### 54"
