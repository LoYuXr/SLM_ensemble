    "question": "Rory makes a cake that weighs 20 ounces. She cuts into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each have a piece. How much does the remaining cake weigh?",
    "completion": "To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of the cake.\n2. Determine the total weight of the cake that Rory and her mom each have.\n3. Subtract the total weight of the cake that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake to find the weight of the remaining cake.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of the cake. The cake weighs 20 ounces and it is cut into 8 pieces. So, the total weight of the cake is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ ounces} \\times 8 = 160 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total weight of the cake that Rory and her mom each have. Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, the total weight of the cake that they have is:\n\\[ 160 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total weight of the cake that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake to find the weight of the remaining cake:\n\\[ 160 \\text{ ounces} - 160 \\text{ ounces} = 0 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nTherefore, the weight of the remaining cake is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]",
    "answer": "Each piece of Rory\u2019s cake weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = <<20/8=2.5>>2.5 ounces.\nIf Rory and her mom each have a slice, they will have eaten 2.5 ounces + 2.5 ounces = <<2.5+2.5=5>>5 ounces.\nThe rest of the cake weighs 20 ounces \u2013 5 ounces = <<20-5=15>>15 ounces.\n#### 15"
