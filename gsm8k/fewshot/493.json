    "question": "Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack.  They are currently on sale for buy one get one free.  She also has a $2.00 coupon.  How much will each individual razor cost, in cents, after the discount if she buys 2 packs of razors?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of razors:**\n   Each pack costs $4.00, and there are 4 packs.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of 4 packs} = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the buy one get one free offer:**\n   Since the packs are sold in a 4-1-4 sequence, for every 4 packs, you get 1 pack for free. Therefore, for 4 packs, you only pay for 3 packs.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of 3 packs} = 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the $2.00 coupon:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of 3 packs after coupon} = 12 - 2 = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the cost per razor:**\n   Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost per razor is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per razor} = \\frac{10 \\text{ dollars}}{4 \\text{ razors}} = 2.50 \\text{ dollars per razor}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**\n   \\[\n   2.50 \\text{ dollars} = 2.50 \\times 100 = 250 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost per individual razor after the discount is \\(\\boxed{250}\\) cents.",
    "answer": "Buy one get one free means she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 and she has a $2.00 coupon, so the razors will cost her $4-$2 = $2.00\nEach pack has 4 razors and she buys 2 packs for a total of 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 razors\nThe razors cost $2.00 and she bought 8 so that means each razor costs $2.00/8 = $<<2/8=0.25>>0.25 each\n#### 25"
