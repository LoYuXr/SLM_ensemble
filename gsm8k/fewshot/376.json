    "question": "There are 40 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pupils like the color yellow, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of pupils who like blue:**\n   Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of pupils who like blue} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 40 = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of pupils remaining after those who like blue:**\n   Subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of pupils who like green:**\n   One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. First, find the number of remaining pupils:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining pupils} = 20\n   \\]\n   Then, calculate the number of pupils who like green:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of pupils who like green} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20 = 5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of pupils who like yellow:**\n   Subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of pupils who like yellow} = 40 - 20 - 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
    "answer": "There are 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pupils who like blue.\nSo, there are now 40 - 20 = <<40-20=20>>20 pupils who like either green or yellow.\nHence, 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 pupils like green.\nThus, 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 pupils like yellow.\n#### 15"
