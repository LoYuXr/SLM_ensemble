    "question": "Sally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60. Find her mean score.",
    "completion": "To find Sally's mean score, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Sum the scores**: Add all the individual scores together.\n2. **Count the number of scores**: Determine how many scores were given.\n3. **Calculate the mean**: Divide the sum of the scores by the number of scores.\n\nLet's go through these steps in detail:\n\n1. **Sum the scores**:\n   \\[\n   50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60\n   \\]\n   Adding these step by step:\n   \\[\n   50 + 80 = 130\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   130 + 80 = 210\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   210 + 60 = 270\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   270 + 40 = 310\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   310 + 90 = 400\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   400 + 100 = 500\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   500 + 70 = 570\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   570 + 60 = 630\n   \\]\n   So, the sum of the scores is 630.\n\n2. **Count the number of scores**: There are 9 scores given.\n\n3. **Calculate the mean**: Divide the sum of the scores by the number of scores.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mean} = \\frac{630}{9} = 70\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Sally's mean score is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).",
    "answer": "Sally's total score is 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = <<50+80+80+60+40+90+100+70+60=630>>630.\nHer mean score is 630 / 9/quizzes = <<630/9=70>>70/quiz.\n#### 70"
