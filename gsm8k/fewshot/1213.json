    "question": "Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. For 11 months Stephen will give his sister $25 per month and the remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid on the twelfth month. How much will Stephen pay in the twelfth month?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest on the remaining amount after 11 months and then add it to the original amount he borrowed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total interest Stephen will pay over the 11 months. The interest rate is 2% per month, so the total interest is:\n\\[ 300 \\times 0.02 \\times 11 = 66 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much Stephen will owe after paying the interest. He will owe the original $300 plus the interest of $66:\n\\[ 300 + 66 = 366 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month. He will give his sister $25 per month for the first 10 months, so the total amount given in the first 10 months is:\n\\[ 25 \\times 10 = 250 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAfter the first 10 months, the remaining amount to be paid is:\n\\[ 366 - 250 = 116 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince the remaining amount of $116 will be paid on the twelfth month, Stephen will pay:\n\\[ 116 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:\n\\[ \\boxed{116} \\]",
    "answer": "Stephen will pay an additional $300 x 2/100 = $<<300*2/100=6>>6.\nHe should return a total of $300 + $6 = $<<300+6=306>>306.\nFor eleven months Stephen will pay a total of $25 x 11 = $<<25*11=275>>275.\nTherefore, Stephen will pay 306 - 275 = $<<306-275=31>>31 on the twelfth month.\n#### 31"
