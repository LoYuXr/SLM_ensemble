    "question": "There are 26 countries in South America and, in each country, there are 5 cities with 1000 people living in each city.  If the whole population lives in these cities, how many people are there in South America?",
    "completion": "To determine the total population of South America, we need to calculate the total number of people living in all the cities in the country. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the number of cities in each country: There are 26 countries in South America.\n2. Identify the number of cities in each country: Each country has 5 cities.\n3. Identify the number of people living in each city: Each city has 1000 people.\n4. Calculate the total number of people in one city: Since there are 1000 people in each city, the total number of people in one city is \\(1000 \\times 5 = 5000\\).\n5. Calculate the total number of people in all the cities: Since there are 26 cities in each country, the total number of people in all the cities is \\(5000 \\times 26\\).\n\nNow, let's perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[5000 \\times 26 = 130000\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of people in South America is \\(\\boxed{130000}\\).",
    "answer": "Since each country has 5 cities, then in all the 26 countries, there are 26*5 = <<26*5=130>>130 cities.\nIf each city has 1000 people, then the 130 cities have 130*1000 = 130000\n#### 130000"
