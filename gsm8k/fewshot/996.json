    "question": "Four children are playing together\u2014Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the total age of the children is 20. If Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old, calculate the age of Wilfred.",
    "completion": "To determine the age of Wilfred, we start by calculating the average age of the four children. The total age of the four children is given as 20 years. Therefore, the average age is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average age} = \\frac{\\text{Total age}}{\\text{Number of children}} = \\frac{20}{4} = 5 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Since the average age is 5 years, Helene's age is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Helene's age} = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nWe are also given that the total age of the children is 20 years. Let's denote the ages of the children as \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\). We know \\(A = 3\\) and \\(D = 4\\). Therefore, the sum of the ages of the children is:\n\n\\[\nA + B + C + D = 3 + B + C + 4 = 7 + B + C = 20\n\\]\n\nFrom this equation, we can solve for \\(B + C\\):\n\n\\[\nB + C = 20 - 7 = 13\n\\]\n\nSince Helene is 10 years old, and the average age is 5 years, we can find the age of Wilfred by subtracting the ages of Helene and Alessandro from the total age of the children:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Wilfred's age} = \\text{Total age} - (\\text{Helene's age} + \\text{Alessandro's age}) = 20 - (10 + 4) = 20 - 14 = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, the age of Wilfred is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",
    "answer": "If the combined age of the children is 20, the average age of the group is 20 years / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 years.\nHelene is twice as old as the group's average age, meaning Helene is 2 * 5 years = <<2*5=10>>10 years old.\nThe total age of the three children is 10 years + 3 years + 4 years = <<10+3+4=17>>17 years.\nWilfred's age is 20 years - 17 years = <<20-17=3>>3 years.\n#### 3"
