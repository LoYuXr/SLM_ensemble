    "question": "9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64\" tall.  The 10th cheerleader is 60\" tall.  If they build a human pyramid, where 4 girls are on the bottom,  3 stand on top of the 4, 2 stand on top of the 3 and the shortest girl is at the top, how tall is the human pyramid in feet?",
    "completion": "To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total height of the 10 cheerleaders:**\n   - The 9 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall.\n   - The 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall.\n   - Total height of the 10 cheerleaders: \\( 64 + 60 = 124 \\) inches.\n\n2. **Determine the height of the tallest cheerleader:**\n   - The tallest cheerleader is 60 inches tall.\n\n3. **Calculate the total height of the 4 tallest cheerleaders:**\n   - Each of the 4 tallest cheerleaders is 60 inches tall.\n   - Total height of the 4 tallest cheerleaders: \\( 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\) inches.\n\n4. **Determine the height of the shortest cheerleader:**\n   - The shortest cheerleader is at the top of the pyramid.\n   - The total height of the 10 cheerleaders is 124 inches.\n   - Subtract the height of the tallest cheerleaders from the total height: \\( 124 - 240 = -116 \\) inches.\n   - This negative value indicates that the shortest cheerleader is 116 inches below the top of the pyramid.\n\n5. **Calculate the height of the shortest cheerleader:**\n   - The shortest cheerleader is 116 inches below the top of the pyramid.\n   - Since the shortest cheerleader is at the top, the height of the shortest cheerleader is 116 inches.\n\n6. **Determine the height of the 3 middle cheerleaders:**\n   - The 3 middle cheerleaders are 60 inches tall each.\n   - Total height of the 3 middle cheerleaders: \\( 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\) inches.\n\n7. **Calculate the total height of the 5 middle cheerleaders:**\n   - Total height of the 5 middle cheerleaders: \\( 180 + 180 = 360 \\) inches.\n\n8. **Determine the height of the 2 shortest cheerleaders:**\n   - The 2 shortest cheerleaders are 60 inches tall each.\n   - Total height of the 2 shortest cheerleaders: \\( 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\) inches.\n\n",
    "answer": "All but one cheerleader is 64\" tall and these cheerleaders make up the bottom 3 layers of the pyramid. So, when standing on top of each other, they are 64*3 = <<64*3=192>>192\" tall\nThe shortest cheerleader is at the top of the pyramid and is 60\" tall so the pyramid is 192+60 = <<252=252>>252\" tall\n12\" are in 1 foot and the pyramid is 252\" tall so it's 252/12 = <<252/12=21>>21 feet tall\n#### 21"
