    "question": "Bob wants to dig a hole 6 feet long by 4 feet wide by 3 feet deep. If it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, how long will it take him to dig the hole?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to calculate the volume of the hole and then use the time it takes to shovel that volume of earth.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \\( V \\) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:\n\\[ V = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{depth} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given dimensions:\n\\[ V = 6 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 4 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 3 \\, \\text{feet} \\]\n\\[ V = 72 \\, \\text{cubic feet} \\]\n\nNext, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \\( T \\) it will take him to dig the hole is the volume of the hole divided by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:\n\\[ T = \\frac{V}{\\text{time per cubic foot}} \\]\n\\[ T = \\frac{72 \\, \\text{cubic feet}}{3 \\, \\text{seconds per cubic foot}} \\]\n\\[ T = 24 \\, \\text{seconds} \\]\n\nSo, it will take Bob \\(\\boxed{24}\\) seconds to dig the hole.",
    "answer": "The hole is 6 feet long by 4 feet wide by 3 feet deep or 6 * 4 * 3 = <<6*4*3=72>>72 cubic feet.\nBob shovels a cubic foot of earth every 3 seconds so it will take 72 * 3 = <<72*3=216>>216 seconds to dig the hole.\n#### 216"
