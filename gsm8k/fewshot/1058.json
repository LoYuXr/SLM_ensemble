    "question": "Leo collects stickers. Two years ago, he had 100 stickers in his collection. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year. How many stickers does Leo have in his collection?",
    "completion": "To determine how many stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to follow the information given step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of stickers two years ago:**\n   Leo had 100 stickers two years ago.\n\n2. **Number of stickers collected last year:**\n   Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.\n\n3. **Number of stickers collected this year:**\n   This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers he collected last year. Therefore, the number of stickers collected this year is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 50 = 100\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total number of stickers in Leo's collection:**\n   To find the total number of stickers Leo has now, we add the number of stickers he had two years ago to the number of stickers he collected this year:\n   \\[\n   100 + 100 = 200\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is \\(\\boxed{200}\\).",
    "answer": "Last year, Leo had 100 +50 = <<100+50=150>>150.\nThis year, he collected 2 x 50 = <<2*50=100>>100.\nTherefore, Leo had 150 + 100 = <<150+100=250>>250 stickers in his collection.\n#### 250"
