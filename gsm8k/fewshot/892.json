    "question": "Ellen is on a diet. She eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs her $6, while the yogurt is half the price. How much does Ellen pay for one carrot every day when in total she pays $11 for her goods?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the cost of the salad and the yogurt:**\n   - The salad costs $6.\n   - The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the salad and the yogurt:**\n   - The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is \\( 6 + 3 = 9 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Determine the cost of one carrot:**\n   - Ellen eats two carrots every day.\n   - The total cost for the carrots is $11.\n   - Therefore, the cost of one carrot is \\( \\frac{11}{2} = 5.5 \\) dollars.\n\nSo, Ellen pays \\(\\boxed{5.5}\\) dollars for one carrot every day.",
    "answer": "Ellen's yogurt cost is half the price of the salad, so it's $6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3.\nFor the two carrots Ellen needs to pay $11 - $6 - $3 = $<<11-6-3=2>>2.\nSo one carrot costs $2 / $2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.\n#### 1"
