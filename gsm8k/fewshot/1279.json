    "question": "Avery needs to buy a 3 piece place setting (dinner & salad plate and a bowl) for her holiday dinner.  She\u2019s having 12 people over for dinner.  If the dinner plates cost $6.00 each and bowls each cost $5.00 and the salad plates cost $4.00, how much will she spend on place settings?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Avery will spend on the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then sum these costs.\n\n1. **Cost of the dinner plates:**\n   - Each dinner plate costs $6.00.\n   - Avery is having 12 people over.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the dinner plates is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ plates} \\times \\$6.00 \\text{ per plate} = \\$72.00\n     \\]\n\n2. **Cost of the bowls:**\n   - Each bowl costs $5.00.\n   - Avery is having 12 people over.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the bowls is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ bowls} \\times \\$5.00 \\text{ per bowl} = \\$60.00\n     \\]\n\n3. **Cost of the salad plates:**\n   - Each salad plate costs $4.00.\n   - Avery is having 12 people over.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the salad plates is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ plates} \\times \\$4.00 \\text{ per plate} = \\$48.00\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total cost for the place settings:**\n   - Add the costs of the dinner plates, bowls, and salad plates:\n     \\[\n     \\$72.00 + \\$60.00 + \\$48.00 = \\$180.00\n     \\]\n\nThus, Avery will spend \\(\\boxed{180}\\) dollars on the place settings.",
    "answer": "Each place setting will need a dinner plate that\u2019s $6.00, a bowl for $5.00 and a salad plate that\u2019s $4.00 so each place setting will cost 6+5+4 = $<<6+5+4=15.00>>15.00\nShe needs 12 place settings for her guests and they're $15.00 each so she will spend 12*15 = $<<12*15=180.00>>180.00 on the place settings.\n#### 180"
