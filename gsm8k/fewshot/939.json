    "question": "Craig and his brother take turns spelling out the longest letter words they know and counting the number of the letters in those words. After ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. If Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, calculate the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds.",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of letters in the words spelled out by Craig and his brother after ten rounds, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of letters spelled out by Craig in ten rounds:**\n   - Craig spells out 20 words with 15 letters each.\n   - Therefore, the total number of letters spelled out by Craig is:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 15 = 300\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of letters spelled out by Craig's brother:**\n   - Craig's brother spells out words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig.\n   - Since Craig spells out 300 letters, his brother spells out:\n     \\[\n     300 + 50 = 350\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total number of letters spelled out by Craig's brother is 350.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of letters spelled out by both Craig and his brother:**\n   - The total number of letters spelled out by both is:\n     \\[\n     300 + 350 = 650\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is \\(\\boxed{650}\\).",
    "answer": "After ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20*15 = <<20*15=300>>300 letters from the longest letter words he knows.\nSince Craig's brother spelled out words with a total count of 50 more letters than Craig's words, he got 300+50 = 350 letters.\nThe brothers spelled out words with a total count of 350+300 = <<350+300=650>>650 letters.\n#### 650"
