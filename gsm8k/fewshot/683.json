    "question": "Chris has a two-speed lawn mower. He can mow his entire lawn in \"turtle\" mode in 1 hour, or 40 minutes in \"rabbit\" mode. Today, he experimented by mowing half in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. How many minutes did it take him to mow the lawn?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total time spent in each mode and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, let's convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 40 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{40}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the time spent in each mode:\n- In turtle mode, Chris mows the entire lawn in 1 hour. So, the time spent in turtle mode is 1 hour.\n- In rabbit mode, Chris mows half the lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, the time spent in rabbit mode is:\n\\[ \\frac{40}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we sum the time spent in each mode to find the total time:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ hour} + \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ hours} = 1 + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{5}{3} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTo convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:\n\\[ \\frac{5}{3} \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = \\frac{5 \\times 60}{3} \\text{ minutes} = 5 \\times 20 \\text{ minutes} = 100 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]",
    "answer": "He spends 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 minutes in turtle mode\nHe spends 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 minutes in rabbit mode\nHe took 30+20=<<30+20=50>>50 minutes to mow the lawn.\n#### 50"
