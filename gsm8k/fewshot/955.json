    "question": "A hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the current number of occupied beds.\n2. Determine the number of patients admitted each day.\n3. Calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.\n4. Determine the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the current number of occupied beds.**\n\nThe hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and is currently occupied by \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of the capacity.\n\\[\n\\text{Occupied beds} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 1000 = 200\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of patients admitted each day.**\n\n50 patients are admitted each day.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.**\n\nThere are 14 days in 2 weeks, so the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total patients} = 50 \\times 14 = 700\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.**\n\nThe hospital has 200 occupied beds and 700 patients admitted. Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds is:\n\\[\n\\text{Unoccupied beds} = 200 - 700 = -500\n\\]\n\nSince the number of unoccupied beds cannot be negative, it means that the hospital is already occupied by 500 beds. Therefore, after 2 weeks, the hospital is fully occupied.\n\nThe total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",
    "answer": "If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.\nThe total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.\nIf 50 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients.\nAfter two weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.\nIf there were 800 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 800 beds - 700 beds = <<800-700=100>>100 unoccupied beds.\n#### 100"
