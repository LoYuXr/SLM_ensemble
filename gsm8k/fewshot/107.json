    "question": "Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?",
    "completion": "To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV from Monday to Friday and then subtract that from the total time he watched in all.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV from Monday to Friday:\n\n- Monday: 1 hour\n- Tuesday: 1 hour\n- Wednesday: 1 hour\n- Thursday: 1 hour\n- Friday: 2 hours\n\nAdding these times together:\n\\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFrankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the time he spent watching 30-minute episodes on Wednesday is:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ hours} - 6 \\text{ hours} = 1 \\text{ hour} \\]\n\nSince each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours long, we can find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday by dividing the total time spent on Wednesday by the length of one 30-minute episode:\n\\[ \\frac{1 \\text{ hour}}{0.5 \\text{ hours/episode}} = 2 \\text{ episodes} \\]\n\nThus, Frankie watched \\(\\boxed{2}\\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.",
    "answer": "Let W be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.\nAfter Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.\nAfter Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.\nAfter Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 1/2 = 3 1/2 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 3 1/2 - 2 = 1 1/2 hours of TV left.\nEach 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.\nThus, W = 1 1/2 / 1/2 = 3 episodes.\n#### 3"
