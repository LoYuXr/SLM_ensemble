    "question": "Katerina makes designer jewelry.  Her specialty is topaz necklaces.  She uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and fills the space between gemstones using sterling silver beads.  If each topaz gemstone is one inch long, each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, and each necklace is made to a total length of 25 inches, how many sterling silver beads does Katerina use per necklace?",
    "completion": "To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones used per necklace:**\n   - Each necklace uses 8 topaz gemstones.\n   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.\n   - Therefore, the total length of the topaz gemstones used per necklace is:\n     \\[\n     8 \\text{ gemstones} \\times 1 \\text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total length of the space between the gemstones:**\n   - Each necklace is 25 inches long.\n   - The space between the gemstones is the total length of the necklace minus the length of the topaz gemstones:\n     \\[\n     25 \\text{ inches} - 8 \\text{ inches} = 17 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace:**\n   - Each bead is 0.25 inches long (since each bead is one-quarter of an inch long).\n   - The number of beads used per necklace is the total length of the space between the gemstones divided by the length of each bead:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{17 \\text{ inches}}{0.25 \\text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \\text{ beads}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Katerina uses \\(\\boxed{68}\\) sterling silver beads per necklace.",
    "answer": "8 topaz gemstones, at 1 inch per gemstone, contribute a total of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 inches to each necklace.\nSince each necklace is 25 inches in length, then there are 25-8=<<25-8=17>>17 inches of space between gemstones.\nSince Katerina uses one-quarter inch sterling silver beads to fill space between gemstones, then she will require 17*4=<<17*4=68>>68 sterling silver beads per necklace.\n#### 68"
