    "question": "Sophia and Rose went together to the market to buy onions and potatoes. Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. If Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, how many onions and potatoes in total did Sophia buy at the market?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we start by defining the variables and using the given information.\n\nLet's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \\( x \\). According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought. Therefore, the number of onions Rose bought is \\( 4x \\).\n\nWe are also given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since the problem does not specify the number of potatoes Rose bought, we can assume that the number of potatoes Rose bought is 0 (as no other information is provided about the number of potatoes Rose bought). Therefore, the number of potatoes Rose bought is 0.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Sophia bought \\( x \\) onions and \\( 4x \\) potatoes. The total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought is:\n\\[ x + 4x = 5x \\]\n\nSince the problem does not provide the value of \\( x \\), the total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought is expressed in terms of \\( x \\). However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought based on the information given, we can conclude that the total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought is:\n\\[ 5x \\]\n\nBut since the problem does not provide the value of \\( x \\), the most accurate answer we can give based on the information given is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5x} \\]",
    "answer": "The number of onions Sophia bought is 12 / 4 = <<12/4=3>>3 onions.\nThe number of potatoes Sophia bought is 4 / 4 = <<4/4=1>>1 potato.\nSo, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought at the market is 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4.\n#### 4"
