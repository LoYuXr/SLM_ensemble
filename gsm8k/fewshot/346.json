    "question": "Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week.  The bag has 36 cookies and she puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week.  Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days.  Jenny eats the rest of the cookies.  How many cookies does Jenny eat?",
    "completion": "To determine how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she buys and the total number of cookies she eats each week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys each week. She buys 1 bag of cookies, which has 36 cookies. She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week. Therefore, the number of cookies she puts in her son's lunch box each week is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ cookies/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 20 \\text{ cookies/week} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of cookies her husband eats each week. He eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the number of cookies he eats each week is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ cookie/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 7 \\text{ cookies/week} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of cookies Jenny buys to the number of cookies her husband eats to find the total number of cookies she eats each week:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ cookies/week} + 7 \\text{ cookies/week} = 27 \\text{ cookies/week} \\]\n\nSince the problem does not specify the number of weeks, we assume she eats the cookies for one week. Therefore, the total number of cookies Jenny eats is:\n\\[ \\boxed{27} \\]",
    "answer": "The son gets 4 cookies a day for 5 days so he eats 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20 cookies\nHer husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days so he eats 1*7 = <<1*7=7>>7 cookies\nThere are 36 cookies in a bag and her son eats 20 and her husband eats 7 so Jenny eats 36-20-7 = <<36-20-7=9>>9 cookies\n#### 9"
