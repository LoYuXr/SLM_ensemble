    "question": "To make a profit of $2000, Isaias has to sell the chickens he planned to take to the market from his farm at $50 per chicken. If Isaias has 300 chickens on his farm and plans to sell 3/5 of them, for how much money did Isaias buy the chicken he took to the market for sale?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.\n2. Determine the total cost of the chickens he plans to sell.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of his 300 chickens. So, we perform the following calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of chickens to be sold} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 300 = \\frac{3 \\times 300}{5} = \\frac{900}{5} = 180\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the 180 chickens. Each chicken is sold for $50, so the total cost is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 180 \\times 50 = 9000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chicken he took to the market for sale is \\(\\boxed{9000}\\).",
    "answer": "Isaias plans to sell 3/5*300 = <<3/5*300=180>>180 chickens from his farm.\nTo make his profit, Isaias sells all the chicken he took to the market for $50*180 = $<<50*180=9000>>9000\nThe price at which Isaias bought the chicken is $9000-$2000 = $<<9000-2000=7000>>7000.\n#### 7000"
