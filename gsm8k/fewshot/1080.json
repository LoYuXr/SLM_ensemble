    "question": "If every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, how many jellyfish would 5 springs working at the same rate create in 4 hours?",
    "completion": "To determine how many jellyfish 5 springs would create in 4 hours, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour:**\n   - Each spring creates a new jellyfish every second.\n   - Therefore, in one hour, one spring creates \\(1\\) jellyfish.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**\n   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per hour, in 4 hours, one spring will create \\(4\\) jellyfish.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**\n   - If one spring creates 4 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) jellyfish in 4 hours.\n\nThus, the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
    "answer": "Since an hour has 3600 seconds, if every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, it will create 4*3600 = <<4*3600=14400>>14400 jellyfish in four hours.\nFive springs working at the same rate will create 14400*5 =<<14400*5=72000>>72000 jellyfish in four hours.\n#### 72000"
