    "question": "Annabelle is saving for a phone that costs $400. She already has $80 in her savings. Her first job, where she earns $10 per hour, pays her for 20 hours of work. She is also paid for 15 hours of work at her second job, where she earns $5 an hour. In dollars, how much money does Annabelle still need to save?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Annabelle still needs to save for the phone, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will earn from both jobs and then subtract the amount she already has saved.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job:\n- She earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work.\n- The total earnings from the first job are \\( 10 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 20 \\text{ hours} = 200 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her second job:\n- She earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work.\n- The total earnings from the second job are \\( 5 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 15 \\text{ hours} = 75 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\nNow, let's find the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from both jobs:\n- The total earnings from both jobs are \\( 200 \\text{ dollars} + 75 \\text{ dollars} = 275 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\nAnnabelle already has $80 in her savings. To find out how much more money she needs to save, we subtract the amount she already has from the total amount she will earn:\n- The amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is \\( 275 \\text{ dollars} - 80 \\text{ dollars} = 195 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\nTherefore, Annabelle still needs to save \\(\\boxed{195}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Subtracting Annabelle\u2019s initial savings shows that she still needs to save $400 \u2013 $80 = $<<400-80=320>>320.\nFrom her first job, she earns $10 * 20 hours = $<<10*20=200>>200.\nFrom her second job, she earns $5 * 15 hours = $<<5*15=75>>75.\nShe therefore still needs to save $320 \u2013 $200 \u2013 $75 = $<<320-200-75=45>>45.\n#### 45"
