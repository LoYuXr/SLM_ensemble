    "question": "Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at an interest rate of 10%. She has to pay an equal amount every month. How much does she have to pay per month?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total interest paid over the five months:**\n   The interest rate is 10%, so the total interest paid over five months is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Interest} = \\text{Principal} \\times \\text{Interest Rate} \\times \\text{Number of Months}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Interest} = 3650 \\times 0.10 \\times 5 = 1825\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the monthly payment:**\n   Since the total interest paid over five months is $1825, the monthly payment is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly Payment} = \\frac{\\text{Total Interest}}{\\text{Number of Months}}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly Payment} = \\frac{1825}{5} = 365\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Karan has to pay \\(\\boxed{365}\\) dollars per month.",
    "answer": "Karan's interest is $3,650 \u00d7 0.1 = $<<3650*0.1=365>>365.\nIn total Karan has to pay $3650 + $365 = $<<3650+365=4015>>4015.\nEvery month she has to pay $4015 / 5 = $<<4015/5=803>>803.\n#### 803"
