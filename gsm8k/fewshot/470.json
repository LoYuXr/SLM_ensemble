    "question": "Theo bought a pen for $2 and a piece of paper that cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. She gave the cashier $10. What is the amount of change Theo received?",
    "completion": "To determine the amount of change Theo received, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the piece of paper.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the pen and the paper.\n3. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money Theo gave to the cashier.\n\nLet's start with the cost of the paper. The problem states that the piece of paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Since the pen costs $2, we can calculate the cost of the paper as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of the paper} = 3 \\times 2 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the pen and the paper:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 2 + 5 = 7\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money Theo gave to the cashier:\n\\[\n\\text{Change} = 10 - 7 = 3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of change Theo received is \\boxed{3}.",
    "answer": "Three times the cost of pen is $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.\nThe cost of paper is $6 - $1 = $<<6-1=5>>5.\nThe total cost for the pen and paper is $2 + $5 = $<<2+5=7>>7.\nTheo received $10 - $7 = $<<10-7=3>>3 change.\n#### 3"
