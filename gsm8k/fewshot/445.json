    "question": "Michael is racing his horse and notices that for every mile the horse runs, he eats 1/2 a bail of hay. A bail of hay costs $3. If his horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, and Michael has six 5 dollar bills, how much change does he have after he buys the hay?",
    "completion": "To determine how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the distance Michael's horse runs in miles:**\n   - The horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH).\n   - The horse runs for 30 minutes.\n   - Convert 30 minutes to hours: \\( \\frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \\) hours.\n   - Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = \\( 32 \\, \\text{MPH} \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 16 \\, \\text{miles} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the amount of hay Michael's horse eats in 1 mile:**\n   - For every mile the horse runs, he eats \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) bail of hay.\n   - Therefore, for 16 miles, he eats \\( 16 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 8 \\) bails of hay.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the hay:**\n   - Each bail of hay costs $3.\n   - Total cost = \\( 8 \\, \\text{bails} \\times 3 \\, \\text{dollars/bail} = 24 \\, \\text{dollars} \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:**\n   - Michael has six 5 dollar bills.\n   - Total amount of money Michael has = \\( 6 \\times 5 \\, \\text{dollars} = 30 \\, \\text{dollars} \\).\n   - Change = Total amount of money - Total cost of the hay = \\( 30 \\, \\text{dollars} - 24 \\, \\text{dollars} = 6 \\, \\text{dollars} \\).\n\nTherefore, Michael has $6 in change after buying the hay.",
    "answer": "The horse runs 16 miles because 32 x (30/60) = <<32*(30/60)=16>>16\nThe horse needs to eat 8 bails of hay because 16 x .5 = <<16*.5=8>>8\nThe hay will cost $24 because 8 x $3 = <<8*3=24>>24\nMichael has $30 because 6 x $5 = <<6*5=30>>30\nMichael has $6 in change because $30 - $24 = $<<30-24=6>>6\n#### 6"
