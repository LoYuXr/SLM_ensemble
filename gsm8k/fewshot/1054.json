    "question": "My kitchen floor has a total area of 200 SqFt. I want to install new square floor tiles that cost $12 each, and each tile side is 1ft in length. How much will it cost me to renovate my kitchen floor?",
    "completion": "To calculate the cost of installing new square floor tiles, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the area of the kitchen floor:**\n   The area of the kitchen floor is given as 200 square feet (SqFt).\n\n2. **Determine the cost per square foot:**\n   Each square foot of floor area costs $12.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   Multiply the total area of the kitchen floor by the cost per square foot.\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Area of the Kitchen Floor} \\times \\text{Cost per Square Foot} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = 200 \\, \\text{SqFt} \\times \\$12/\\text{SqFt} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = \\$2400 \\]\n\nSo, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor would be $2400.",
    "answer": "The total area of a square tile is length * width or 1*1 = <<1*1=1>>1 SqFt\nIf the kitchen has a total area of 200 SqFt then my kitchen needs 200/1 = <<200/1=200>>200 square tiles\nIf each tile costs $12, then 200 square tiles will cost $12 * 200 = $<<12*200=2400>>2,400\n#### 2400"
