    "question": "Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris.  Kris kept 9 of the stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. How many stickers did Seth have in the beginning?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the total number of stickers Seth had initially as \\( S \\).\n\n1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Therefore, Luis received \\( \\frac{S}{2} \\) stickers.\n2. Luis then used half of the stickers he received, so he gave away \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{S}{2} = \\frac{S}{4} \\) stickers.\n3. The remaining stickers that Luis gave to Kris are \\( \\frac{S}{4} \\).\n4. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers Kris received is \\( 9 + 7 = 16 \\).\n\nSince the total number of stickers Kris received is 16, and we know that \\( \\frac{S}{4} \\) of the stickers must be 16, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{S}{4} = 16 \\]\n\nTo find \\( S \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[ S = 16 \\times 4 = 64 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of stickers Seth had in the beginning is \\( \\boxed{64} \\).",
    "answer": "Luis gave 9 + 7 = <<9+7=16>>16 stickers to Kris.\nLuis gave half of his stickers to Kris which means that he had 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 stickers.\nSeth had 32 x 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 stickers.\n#### 64"
