    "question": "Alisa biked 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. How many miles did Alisa and Stanley bike in total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each person biked separately and then sum these distances.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:\nAlisa's speed is 12 miles per hour, and she biked for 4.5 hours.\n\\[\n\\text{Distance Alisa biked} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 12 \\, \\text{miles per hour} \\times 4.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 54 \\, \\text{miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:\nStanley's speed is 10 miles per hour, and he biked for 2.5 hours.\n\\[\n\\text{Distance Stanley biked} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 10 \\, \\text{miles per hour} \\times 2.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 25 \\, \\text{miles}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance biked:\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = \\text{Distance Alisa biked} + \\text{Distance Stanley biked} = 54 \\, \\text{miles} + 25 \\, \\text{miles} = 79 \\, \\text{miles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is \\boxed{79} miles.",
    "answer": "Alisa = 12 * 4.5 = <<12*4.5=54>>54 miles\nStanley = 10 * 2.5 = <<10*2.5=25>>25 miles\n54 + 25 = <<54+25=79>>79 miles\nTogether, Alisa and Stanley biked for 79 miles.\n#### 79"
