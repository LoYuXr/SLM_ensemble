    "question": "A phone tree is used to contact families and relatives of Ali's deceased coworker. Ali decided to call 3 families. Then each family calls 3 other families, and so on. How many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls?",
    "completion": "To determine how many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to understand the pattern of the contact process. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Contact**: Ali calls 3 families.\n2. **First Round**: Each of the 3 families calls 3 other families. So, the total number of families contacted in the first round is \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n3. **Second Round**: Each of the 9 families calls 3 other families. So, the total number of families contacted in the second round is \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\).\n4. **Third Round**: Each of the 27 families calls 3 other families. So, the total number of families contacted in the third round is \\(27 \\times 3 = 81\\).\n5. **Fourth Round**: Each of the 81 families calls 3 other families. So, the total number of families contacted in the fourth round is \\(81 \\times 3 = 243\\).\n\nThus, the total number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is \\(\\boxed{243}\\).",
    "answer": "In the first round, there are 3 families called.\nIn the second round, there are 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 families called.\nIn the third round, there are 9 x 3 = <<9*3=27>>27 families called.\nIn the fourth round, there are 27 x 3 = <<27*3=81>>81 families called.\n#### 81"
