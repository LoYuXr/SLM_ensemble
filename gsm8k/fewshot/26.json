    "question": "Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. One pair of shorts costs $16.50. One pair of pants costs $22.50 and one pair of shoes costs $42. How many dollars did Mishka spend on all the clothing items?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and then sum these costs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:\n- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.\n- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the shorts is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 16.50 = 49.50\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the pants:\n- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.\n- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the pants is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 22.50 = 67.50\n  \\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:\n- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.\n- Each pair of shoes costs $42.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the shoes is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 42 = 126\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the costs of all the clothing items:\n\\[\n49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 233\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{233}\n\\]",
    "answer": "3 * (16.50 + 22.50 + 42) = $<<3*(16.50+22.50+42)=243>>243\nMishka spent $243 on clothing.\n#### 243"
