    "question": "Shiela bought five cell phones for $150 each for a 3-month installment. A 2% interest will be charged for each unit. How much will Shiela pay each month for 3 months?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones.\n2. Determine the total interest charged over the 3-month period.\n3. Calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones.**\n\nShiela bought five cell phones, each costing $150. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 150 = 750 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total interest charged over the 3-month period.**\n\nThe interest rate is 2% per unit. Since Shiela is buying five units, the total interest charged over 3 months is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 0.02 \\times 3 = 0.3 \\times 3 = 0.9 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month.**\n\nThe total amount Shiela will pay each month is the total cost of the cell phones minus the total interest charged:\n\\[ 750 - 0.9 = 749.1 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Shiela will pay each month for 3 months is:\n\\[ \\boxed{749.1} \\]",
    "answer": "A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.\nSo, each cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153.\nThe total amount to be paid for 5 cell phones is $153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.\nThus, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month.\n#### 255"
