    "question": "Jake is walking through the Museum of Entomology. He sees 80 spiders with 8 legs each, 90 insects with 6 legs each, and 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each. How many legs does Jake see total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs contributed by each type of insect and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Spiders:**\n   - Number of spiders: 80\n   - Legs per spider: 8\n   - Total legs from spiders: \\( 80 \\times 8 = 640 \\)\n\n2. **Insects:**\n   - Number of insects: 90\n   - Legs per insect: 6\n   - Total legs from insects: \\( 90 \\times 6 = 540 \\)\n\n3. **Mutant invertebrates:**\n   - Number of mutant invertebrates: 3\n   - Legs per mutant invertebrate: 10\n   - Total legs from mutant invertebrates: \\( 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\)\n\nNow, we sum up the legs from all the insects and spiders:\n\\[ 640 + 540 = 1180 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the legs from the mutant invertebrates:\n\\[ 1180 + 30 = 1210 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of legs Jake sees is \\(\\boxed{1210}\\).",
    "answer": "First find the total number of spider legs: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = <<80*8=640>>640 legs\nThen find the total number of insect legs: 90 spiders * 6 legs/spider = <<90*6=540>>540 legs\nThen find the total number of mutant invertebrate legs: 3 mutants * 10 legs/mutant = <<3*10=30>>30 legs\nThen add the number of each kind of leg to find the total he saw: 640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = <<640+540+30=1210>>1210 legs\n#### 1210"
