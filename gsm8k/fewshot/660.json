    "question": "Lee rears only sheep and geese on his farm.  If the total number of animal legs is 70, and the total number of animal heads is 20, how many sheep live on Lee's farm?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:\n\n- Let \\( S \\) be the number of sheep.\n- Let \\( G \\) be the number of geese.\n\nWe know two things:\n1. The total number of animal legs is 70.\n2. The total number of animal heads is 20.\n\nSince each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can write the first equation as:\n\\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \\]\n\nSince each animal has 1 head, we can write the second equation as:\n\\[ S + G = 20 \\]\n\nWe now have a system of linear equations:\n1. \\( 4S + 2G = 70 \\)\n2. \\( S + G = 20 \\)\n\nWe can simplify the first equation by dividing every term by 2:\n\\[ 2S + G = 35 \\]\n\nNow we have the simplified system:\n1. \\( 2S + G = 35 \\)\n2. \\( S + G = 20 \\)\n\nTo eliminate \\( G \\), we can subtract the second equation from the first:\n\\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \\]\n\\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \\]\n\\[ S = 15 \\]\n\nSo, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \\( \\boxed{15} \\).\n\nTo verify, we can substitute \\( S = 15 \\) back into the second equation to find \\( G \\):\n\\[ 15 + G = 20 \\]\n\\[ G = 5 \\]\n\nNow we check the total number of animal legs:\n\\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \\]\nThis confirms that our solution is correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is indeed \\( \\boxed{15} \\).",
    "answer": "Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.\nTherefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.\nThe animals have 2g + 4s = 70 legs.\nUsing the value of s above, 2g + 4(20-g) = 70.\n2g + 80 - 4g = 70.\n2g = 10.\nThere are therefore 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 geese.\nThere are 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 sheep remaining on the farm.\n#### 15"
