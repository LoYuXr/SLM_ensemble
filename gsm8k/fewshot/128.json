    "question": "Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of each type of fruit:\n1. The cost of a watermelon is given as 15$.\n2. The cost of a pepper is 15$.\n3. The cost of an orange is 5$ less than the cost of a watermelon. Therefore, the cost of an orange is:\n   \\[\n   15 - 5 = 10$$\n4. The cost of a watermelon is three times the cost of a pepper. Therefore, the cost of a pepper is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{15}{3} = 5$$\n5. The cost of an orange is 5$ less than the cost of a watermelon. Therefore, the cost of an orange is:\n   \\[\n   15 - 5 = 10$$\n6. The cost of a pepper is 5$ less than the cost of a watermelon. Therefore, the cost of a pepper is:\n   \\[\n   15 - 5 = 10$$\n7. The cost of a watermelon is 15$.\n8. The cost of a pepper is 5$.\n9. The cost of an orange is 10$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:\n- The total cost for 4 watermelons is:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 15 = 60$$\n- The total cost for 20 peppers is:\n  \\[\n  20 \\times 5 = 100$$\n- The total cost for 10 oranges is:\n  \\[\n  10 \\times 10 = 100$$\n- The total cost for all the fruits is:\n  \\[\n  60 + 100 + 100 = 260$\n- The total cost for all the fruits is also equal to the total cost for the watermelons, peppers, and oranges, which is 260$.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{260}\n\\]",
    "answer": "A watermelon costs three times what pepper costs, which is 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.\nAn orange price is 45 - 5= $<<45-5=40>>40.\nDillon buys four watermelons at a total cost of 45 * 4 = $<<45*4=180>>180.\nHe also purchases peppers at a total price of 20 * 15 = $<<20*15=300>>300.\nThe oranges cost him a total of 10 * 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.\nHe used a total of 400 + 300 + 180 = $<<400+300+180=880>>880.\n#### 880"
