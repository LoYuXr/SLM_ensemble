    "question": "Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total length of the flower bed:**\n   The flower bed is 111 feet long.\n\n2. **Determine the number of plants needed:**\n   Pat wants to fill the flower bed with plants that are 12 inches wide. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 12 inches is equivalent to 1 foot.\n   Therefore, each plant is 1 foot long.\n   Pat already owns 17 flowers, and each flower needs 1 foot of space.\n   So, the total number of plants needed is:\n   \\[\n   17 \\text{ flowers} \\times 1 \\text{ foot/flower} = 17 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of gaps between the plants:**\n   Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.\n   Therefore, the number of gaps between the plants is:\n   \\[\n   17 \\text{ plants} - 1 \\text{ plant} = 16 \\text{ gaps}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total length of the gaps:**\n   Each gap is 1.5 feet long.\n   Therefore, the total length of the gaps is:\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ gaps} \\times 1.5 \\text{ feet/gap} = 24 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total length of the flower bed:**\n   The total length of the flower bed is the sum of the length of the plants and the length of the gaps:\n   \\[\n   111 \\text{ feet} + 24 \\text{ feet} = 135 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total cost of the plants:**\n   Each flowering plant costs $6.\n   Therefore, the total cost for 17 plants is:\n   \\[\n   17 \\text{ plants} \\times 6 \\text{ dollars/plant} = 102 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{102}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Pat's flower bed is 111 feet / 1.5 feet per plant = <<111/1.5=74>>74 plants needed.\nPat needs to buy 74 plants - 17 plants = <<74-17=57>>57 plants needed to purchase.\nPat will spend 57 plants * $6 = $<<57*6=342>>342.\n#### 342"
