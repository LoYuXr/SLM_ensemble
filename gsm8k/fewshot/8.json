    "question": "John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph and then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home.  He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?",
    "completion": "To determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4-hour trip, we need to break down the journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.\n\n1. **First Segment:**\n   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.\n   - Distance covered in the first segment: \\( 60 \\text{ mph} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 180 \\text{ miles} \\).\n\n2. **Second Segment:**\n   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.\n   - Distance covered in the second segment: \\( 0 \\text{ mph} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 0 \\text{ miles} \\).\n\n3. **Third Segment:**\n   - John drives for the remaining 2 hours at a speed of 30 mph.\n   - Distance covered in the third segment: \\( 30 \\text{ mph} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 60 \\text{ miles} \\).\n\n4. **Fourth Segment:**\n   - John drives for the remaining 2 hours at a speed of 80 mph.\n   - Distance covered in the fourth segment: \\( 80 \\text{ mph} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 160 \\text{ miles} \\).\n\nNow, we sum up the distances covered in all segments:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ miles} + 0 \\text{ miles} + 60 \\text{ miles} + 160 \\text{ miles} = 400 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, John is 400 miles from home at the end of the 4-hour trip.",
    "answer": "When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home\nHe was only able to drive 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours in the first four hours\nIn half an hour he goes 30*.5=<<30*.5=15>>15 miles\nHe then drives another 2-.5=<<2-.5=1.5>>1.5 hours\nIn that time he goes 80*1.5=<<80*1.5=120>>120 miles\nSo he drove 120+15=<<120+15=135>>135 miles\nSo he is 180-135=<<180-135=45>>45 miles away from home\n#### 45"
