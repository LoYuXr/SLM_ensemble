    "question": "There are five phones on a phone plan. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. If the main phone plan costs $20, how much does the whole phone plan cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of the whole phone plan, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of the main phone.\n2. Determine the cost of each additional phone.\n3. Calculate the total cost of all five phones.\n\nGiven:\n- The main phone costs $20.\n- The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone.\n\nLet's denote the cost of each additional phone as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the main phone costs \\( 2x \\). Since the main phone costs $20, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 2x = 20 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ x = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\]\n\nSo, each additional phone costs $10. Now, we can calculate the total cost of all five phones:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of the main phone} + (\\text{Cost of each additional phone} \\times 5) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 20 + (10 \\times 5) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 20 + 50 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 70 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the whole phone plan is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).",
    "answer": "Each additional phone costs 20 / 2 = $<<20/2=10>>10.\nThus, the four additional phones cost 4 * 10 = $<<4*10=40>>40 in all.\nThus, the whole phone plan cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60.\n#### 60"
