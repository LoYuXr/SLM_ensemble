    "question": "Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters by her aunt to use for lunch. If she spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties, calculate the total amount of money she paid for the lunch.",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent on quarters.\n2. Calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent on twenties.\n3. Add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money spent.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of money Carrie spent on quarters. She has 140 quarters and she spent 3/5 of them. So, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount spent on quarters} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 140 = \\frac{3 \\times 140}{5} = \\frac{420}{5} = 84\n\\]\nSo, Carrie spent $84 on quarters.\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of money Carrie spent on twenties. She has 10 twenties and she spent 3/5 of them. So, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount spent on twenties} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 10 = \\frac{3 \\times 10}{5} = \\frac{30}{5} = 6\n\\]\nSo, Carrie spent $6 on twenties.\n\nNow, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money spent:\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount spent} = 84 + 6 = 90\n\\]\nTherefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is \\boxed{90}.",
    "answer": "Since she spent all the quarters, she paid her lunch partly by quarters totaling 140*$0.25 = $<<140*0.25=35>>35\nShe also used 3/5*10 = <<3/5*10=6>>6 of the twenties to pay for the lunch.\nThe total amount of the twenties that she used is 6*$20 = $<<6*20=120>>120\nShe spent $120+$35 = $<<120+35=155>>155 on the lunch.\n#### 155"
