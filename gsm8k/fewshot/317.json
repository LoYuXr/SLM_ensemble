    "question": "John fills a 6 foot by 4 foot pool that is 5 feet deep.  It cost $.1 per cubic foot to fill.  How much does it cost to fill?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the volume of the pool.\n2. Determine the cost to fill the pool based on the volume and the cost per cubic foot.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**\n\nThe pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \\( V \\) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:\n\\[ V = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nHere, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the height is 5 feet. So, the volume is:\n\\[ V = 6 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 120 \\text{ cubic feet} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost to fill the pool.**\n\nThe cost to fill the pool is $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \\( C \\) is:\n\\[ C = 120 \\times 0.1 = 12 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the cost to fill the pool is:\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]",
    "answer": "The pool has a base of 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24 square feet\nSo its volume was 24*5=<<24*5=120>>120 cubic feet\nSo it cost 120*.1=$<<120*.1=12>>12 to fill the pool\n#### 12"
