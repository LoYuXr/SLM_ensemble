    "question": "Jon runs a triathlon.  It takes him 40 minutes for the swim, an hour and 20 minutes for the bike ride and 50 minutes for the run.  Compared to Jon, James finishes the swim 10% faster but takes 5 minutes longer on the bike.  If Jon won by 10 minutes, how long did it take James to do the run?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it took James to complete the run, we need to first calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon and then use that information to find out how long it took James.\n\n1. **Calculate the total time for Jon's triathlon:**\n   - Swim: 40 minutes\n   - Bike ride: 60 minutes (1 hour and 20 minutes)\n   - Run: 50 minutes\n\n   Adding these times together:\n   \\[\n   40 + 60 + 50 = 150 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the time it took James to complete the triathlon:**\n   - Jon finishes the swim 10% faster than James.\n   - Jon takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than James.\n   - Jon finishes the bike ride 5 minutes faster than James.\n\n   Let \\( t \\) be the time it took James to complete the bike ride. Then:\n   \\[\n   t + 5 = 60 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   t - 5 = 50 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n   Solving these equations:\n   \\[\n   t + 5 = 60 \\implies t = 60 - 5 = 55 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   t - 5 = 50 \\implies t = 50 + 5 = 55 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n   Both equations confirm that \\( t = 55 \\) minutes.\n\n3. **Calculate the total time for James' triathlon:**\n   - Swim: 40 minutes\n   - Bike ride: 55 minutes\n   - Run: 50 minutes\n\n   Adding these times together:\n   \\[\n   40 + 55 + 50 = 145 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how long it took James to complete the run:**\n   - James finishes the run 10 minutes faster than Jon.\n   - Therefore, the time it took James to complete the run is:\n   \\[\n   145 - 10 = 135 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, it took James \\(\\boxed{135}\\) minutes to complete the run.",
    "answer": "Jon did the bike ride in 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes\nSo his total time was 40+80+50=<<40+80+50=170>>170 minutes\nJames finished the swim 40*.1=<<40*.1=4>>4 minutes faster\nSo he finished the swim in 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 minutes\nHe finished the bike ride in 80+5=<<80+5=85>>85 minutes\nJames' total time was 170+10=<<170+10=180>>180\nSo it took him 180-85-36=<<180-85-36=59>>59 minutes to do the run\n#### 59"
