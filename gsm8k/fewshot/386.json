    "question": "To have the car for the weekend, Wilson's report card needs to show that he received 80 or higher in his math class.  His math grade is calculated by the average of 5 test scores.  On those tests, he received: 65, 94, 81, 86 and 74.  What is his current math grade?",
    "completion": "To determine Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his five test scores. The formula for the average is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of all scores}}{\\text{Number of scores}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of his test scores:\n\n\\[\n65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74\n\\]\n\nAdding these scores step by step:\n\n\\[\n65 + 94 = 159\n\\]\n\\[\n159 + 81 = 240\n\\]\n\\[\n240 + 86 = 326\n\\]\n\\[\n326 + 74 = 400\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of his test scores is 400.\n\nNext, we divide this sum by the number of tests, which is 5:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{400}{5} = 80\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.",
    "answer": "He received 65, 94, 81, 86 and a 74 on his 5 math tests so that's 65+94+81+86+74 = <<400=400>>400\nHis math grade is calculated by the average test grade on his 5 tests so his math grade is 400/5 = <<400/5=80>>80\n#### 80"
