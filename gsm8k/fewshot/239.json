    "question": "The number of students in a school hall was 1000. The hall had 3 entrances A, B, and C which also served as the exits. If after a meeting 30% of the students went out of the building through exit A, 3/5 of the remaining went out through exit B, and the rest went out through exit C, calculate the number of students who went out through exit C.",
    "completion": "To determine the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the given percentages step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of students**: 1000\n\n2. **Students going out through exit A**: 30% of the students went out through exit A.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Students going out through exit A} = 0.30 \\times 1000 = 300\n   \\]\n\n3. **Remaining students after exit A**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700\n   \\]\n\n4. **Students going out through exit B**: \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of the remaining students went out through exit B.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Students going out through exit B} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 700 = 420\n   \\]\n\n5. **Remaining students after exit B**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining students} = 700 - 420 = 280\n   \\]\n\n6. **Students going out through exit C**: The rest of the students went out through exit C.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Students going out through exit C} = 280\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of students who went out through exit C is \\(\\boxed{280}\\).",
    "answer": "The number of students who went out through exit A is 30/100%1000 = 300 students.\nThe number of students who didn't use exit A is 1000-300 = <<1000-300=700>>700\n3/5 of the students used exit B, a total of 3/5*700 = <<3/5*700=420>>420 students.\nIf 420 of the remaining students who didn't use exit A used exit B, the number who used exit C is 700-420 = 280 students.\n#### 280"
