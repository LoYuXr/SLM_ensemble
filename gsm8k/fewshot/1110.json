    "question": "Although Soledad works in a windowless office, she loves the outdoors. She will be on vacation for the entire month of June and cannot wait to hike 9,300 miles within that month. She is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. How many more miles per day must Soledad hike to complete her journey on time?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of miles Soledad needs to hike in June.\n2. Determine the total number of miles Soledad has already hiked in June.\n3. Calculate the number of additional miles Soledad needs to hike.\n4. Determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete the remaining miles in June.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of miles Soledad needs to hike in June. Since she will be on vacation for the entire month of June and she cannot wait to hike 9,300 miles, she will need to hike 9,300 miles in June.\n\nNext, let's determine the total number of miles Soledad has already hiked in June. Since she walks twice a day and covers 125 miles each time, the total number of miles she has already hiked is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 125 = 250 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of additional miles Soledad needs to hike. The number of additional miles is:\n\\[ 9300 - 250 = 9050 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTo find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we divide the number of additional miles by the number of days in June (which is 30 days):\n\\[ \\frac{9050}{30} = 301.6667 \\text{ miles per day} \\]\n\nSince Soledad cannot hike a fraction of a mile per day, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, Soledad must hike 302 miles per day to complete her journey on time.\n\nSo, the number of additional miles per day Soledad must hike is:\n\\[ \\boxed{302} \\]",
    "answer": "June has 30 days, so Soledad must hike 9,300 miles / 30 days = <<9300/30=310>>310 miles/day\nInitially, she wanted to hike 2 times/day * 125 miles/time = <<2*125=250>>250 miles/day\nTo complete her journey, she must increase her hike by 310 miles/day - 250 miles/day = 60 miles/day\n#### 60"
