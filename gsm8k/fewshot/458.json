    "question": "Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?",
    "completion": "To determine the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of puppies.\n2. Determine the number of puppies with spots.\n3. Calculate the percentage of puppies with spots.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of puppies:\nJennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. Therefore, the total number of puppies is:\n\\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these puppies have spots. We know that 3 of Jennifer's puppies have spots and 4 of Brandon's puppies have spots. Therefore, the total number of puppies with spots is:\n\\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage of puppies with spots. The percentage is given by the formula:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{\\text{number of puppies with spots}}{\\text{total number of puppies}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{7}{20} \\right) \\times 100 = 35\\% \\]\n\nSo, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]",
    "answer": "First find the total number of puppies: 8 puppies + 12 puppies = <<8+12=20>>20 puppies\nThen find the total number of puppies with spots: 3 puppies + 4 puppies = <<3+4=7>>7 puppies\nThen divide the number of spotted puppies by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of puppies with spots: 7 puppies / 20 puppies * 100% = 35%\n#### 35"
