    "question": "James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week.  If he runs 10 miles an hour how many hours does he run a week?",
    "completion": "To determine how many hours James runs a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance James runs in a week.\n2. Convert the total distance from miles to hours.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance James runs in a week. He runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. So, the total distance in miles is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 60 \\text{ miles/week} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the total distance from miles to hours. We know that James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. Therefore, the total time he spends running in a week is:\n\\[ \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{10 \\text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, the total number of hours James runs a week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]",
    "answer": "He runs 5*12=<<5*12=60>>60 miles a week\nThat means he runs 60/10=<<60/10=6>>6 hours a week\n#### 6"
