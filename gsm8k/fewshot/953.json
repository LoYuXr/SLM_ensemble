    "question": "Kim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room. Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am.  Also, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?",
    "completion": "To determine how many minutes Kim slept on the day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total sleep time for the day:**\n   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.\n   - She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom.\n   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:05 a.m.\n\n2. **Calculate the total sleep time for the day:**\n   - From 10 p.m. to 5:05 a.m. is 5 hours and 5 minutes.\n   - Convert 5 hours and 5 minutes to minutes: \\(5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} + 5 \\text{ minutes} = 300 \\text{ minutes} + 5 \\text{ minutes} = 305 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\n3. **Determine the sleep time for the day:**\n   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.\n   - She woke up at 5:05 a.m.\n   - Therefore, she slept from 10 p.m. to 5:05 a.m., which is 5 hours and 5 minutes.\n\n4. **Calculate the sleep time for the day:**\n   - From 10 p.m. to 5:05 a.m. is 5 hours and 5 minutes.\n   - Subtract the sleep time for the day from the total sleep time for the day: \\(305 \\text{ minutes} - 5 \\text{ hours and 5 minutes} = 290 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\nThus, Kim slept for \\(\\boxed{290}\\) minutes that day.",
    "answer": "Out of 24 hours in a day, 10 pm represents 22 hours.\nUntil 12 p.m. or 24 hours, Kim slept 24 - 22 = <<24-22=2>>2 hours.\nIn total, Kim usually sleeps 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 hours a day.\nIn minutes, Kim usually sleeps 8 * 60 = <<8*60=480>>480 minutes\nKim was sleepwalking for a total of 38 - 15 = <<38-15=23>>23 minutes.\nWithin her usual sleep routine, Kim was sleepwalking or awake a total of 23 + 5 =<<23+5=28>>28 minutes.\nOn that day, Kim slept in her bed for 480 - 28 = <<480-28=452>>452 minutes.\n#### 452"
