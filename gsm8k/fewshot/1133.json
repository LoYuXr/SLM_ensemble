    "question": "Grandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 2 miles of walking on the beach and 1 mile of walking on the sidewalk.  On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach.  If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it takes Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate the time spent on each segment of the walk.\n\n1. **Determine the time spent on the beach:**\n   Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach at a rate of 3 miles per day. Therefore, the time spent on the beach is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time on the beach} = \\frac{2 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ miles/day}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the time spent on the sidewalk:**\n   Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at a rate of 3 miles per day. Therefore, the time spent on the sidewalk is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time on the sidewalk} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{3 \\text{ miles/day}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the time spent on the remaining distance:**\n   The remaining distance is 3 miles - 2 miles - 1 mile = 0 miles. Since the remaining distance is zero, the time spent on the remaining distance is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time on the remaining distance} = 0 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total time spent on the entire walk:**\n   The total time spent on the entire walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach, the time spent on the sidewalk, and the time spent on the remaining distance:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ days} + \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ days} + 0 \\text{ days} = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = 1 \\text{ day}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert the total time from days to minutes:**\n   Since there are 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 1 day to minutes:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ day} = 1 \\times 24 \\times 60 = 1440 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is \\(\\boxed{1",
    "answer": "On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.\nTo walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 50"
