    "question": "Micheal loves riding a bike. He rode it at least 5 times a week and makes 25 kilometers each time. He did that for four weeks, and then he decided, to ride the bike only 2 times a week, but for 60 kilometers each time, and he did that for 3 weeks. How many kilometers did Micheal do in total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance he rode in the first four weeks and the distance he rode in the next three weeks separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Micheal rode in the first four weeks:\n- He rode the bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks.\n- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.\n- Therefore, the total distance for the first four weeks is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\text{ times/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} \\times 25 \\text{ kilometers/time} = 5 \\times 4 \\times 25 = 500 \\text{ kilometers}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance Micheal rode in the next three weeks:\n- He rode the bike 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time.\n- Therefore, the total distance for the next three weeks is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ times/week} \\times 60 \\text{ kilometers/time} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 2 \\times 60 \\times 3 = 360 \\text{ kilometers}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the distances from both periods to find the total distance Micheal rode:\n\\[\n500 \\text{ kilometers} + 360 \\text{ kilometers} = 860 \\text{ kilometers}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of kilometers Micheal rode is \\(\\boxed{860}\\).",
    "answer": "In the first part, Micheal did 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 kilometers every week.\nHe did that for four weeks, which means he made during that time 125 * 4 = <<125*4=500>>500 kilometers.\nAfter that, he made 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 kilometers a week.\nAnd Micheal did that for three weeks, so he rode 120 * 3 = <<120*3=360>>360 kilometers during that time.\nIn total Micheal did 500 + 360 = <<500+360=860>>860 kilometers.\n#### 860"
