    "question": "Brian's friend Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does.  If Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made, how many does Bobby have?",
    "completion": "To determine how many video games Bobby has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of video games Brian has before losing any.\n2. Use the information about Bobby's video games to find out how many Bobby has.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many video games Brian has before losing any. Brian has 20 video games, but he lost 5 right before the comparison was made. Therefore, the number of video games Brian has before losing any is:\n\\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. The problem states that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does. So, we calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has:\n\\[ 3 \\times 15 = 45 \\]\n\nThen, we subtract 5 from this result to find out how many video games Bobby has:\n\\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of video games Bobby has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",
    "answer": "If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 video games\nBrian has 15 video games, so if Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many as Brian does we must first perform 15*3=45\nWe then subtract 5 from the previous total for 45-5=40 games in total.\n#### 40"
