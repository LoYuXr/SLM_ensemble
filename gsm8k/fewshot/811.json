    "question": "Felix notices that kids in the neighborhood are always getting things stuck in trees. Since he is an expert tree climber, he decided to start charging kids to get their stuff out. He charges based on how high he has to climb. Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25. During the week he made $105. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?",
    "completion": "To determine how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of branches climbed:**\n   Felix made $105, and each branch costs $0.25. Therefore, the total number of branches climbed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total branches} = \\frac{\\text{Total money made}}{\\text{Cost per branch}} = \\frac{105}{0.25} = 420\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the average number of branches climbed per day:**\n   Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average branches per day} = \\frac{\\text{Total branches}}{\\text{Number of days}} = \\frac{420}{7} = 60\n   \\]\n\nThus, on average, Felix climbed \\(\\boxed{60}\\) branches per day.",
    "answer": "He climbed 420 branches in total because 105 / .25 = <<105/.25=420>>420\nHe climbed on average 60 branches a day because 420 / 7 = <<420/7=60>>60\n#### 60"
