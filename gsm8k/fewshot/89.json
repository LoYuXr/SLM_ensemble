    "question": "Christina is planning a birthday party and needs .75 gift bags per invited guest, because 1/4 of attendees don't show up. She invited 16 friends. Gift bags are $2 each. How much will she spend?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Christina will spend on the gift bags, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of guests invited.\n2. Determine the number of guests who will not show up.\n3. Calculate the number of guests who will show up.\n4. Find out how many gift bags are needed.\n5. Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of guests invited.\n   Christina invited 16 friends, and 1/4 of the attendees don't show up.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of guests who show up} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, 4 guests will show up.\n\n2. Determine the number of guests who will not show up.\n   Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, the number of guests who will not show up is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of guests who don't show up} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, 4 guests will not show up.\n\n3. Calculate the number of guests who will show up.\n   The number of guests who will show up is the total number of guests minus the number of guests who don't show up:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of guests who show up} = 16 - 4 = 12\n   \\]\n\n4. Find out how many gift bags are needed.\n   Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 12 \\times 2 = 24\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Christina will spend is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
    "answer": "She needs 12 gift bags because 16 x .75 = <<16*.75=12>>12\nShe will spend $24 because 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24\n#### 24"
