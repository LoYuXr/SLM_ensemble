    "question": "Bubbles collects stuffed animals. She has three stuffed puppies, five stuffed koalas, two stuffed zebras and four stuffed frogs. If she wants to buy enough stuffed goats, such that the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all of her stuffed animals, how many stuffed goats should she buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how many stuffed goats Qwen should buy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of stuffed animals.\n2. Determine the number of stuffed goats needed to achieve a 30% share of the total stuffed animals.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals:\n- Bubbles has 3 stuffed puppies.\n- Bubbles has 5 stuffed koalas.\n- Bubbles has 2 stuffed zebras.\n- Bubbles has 4 stuffed frogs.\n\nAdding these together, we get:\n\\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \\text{ stuffed animals} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many stuffed goats should be bought to get a 30% share of the total stuffed animals. Since the total number of stuffed animals is 14, we calculate 30% of 14:\n\\[ 0.30 \\times 14 = 4.2 \\]\n\nSince the number of stuffed goats must be a whole number, we round 4.2 to the nearest whole number, which is 4. Therefore, Qwen should buy \\(\\boxed{4}\\) stuffed goats.",
    "answer": "Let x = the number of stuffed goats.\nThe current number of stuffed animals are (puppies + koalas + zebras + frogs) or 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = <<3+5+2+4=14>>14 stuffed animals total.\nTake the total stuffed animals, add x and divide by the number of stuffed goats to get to 30% or x / (14 + x) = .3\nCross multiply to get x = 0.42 + .3x\nSubtract .3 x from each side, .7x = 0.42\nBubbles needs x = <<6=6>>6 goats added.\n#### 6"
