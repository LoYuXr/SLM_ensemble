    "question": "Mason likes eating carrots. If he eats 4 carrots each on weekdays and 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, how many carrots does he eat a week?",
    "completion": "To determine how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.\n\n1. Calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays (Monday to Friday):\n   - He eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays.\n   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.\n   - So, the total number of carrots eaten on weekdays is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ carrots/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 20 \\text{ carrots}\n     \\]\n\n2. Calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on Saturday and Sunday:\n   - He eats 5 carrots each day on Saturday and Sunday.\n   - There are 2 days in a week that he eats carrots.\n   - So, the total number of carrots eaten on Saturday and Sunday is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ carrots/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 10 \\text{ carrots}\n     \\]\n\n3. Add the number of carrots eaten on weekdays and on Saturday and Sunday to get the total number of carrots eaten in a week:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ carrots} + 10 \\text{ carrots} = 30 \\text{ carrots}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
    "answer": "He would eat 4 x 5 =<<4*5=20>>20 on weekdays.\nHe would eat 5 x 2= <<5*2=10>>10 over weekends.\nSo he would eat\t 20 + 10\t= <<20+10=30>>30 a week\n#### 30"
