    "question": "The recent floods in Mamou\u2019s country have left many families without food or shelter. To help, Mamou has volunteered to distribute 1,360 meals to the affected families. She gave out 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday. How many meals does she have left to distribute?",
    "completion": "To determine how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of meals distributed so far.\n2. Subtract the total number of meals distributed from the initial number of meals she volunteered to distribute.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of meals distributed:\n- On Friday, she distributed 64 meals.\n- On Saturday, she distributed 30 meals.\n- On Sunday, she distributed 48 meals.\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[ 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 \\]\n\nSo, Mamou has distributed a total of 142 meals so far.\n\nNext, we subtract the total number of meals distributed from the initial number of meals she volunteered to distribute:\n- She initially volunteered to distribute 1,360 meals.\n\nSubtracting the total number of meals distributed:\n\\[ 1360 - 142 = 1218 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is \\(\\boxed{1218}\\).",
    "answer": "On Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Mamou distributed a total of 64 meals + 30 meals + 48 meals = <<64+30+48=142>>142 meals\nThe remaining meals are 1,360 meals - 142 meals = <<1360-142=1218>>1,218 meals\n#### 1218"
