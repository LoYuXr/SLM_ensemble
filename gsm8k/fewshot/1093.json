    "question": "Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. How much will it cost to paint the room?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost of painting the room, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total area of the walls.\n2. Determine how many gallons of paint are needed.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the paint.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total area of the walls.**\n\nThe room has four walls: two north-south walls and two east-west walls. The area of each wall is the product of its length and width.\n\n- The area of the north-south walls is \\(10 \\text{ feet} \\times 8 \\text{ feet} = 80 \\text{ square feet}\\).\n- The area of the east-west walls is \\(5 \\text{ feet} \\times 8 \\text{ feet} = 40 \\text{ square feet}\\).\n\nSo, the total area of the walls is \\(80 \\text{ square feet} + 40 \\text{ square feet} = 120 \\text{ square feet}\\).\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many gallons of paint are needed.**\n\nEach gallon of paint covers 20 square feet. Therefore, the number of gallons needed is the total area of the walls divided by the coverage area per gallon.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of gallons} = \\frac{120 \\text{ square feet}}{20 \\text{ square feet per gallon}} = 6 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the paint.**\n\nEach gallon of paint costs $12. Therefore, the total cost is the number of gallons multiplied by the cost per gallon.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 6 \\text{ gallons} \\times 12 \\text{ dollars per gallon} = 72 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSo, the cost to paint the room is \\(\\boxed{72}\\).",
    "answer": "The north and south walls are 80 square feet each because 10 x 8 = <<10*8=80>>80\nThe east and west walls are 40 square feet because 5 x 8 = <<5*8=40>>40\nThe south and north walls total 160 square feet because 80 x 2 = <<80*2=160>>160\nThe East and west walls total 80 square feet because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80\nAll the walls total 240 square feet because 160 + 80 = <<160+80=240>>240\nHe will need 12 gallons of paint because 240 / 20 = <<240/20=12>>12\nIt will cost $144 because 12 x 12 = <<12*12=144>>144\n#### 144"
