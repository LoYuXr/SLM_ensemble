    "question": "Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike trip. He first stopped after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. How many miles did he travel between his first and second stops?",
    "completion": "To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total distance of the trip.\n2. Determine the distance of the first stop.\n3. Determine the distance of the second stop.\n4. Calculate the distance between the first and second stops.\n\nThe total distance of the trip is 60 miles. Henry first stopped after 20 miles and then stopped 15 miles before the end of the trip. Therefore, the distance between the first and second stops is the difference between the total distance of the trip and the distance of the first stop.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step:\n\n1. The total distance of the trip is 60 miles.\n2. The distance of the first stop is 20 miles.\n3. The distance of the second stop is 15 miles.\n4. The distance between the first and second stops is \\(60 - 20 - 15 = 25\\) miles.\n\nSo, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
    "answer": "He traveled 20 miles + 15 miles = <<20+15=35>>35 miles not counting the distance between stops.\nHenry traveled 60 miles - 35 miles = <<60-35=25>>25 miles between his first and second stop.\n#### 25"
