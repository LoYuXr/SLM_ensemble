    "question": "Janet goes to the mall and spends $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 each for movie tickets for herself and her younger sister, and $8.50 on a bracelet. If her parents gave her $40, how many dollars does she have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Janet has left after her purchases, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount spent on ice cream.\n2. Calculate the total amount spent on movie tickets.\n3. Add the amounts spent on ice cream, movie tickets, and the bracelet.\n4. Subtract the total amount spent from the $40 Janet received from her parents.\n\nLet's start with the ice cream:\nJanet spent $3.50 on ice cream.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount spent on movie tickets:\nShe bought movie tickets for herself and her younger sister, so that's $7.50 each. Since she has two tickets, the total is:\n\\[ 7.50 \\times 2 = 15.00 \\]\n\nNow, let's add the amounts spent on ice cream, movie tickets, and the bracelet:\n\\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \\]\n\nJanet's parents gave her $40.00. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount her parents gave her:\n\\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Janet has left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{13.00} \\]",
    "answer": "First calculate the cost of the movie tickets by multiplying the price per ticket by 2: $7.50 * 2 = $<<7.5*2=15.00>>15.00\nThen add up all the money Janet spent: $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $<<3.5+15+8.5=27.00>>27.00\nNow subtract Janet's spending from the initial amount of money she had: $40.00 - $27.00 = $<<40-27=13.00>>13.00\n#### 13"
