    "question": "Emily has 4 kids named Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. If James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey, how old is Jackson?",
    "completion": "To determine Jackson's age, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of Emily's children based on the information provided:\n\n1. Emily has 4 kids named Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James.\n2. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.\n3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.\n4. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey.\n\nLet's denote the ages of the children as follows:\n- Amy's age: \\( A \\)\n- Jackson's age: \\( J \\)\n- Corey's age: \\( C \\)\n- James's age: \\( J \\)\n\nFrom the information given:\n1. \\( A = J + 5 \\)\n2. \\( A = C - 2 \\)\n3. \\( J = C - 1 \\)\n4. \\( J = 10 \\)\n\nFirst, we can find Corey's age by substituting \\( J = 10 \\) into the equation \\( J = C - 1 \\):\n\\[ 10 = C - 1 \\]\n\\[ C = 11 \\]\n\nNow that we know Corey's age is 11, we can find Jackson's age using the equation \\( A = C - 2 \\):\n\\[ A = 11 - 2 \\]\n\\[ A = 9 \\]\n\nSo, Jackson is 9 years old.",
    "answer": "James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = <<10+1=11>>11 years old\nAmy is 2 years younger than Corey so is 11 - 2 = 9 years old\nAmy is also 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = <<9-5=4>>4 years old\n#### 4"
