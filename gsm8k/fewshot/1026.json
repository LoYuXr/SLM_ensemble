    "question": "One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe and 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes mine in a month with 30 days?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe:**\n   - One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.\n   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ pounds/day} \\times 2 = 24 \\text{ pounds/day}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe:**\n   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe:\n     \\[\n     24 \\text{ pounds/day} \\times 1.5 = 36 \\text{ pounds/day}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of ore one dwarf can mine in a month with 30 days:**\n   - One dwarf can mine 24 pounds of ore per day.\n   - In a month with 30 days:\n     \\[\n     24 \\text{ pounds/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 720 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days:**\n   - There are 40 dwarves.\n   - Each dwarf mines 720 pounds of ore in a month:\n     \\[\n     40 \\text{ dwarves} \\times 720 \\text{ pounds/dwarf} = 28800 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days is \\(\\boxed{28800}\\) pounds.",
    "answer": "First find how much ore a dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe: 12 pounds/day * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pounds/day\nThen multiply that amount by 150% to find how much a dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe: 24 pounds/day * 150% = <<24*150*.01=36>>36 pounds/day\nThen multiply the amount one dwarf can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe by the number of dwarves: 36 pounds/day/dwarf * 40 dwarves = <<36*40=1440>>1440 pounds/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = <<1440*30=43200>>43200 pounds/day\n#### 43200"
