    "question": "Scarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale.  At the pet store, she bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each and 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 apiece.  She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each and she needed fish food that cost $2.00.  How much did she spend?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Scarlett spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item she bought and then sum these costs.\n\n1. **Cost of rocks:**\n   - She bought 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each.\n   - Total cost for rocks = \\( 2 \\times 2.50 = 5.00 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Cost of coral:**\n   - She bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each.\n   - Total cost for coral = \\( 3 \\times 2.00 = 6.00 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Cost of fish:**\n   - She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each.\n   - Total cost for fish = \\( 20 \\times 0.50 = 10.00 \\) dollars.\n\n4. **Cost of fish food:**\n   - She bought 2 bags of fish food at $2.00 each.\n   - Total cost for fish food = \\( 2 \\times 2.00 = 4.00 \\) dollars.\n\nNow, we sum the costs of all the items:\n\\[\n5.00 \\text{ (rocks)} + 6.00 \\text{ (coral)} + 10.00 \\text{ (fish)} + 4.00 \\text{ (fish food)} = 25.00 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Scarlett spent is \\(\\boxed{25.00}\\).",
    "answer": "a bag of rocks cost $2.50 and she bought 2 bags so 2*2.50 = $<<2*2.5=5.00>>5.00\nShe bought 3 pieces of coral for $2.00 each so she spent 3*2 = $<<3*2=6.00>>6.00\nShe bought 20 fish that costs $0.50 each so 20*.50 = $<<20*.50=10.00>>10.00\nAll total she spent $10 on the aquarium, $5 on the rocks, $6 on coral, $10 on fish and $2 on food so 10+5+6+10+2 = $<<10+5+6+10+2=33.00>>33.00\n#### 33"
