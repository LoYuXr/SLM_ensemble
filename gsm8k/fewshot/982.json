    "question": "In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% of the class are football players.  Out of the remaining class, 25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band.  These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away game.  How many students are leaving early?",
    "completion": "To determine how many students are leaving early, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of football players in the class.\n2. Determine the number of students remaining after accounting for the football players.\n3. Calculate the number of students who are either cheerleaders or part of band.\n4. Subtract the number of students who are either cheerleaders or part of band from the remaining students to find out how many students are leaving early.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of football players in the class.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of football players} = 20\\% \\text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \\times 30 = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the number of students remaining after accounting for the football players.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students remaining} = 30 - 6 = 24\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the number of students who are either cheerleaders or part of band.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students who are cheerleaders or part of band} = 25\\% \\text{ of } 24 = 0.25 \\times 24 = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtract the number of students who are either cheerleaders or part of band from the remaining students to find out how many students are leaving early.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students leaving early} = 24 - 6 = 18\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students leaving early is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
    "answer": "20% of the 30 student class are football players so that's .20*30 = <<.20*30=6>>6 students\nThere are 30 students and 6 are football players so that leaves 30-6 = <<30-6=24>>24 students\n25% of the remaining 24 students are part of band or cheerleading so that's .25*24 = <<.25*24=6>>6 students\n6 students are football players and 6 are part of band/cheerleading so 6+6 = <<6+6=12>>12 students will be leaving early\n#### 12"
