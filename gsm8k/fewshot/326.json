    "question": "Some people got on a bus at the terminal. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \\( x \\).\n\nInitially, at the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people at the first bus stop is \\( x + 5 \\).\n\nAt the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in, so the number of people at the second bus stop is \\( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \\).\n\nWe are given that the total number of people at the third bus stop is 20. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ x + 6 = 20 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ x = 20 - 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 14 \\]\n\nSo, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
    "answer": "There were 20 - 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 people on the bus before 8 people got in at the second stop.\nThere were a total of 12 + 7 =<<12+7=19>>19 people at the second stop before 7 people went down.\nSo, 19 - 5 = <<19-5=14>>14 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n#### 14"
