    "question": "A pound of almonds costs $10 while a pound of walnuts costs $15. How much more does it cost for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The cost of almonds is $10 per pound, and the cost of walnuts is $15 per pound. The mixture consists of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.\n\nThe cost of the mixture of almonds is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of almonds} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ pound almonds}\\right) \\times 10 \\text{ dollars per pound} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThe cost of the mixture of walnuts is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of walnuts} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\text{ pound walnuts}\\right) \\times 15 \\text{ dollars per pound} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 15 = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSo, the cost of the mixture of almonds is $5 and the cost of the mixture of walnuts is $5. The difference in cost between the two mixtures is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ dollars} - 5 \\text{ dollars} = 0 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts is the same as a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, and the difference is \\boxed{0} dollars.",
    "answer": "One-half pound of almonds cost $10/2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.\nOne-fifth pound of almonds cost $10/5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.\nA one-third pound of walnuts costs $15/3 = $<<15/3=5>>5.\nSo, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $5 + $5 = $10.\nAnd 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $2 + $5 = $7.\nTherefore, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $10 - $7 = $3 more than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.\n#### 3"
