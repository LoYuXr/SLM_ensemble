    "question": "A singer has 50 microphones that he wants to arrange in pairs on a stage. While making the arrangement, he realizes that 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. How many pairs of microphones was he able to arrange on the stage?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange on the stage, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of microphones that will not fit in pairs.\n2. Subtract the number of microphones that will not fit from the total number of microphones to find out how many microphones can fit in pairs.\n3. Determine how many pairs can be formed from the microphones that can fit in pairs.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The singer has 50 microphones, and 20% of them will not fit in pairs. So, we calculate 20% of 50:\n\n\\[ 20\\% \\text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \\times 50 = 10 \\]\n\nThis means that 10 microphones will not fit in pairs. Therefore, the number of microphones that can fit in pairs is:\n\n\\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \\]\n\nSince each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\]\n\nThus, the singer was able to arrange \\(\\boxed{20}\\) pairs of microphones on the stage.",
    "answer": "The number of microphones that were not able to find space on the stage is 20/100*50 = <<20/100*50=10>>10\nThis means the singer could set 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 microphones into pairs on the stage.\nSince a pair has 2 microphones, the singer set up 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pairs of microphones on the stage.\n#### 20"
