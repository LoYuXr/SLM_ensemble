    "question": "Melissa is summoned to jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days listening to a court case. If Melissa is paid $15 per day but also has to pay $3 for parking each day, how much jury pay does she make per hour after expenses?",
    "completion": "To determine Melissa's pay per hour after expenses, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty.\n2. Calculate the total expenses for the day.\n3. Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find the net pay.\n4. Divide the net pay by the number of hours to find the pay per hour after expenses.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:**\n   Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total hours} = 6 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 18 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total expenses for the day:**\n   Melissa is paid $15 per day but has to pay $3 for parking each day.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total expenses} = 15 \\text{ dollars/day} + 3 \\text{ dollars/day} = 18 \\text{ dollars/day}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find the net pay:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net pay} = \\text{Total earnings} - \\text{Total expenses} = 18 \\text{ dollars/day} - 18 \\text{ dollars/day} = 0 \\text{ dollars/day}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Divide the net pay by the number of hours to find the pay per hour after expenses:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pay per hour after expenses} = \\frac{\\text{Net pay}}{\\text{Total hours}} = \\frac{0 \\text{ dollars/day}}{18 \\text{ hours/day}} = 0 \\text{ dollars/hour}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Melissa makes \\(\\boxed{0}\\) dollars per hour after expenses.",
    "answer": "First find Melissa's net daily pay by subtracting the parking expense from her $15 gross pay: $15/day - $3/day = $<<15-3=12>>12/day\nThen divide this number by the number of hours Melissa spends in court each day to find her hourly pay: $12/day / 6 hours/day = $<<12/6=2>>2/hour\n#### 2"
