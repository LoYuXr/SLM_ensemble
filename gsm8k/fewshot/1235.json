    "question": "Michael is traveling on the interstate at an average speed of 50km/hr (taking into account all the necessary stops for gas, relaxation, etc.). If he goes on like this for 3 days, and the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, what percentage of this distance has he covered?",
    "completion": "To determine the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total time Michael spends traveling:**\n   - Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr.\n   - He travels for 3 days.\n   - Therefore, the total time spent traveling is \\(3 \\text{ days} \\times 24 \\text{ hours/day} = 72 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the total distance covered:**\n   - The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km.\n   - Michael travels at a speed of 50 km/hr.\n   - Therefore, the total distance covered is \\(6000 \\text{ km} \\times 50 \\text{ km/hr} = 300000 \\text{ km}\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the percentage of the distance covered:**\n   - The percentage of the distance covered is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage covered} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Distance covered}}{\\text{Total distance}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the values we have:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage covered} = \\left( \\frac{300000 \\text{ km}}{6000 \\text{ km}} \\right) \\times 100 = 50 \\times 100 = 5000\\%\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the distance Michael has covered is \\(\\boxed{5000\\%}\\).",
    "answer": "There are 24 hours in each day, so he has been traveling for a total of 3*24 = <<24*3=72>>72 hours\nAt a rate of 50km/hr he has covered 50*72 = <<50*72=3600>>3600 km\n3600km as a percentage of 6000km is (3600/6000)*100% = 60%\n#### 60"
