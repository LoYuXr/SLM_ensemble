    "question": "Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together if Seattle has 20 sheep?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of sheep on Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of sheep in Seattle:**\n   - We know that Seattle has 20 sheep.\n\n2. **Determine the number of sheep in Charleston:**\n   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.\n   - Therefore, the number of sheep in Charleston is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 20 = 80\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse:**\n   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.\n   - Therefore, the number of sheep in Toulouse is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 80 = 160\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of sheep:**\n   - Add the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse:\n     \\[\n     20 + 80 + 160 = 260\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of sheep on Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is \\(\\boxed{260}\\).",
    "answer": "If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep\nToulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which is 2 * 80 sheep = <<2*80=160>>160 sheep\nTogether, the three has 20 sheep + 160 sheep + 80 sheep = <<20+160+80=260>>260 sheep\n#### 260"
