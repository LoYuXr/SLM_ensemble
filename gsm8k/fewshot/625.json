    "question": "Arianna plants a garden that has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. Currently, only 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed. How many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed?",
    "completion": "To determine how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.\n2. Determine how many of those flowers have bloomed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of flowers in the garden. The garden has 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row. Therefore, the total number of flowers is:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ rows} \\times 20 \\text{ flowers per row} = 200 \\text{ flowers}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. We know that only \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) of the planted flowers have bloomed. So, we calculate \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) of 200 flowers:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5} \\times 200 = \\frac{4 \\times 200}{5} = \\frac{800}{5} = 160\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{160}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Arianna planted 10 x 20 = <<10*20=200>>200 flowers in her garden.\nOut of the 200, 200 x 4/5 = <<200*4/5=160>>160 flowers that have currently bloomed.\n#### 160"
