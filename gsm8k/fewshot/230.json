    "question": "Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars for his company.  Each car sells for $20,000.  He pays 10% tax on the cars and then another $1000 for registration on each of them.  How much does he pay for everything?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount Mark pays for the cars, we need to consider both the tax on the cars and the registration fees. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars before tax:**\n   Each car sells for $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \\times 20,000 = 240,000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**\n   The tax rate is 10%. Therefore, the tax amount is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tax} = 240,000 \\times 0.10 = 24,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the cars after tax:**\n   The total cost of the cars after tax is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost after tax} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Add the registration fee:**\n   Mark pays an additional $1000 for registration on each car. Since he buys 12 cars, the total registration fee is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total registration fee} = 12 \\times 1000 = 12,000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total amount Mark pays:**\n   The total amount Mark pays is the sum of the total cost of the cars after tax and the total registration fee:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is \\(\\boxed{276000}\\).",
    "answer": "The cars cost 20000*12=$<<20000*12=240000>>240,000\nSo the tax came out to 240,000*.1=$<<240000*.1=24000>>24,000\nSo the cars cost 240,000+24,000=$<<240000+24000=264000>>264,000\nRegistration cost another 12*1000=<<12*1000=12000>>12,000\nSo his total cost is 264,000+12,000=$<<264000+12000=276000>>276,000\n#### 276,000"
