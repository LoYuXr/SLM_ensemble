    "question": "John brings his dog to the vet. His dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each, and a heartworm check. The heartworm check is 60% of his total bill. If he brought $125 with him, how much does he leave with?",
    "completion": "To determine how much John leaves with after his vet visit, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, and then subtract this total from the amount he brought.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines:\n- Each vaccine costs $20.\n- John needs 2 vaccines.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the vaccines is \\(20 \\times 2 = 40\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the heartworm check:\n- The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.\n- The total bill is $125.\n- Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is \\(0.60 \\times 125 = 75\\) dollars.\n\nNow, let's find the total cost of the vet visit:\n- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.\n- Therefore, the total cost is \\(40 + 75 = 115\\) dollars.\n\nFinally, let's determine how much John leaves with after his vet visit:\n- John brought $125.\n- After spending $115 on the vet visit, the amount left is \\(125 - 115 = 10\\) dollars.\n\nThus, the amount John leaves with is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
    "answer": "The vaccines cost 40 because 2 x 20 = <<2*20=40>>40\nThe vaccines are 40% of his total bill because 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40\nThe total bill is $100 because 40 / .4 = <<40/.4=100>>100\nHe leaves with $25 because 125 - 100 = <<125-100=25>>25\n#### 25"
