    "question": "John invited 20 people to a birthday party.  Each guest will eat 2 hot dogs.  He already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party.  If a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, how much does he need to spend on hot dogs?",
    "completion": "To determine how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party.\n2. Determine how many packs of hot dogs are required.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the hot dogs.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party.**\n\nJohn invited 20 people to the party, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ guests} \\times 2 \\text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \\text{ hot dogs} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many packs of hot dogs are required.**\n\nEach pack contains 6 hot dogs. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of hot dogs by the number of hot dogs per pack:\n\\[ \\frac{40 \\text{ hot dogs}}{6 \\text{ hot dogs/pack}} = \\frac{40}{6} \\approx 6.67 \\]\nSince John can't buy a fraction of a pack, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs 7 packs of hot dogs.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the hot dogs.**\n\nEach pack costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for 7 packs is:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ packs} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/pack} = 14 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is:\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]",
    "answer": "He needs 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 hot dogs\nSo he needs another 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 hot dogs\nSo he needs to buy 36/6=<<36/6=6>>6 packs of hotdogs\nThat means he needs to spend 6*2=$<<6*2=12>>12\n#### 12"
