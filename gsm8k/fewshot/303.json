    "question": "Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. Each book sells at 20$, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45. What's the total amount of money she earned in the second year?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of books sold in the first year.\n   - According to the problem, Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.\n   - Therefore, \\( x = 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\) books.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of books sold in the second year:**\n   - Elise sold 100 books in the first year.\n   - She sold twice as many books in the second year as she sold in the first year.\n   - Therefore, \\( 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\) books were sold in the second year.\n\n3. **Determine the total number of books sold in the two years:**\n   - Total books sold in the first year: 100 books.\n   - Total books sold in the second year: 200 books.\n   - Total books sold in the two years: \\( 100 + 200 = 300 \\) books.\n\n4. **Calculate the total earnings from the books sold:**\n   - Each book sells for $20.\n   - Total earnings from books sold: \\( 300 \\times 20 = 6000 \\) dollars.\n\n5. **Determine the number of books sold in the current year:**\n   - There are currently 50 unsold books.\n   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the current year is \\( 250 - 50 = 200 \\) books.\n\n6. **Calculate the total earnings from the books sold in the current year:**\n   - Total earnings from books sold in the current year: \\( 200 \\times 20 = 4000 \\) dollars.\n\n7. **Calculate the total earnings from the books sold in the second year:**\n   - Total earnings from books sold in the second year: \\( 200 \\times 20 = 4000 \\) dollars.\n\n8. **Calculate the total earnings from all sales:**\n   - Total earnings from all sales: \\( 6000 + 4000 = 10000 \\)",
    "answer": "If her sales in the current year are 45, she sold 45*2 = <<45*2=90>>90 books in the first year.\nThe total number of books sold in the first and current year is 90+45 = <<90+45=135>>135.\nThe total number of books sold in the second year is 250 of the original number of books - 135 sold books - 50 unsold books = <<250-135-50=65>>65 books.\nIf each book sells at 20$, then she earned 20*65 = $<<20*65=1300>>1300 in the second year\n#### 1300"
