    "question": "A classroom has a whiteboard which is shared between the 4 teachers who take turns using the classroom. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day and uses the whiteboard in each lesson. If the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, how many times is the whiteboard cleaned in a day?",
    "completion": "To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. Each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 times per lesson.\n2. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.\n3. The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per teacher per day:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ lessons per day} \\times 2 \\text{ times per lesson} = 4 \\text{ times per day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in total for all 4 teachers:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ times per day per teacher} \\times 4 \\text{ teachers} = 16 \\text{ times per day} \\]\n\nTherefore, the whiteboard is cleaned \\(\\boxed{16}\\) times in a day.",
    "answer": "In one day, there are a total of 4 teachers * 2 lessons each = <<4*2=8>>8 lessons.\nThe whiteboard is therefore cleaned 8 lessons * 3 cleans per lesson = <<8*3=24>>24 times.\n#### 24"
