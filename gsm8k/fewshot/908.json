    "question": "Dean has 30 marbles. He gives 1/5  of them to Jamie and gives 10 to Donald. How many marbles are left for Dean?",
    "completion": "To determine how many marbles are left for Dean after he gives some to Jamie and Donald, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of marbles Dean gives to Jamie.\n2. Calculate the number of marbles Dean gives to Donald.\n3. Subtract the total number of marbles given to Jamie and Donald from the original number of marbles Dean has.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Dean has 30 marbles. He gives 1/5 of them to Jamie.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Marbles given to Jamie} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 30 = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Marbles given to Donald} = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we add the marbles given to Jamie and Donald to find the total number of marbles given away.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total marbles given away} = 6 + 10 = 16\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtract the total number of marbles given away from the original number of marbles Dean has.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Marbles left for Dean} = 30 - 16 = 14\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles left for Dean is \\boxed{14}.",
    "answer": "Dean gives 30 x 1/5 = <<30*1/5=6>>6 marbles to Jamie.\nHe gives a total of 6 + 10 = <<6+10=16>>16 marbles in all.\nSo, Dean has 30 - 16 = <<30-16=14>>14 marbles left.\n#### 14"
