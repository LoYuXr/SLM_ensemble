    "question": "There are 700 bees in a hive. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and there are twice as many babies as queens.  How many worker bees are there?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of worker bees in the hive, we need to establish the relationships between the different types of bees based on the given information.\n\n1. Let's denote the number of queens as \\( Q \\).\n2. According to the problem, there are twice as many babies as queens. Therefore, the number of babies \\( B \\) is:\n   \\[\n   B = 2Q\n   \\]\n3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. Therefore, the number of worker bees \\( W \\) is:\n   \\[\n   W = 2B\n   \\]\n4. The total number of bees in the hive is 700. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   W + B + Q = 700\n   \\]\n5. Substitute the expressions for \\( B \\) and \\( W \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   2B + B + Q = 700\n   \\]\n6. Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   3B + Q = 700\n   \\]\n7. Substitute \\( B = 2Q \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   3(2Q) + Q = 700\n   \\]\n8. Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   6Q + Q = 700\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   7Q = 700\n   \\]\n9. Solve for \\( Q \\):\n   \\[\n   Q = \\frac{700}{7} = 100\n   \\]\n10. Now that we know the number of queens \\( Q \\), we can find the number of babies \\( B \\):\n    \\[\n    B = 2Q = 2 \\times 100 = 200\n    \\]\n11. Finally, we can find the number of worker bees \\( W \\):\n    \\[\n    W = 2B = 2 \\times 200 = 400\n    \\]\n\nThus, the number of worker bees is \\(\\boxed{400}\\).",
    "answer": "Let x represent the number of queens\nBabies:2x\nWorkers:2(2x)=4x\nTotal:x+2x+4x=700\n7x=700\nx=<<100=100>>100 queen bees\nWorkers:4(100)=400 worker bees\n#### 400"
