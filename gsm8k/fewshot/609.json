    "question": "Juan wants to add croissants to his bakery menu.  It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.  He wants to start with making 4 dozen a day for a week.  How many pounds of butter will he need to make these croissants?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need to make the croissants, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of croissants Juan wants to make in a day.\n2. Determine the amount of butter needed for one dozen croissants.\n3. Calculate the total amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants.\n4. Convert the total amount of butter needed from pounds to ounces (since butter is typically measured in ounces).\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 croissants, 4 dozen equals:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 12 = 48 \\text{ croissants}\n   \\]\n\n2. It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, for 48 croissants, the amount of butter needed is:\n   \\[\n   48 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 12 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. Juan wants to make these croissants for a week. A week has 7 days, so the total amount of butter needed for 48 croissants for 7 days is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 7 = 84 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n4. Since butter is typically measured in ounces, we need to convert 84 pounds to ounces. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so:\n   \\[\n   84 \\times 16 = 1344 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of butter Juan will need to make these croissants is \\boxed{1344} ounces.",
    "answer": "1/4 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he wants to make 4 dozen so that\u2019s 4*.25 = <<4*.25=1>>1 pound of butter\nHe wants to add 4 dozen croissants a day to the menu for a total of 7 days so he needs 1*7 = 7 pounds of butter\n#### 7"
