    "question": "Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. If his father also gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, and each marble weighs 2kgs, calculate the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store.",
    "completion": "To determine the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of marbles Solomon bought from his friend Johanna.\n2. Determine the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him.\n3. Add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna and the marbles his father gave him to find the total number of marbles.\n4. Calculate the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna.\n2. Solomon's father gave him \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. So, the number of marbles his father gave him is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{5} \\times 20 = 8\n   \\]\n3. The total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is the sum of the marbles he bought from Johanna and the marbles his father gave him:\n   \\[\n   20 + 8 = 28\n   \\]\n4. Each marble weighs 2 kilograms. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:\n   \\[\n   28 \\times 2 = 56\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is \\(\\boxed{56}\\) kilograms.",
    "answer": "After buying twenty marbles from his friend Johanna, Solomon had 20+50 = <<20+50=70>>70 marbles.\nSolomon's father gave him 2/5*20 = <<2/5*20=8>>8 more marbles.\nAdding Johanna's and Solomon's marbles, he has a total of 8+70 = <<8+70=78>>78 marbles.\nIf each marble weigh 2 kgs, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in store is 78 * 2 kgs = <<78*2=156>>156 kgs\n#### 156"
