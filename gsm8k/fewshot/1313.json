    "question": "A fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He sold all of them at a profit of 25%. How much was each watermelon sold?",
    "completion": "To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the watermelons:**\n   The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. Therefore, the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\$80\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the selling price per watermelon:**\n   The vendor sold all 50 watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price per watermelon, we first need to calculate the total selling price and then divide it by the number of watermelons sold.\n\n3. **Calculate the total selling price:**\n   The total selling price is the sum of the total cost and the profit. The profit is 25% of the total cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = 0.25 \\times \\$80 = \\$20\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total selling price is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total selling price} = \\$80 + \\$20 = \\$100\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon:**\n   The selling price per watermelon is the total selling price divided by the number of watermelons sold:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Selling price per watermelon} = \\frac{\\$100}{50} = \\$2\n   \\]\n\nThus, the selling price of each watermelon is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
    "answer": "The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.\nSo, he was able to sell them all for $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.\nThus, the vendor sold each watermelon for $100/$50 = $<<100/50=2>>2 each.\n#### 2"
