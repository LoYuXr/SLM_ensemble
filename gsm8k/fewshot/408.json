    "question": "Toby is reading a book that is 45 pages long. It averages 200 words a page. Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. He has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. How many minutes early will Toby be?",
    "completion": "To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the total time it will take him to finish the book and compare it to the time he has to get to the airport.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:\n\\[\n45 \\text{ pages} \\times 200 \\text{ words per page} = 9000 \\text{ words}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it will take Toby to read 9000 words at a rate of 300 words per minute:\n\\[\n\\frac{9000 \\text{ words}}{300 \\text{ words per minute}} = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nToby has to leave the airport in 60 minutes and plans to get to the airport in 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time he has to get to the airport is:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ minutes} + 10 \\text{ minutes} = 70 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nSince Toby has to leave the airport in 60 minutes and he has to get to the airport in 70 minutes, he will be 10 minutes early. Therefore, the number of minutes Toby will be early is:\n\\[\n70 \\text{ minutes} - 60 \\text{ minutes} = 10 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, Toby will be \\boxed{10} minutes early.",
    "answer": "He can read 1.5 pages in a minute because 300 / 200 = <<300/200=1.5>>1.5\nIt will take 30 minutes to read the book because 45 / 1.5 = <<45/1.5=30>>30\nHe will arrive at the airport 40 minutes from now because 30 + 10 = <<30+10=40>>40\nHe will be 20 minutes early because 60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20\n#### 20"
