    "question": "The bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. How many loaves of bread did they have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how many loaves of bread the bakers had left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of loaves baked on Monday.\n2. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning and the afternoon from the total baked.\n3. Subtract the number of loaves returned from the remaining loaves.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The total number of loaves baked on Monday is 200.\n\n2. The number of loaves sold in the morning is 93, and the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 39. So, the total number of loaves sold is:\n   \\[\n   93 + 39 = 132\n   \\]\n\n3. The number of loaves returned is 6. So, the number of loaves left after the sales is:\n   \\[\n   200 - 132 - 6 = 62\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of loaves of bread left is \\boxed{62}.",
    "answer": "The Bakery sold 93 + 39 = <<93+39=132>>132 loaves.\nThe Bakery made 200 loaves and sold 132, leaving 200 - 132 = <<200-132=68>>68 loaves remaining.\nThe grocery store returned 6 loaves, so there were 6 + 68 = <<6+68=74>>74 loaves left.\n#### 74"
