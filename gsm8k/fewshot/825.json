    "question": "Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards.  There is a total of 341 cards.  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.  How many cards does Becca have?",
    "completion": "To determine how many Magic Cards Becca has, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of Magic Cards Becca has.\n- Let \\( S \\) be the number of Magic Cards Smendrick has.\n- Let \\( P \\) be the number of Magic Cards PJ has.\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following information:\n1. The total number of Magic Cards is 341.\n2. Becca has 12 more Magic Cards than Smendrick.\n3. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of Magic Cards that PJ has.\n\nWe can translate this information into the following equations:\n1. \\( B + S + P = 341 \\)\n2. \\( B = S + 12 \\)\n3. \\( S = 3P \\)\n\nFirst, we substitute the expression for \\( S \\) from the third equation into the second equation:\n\\[ B = (3P) + 12 \\]\n\nNext, we substitute the expressions for \\( B \\) and \\( S \\) into the first equation:\n\\[ (3P) + (3P + 12) + P = 341 \\]\n\nSimplify and combine like terms:\n\\[ 3P + 3P + 12 + P = 341 \\]\n\\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \\]\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 7P = 329 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\n\\[ P = 47 \\]\n\nNow that we have \\( P \\), we can find \\( S \\) and \\( B \\):\n\\[ S = 3P = 3 \\times 47 = 141 \\]\n\\[ B = S + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \\]\n\nTherefore, Becca has \\(\\boxed{153}\\) Magic Cards.",
    "answer": "Let x represent the number of cards PJ has\nSmendrick:3x\nBecca:3x+12\nTotal:x+3x+3x+12=341\n7x+12=341\n7x=329\nx=<<47=47>>47 cards\nBecca:3(47)+12=153 cards\n#### 153"
