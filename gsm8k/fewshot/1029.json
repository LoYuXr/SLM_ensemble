    "question": "As Sally walked to school, she was holding the strings to 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. Suddenly, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst.  The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.  But as she neared the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree, and she added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, which she carried into the school.  What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?",
    "completion": "To determine the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Balloons:**\n   - Red balloons: 25\n   - Green balloons: 7\n   - Yellow balloons: 12\n\n2. **Red Balloons Burst:**\n   - 40% of the red balloons burst.\n   - Number of red balloons that burst: \\( 0.40 \\times 25 = 10 \\)\n   - Remaining red balloons: \\( 25 - 10 = 15 \\)\n\n3. **Yellow Balloons Released:**\n   - Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.\n   - Number of yellow balloons released: \\( \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\)\n   - Remaining yellow balloons: \\( 12 - 6 = 6 \\)\n\n4. **Blue Balloons Caught in a Tree:**\n   - 8 blue balloons caught in a tree.\n   - Sally adds 75% of these blue balloons to her remaining clutch.\n   - Number of blue balloons added: \\( 0.75 \\times 8 = 6 \\)\n   - Remaining blue balloons: \\( 8 - 6 = 2 \\)\n\n5. **Final Balloons:**\n   - Total remaining balloons: \\( 15 \\) (red) + \\( 6 \\) (yellow) + \\( 2 \\) (blue) = \\( 23 \\)\n\nThus, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is \\(\\boxed{23}\\).",
    "answer": "Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.\nBut 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.\nThe loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.\nShe added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.\nThus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons\n#### 34"
