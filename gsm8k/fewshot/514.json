    "question": "A house and a lot cost $120,000. If the house cost three times as much as the lot, how much did the house cost?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the cost of the lot as \\( L \\). According to the problem, the house and the lot together cost $120,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of the house} + \\text{Cost of the lot} = 120,000 \\]\n\nWe are also given that the house costs three times as much as the lot. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of the house} = 3L \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for the cost of the house into the total cost equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n\n\\[ 4L = 120,000 \\]\n\nTo find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[ L = \\frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \\]\n\nNow that we know the cost of the lot is $30,000, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying the cost of the lot by 3:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of the house} = 3 \\times 30,000 = 90,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the house is \\(\\boxed{90000}\\).",
    "answer": "Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.\nThe cost of the house is 3/4 of the total cost, which is $120,000. 3/4 * $120,000 = $<<3/4*120000=90000>>90,000.\n#### 90000"
