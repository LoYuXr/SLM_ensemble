    "question": "Madeline and her roommate, Keenan, share the cost of groceries. In total, they spend about $400 per month. In a four-week month, how many dollars does Keenan spend per week if Madeline pays 60% of the cost?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of groceries per month.\n2. Determine how much Madeline pays per month.\n3. Find out how much Keenan pays per month.\n4. Calculate how much Keenan spends per week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of groceries per month. The total monthly spending is $400, and Madeline pays 60% of this cost. So, we calculate Madeline's monthly spending as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Madeline's monthly spending} = 0.60 \\times 400 = 240 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we find out how much Keenan pays per month. Since the total monthly spending is $400, and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining amount:\n\n\\[ \\text{Keenan's monthly spending} = 400 - 240 = 160 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how much Keenan spends per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly spending by 4:\n\n\\[ \\text{Keenan's weekly spending} = \\frac{160}{4} = 40 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Keenan spends \\(\\boxed{40}\\) dollars per week.",
    "answer": "They spend $400/4=$<<400/4=100>>100 per week.\nKeenan pays for 100-60=<<100-60=40>>40% of the groceries.\nThus, she spends $100*(40/100)=$<<100*40/100=40>>40 per week.\n#### 40"
