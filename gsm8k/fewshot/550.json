    "question": "A shop sells school supplies. One notebook is sold at $1.50 each, a pen at $0.25 each, a calculator at $12 each, and a geometry set at $10. Daniel is an engineering student, and he wants to buy five notebooks, two pens, one calculator, and one geometry set. The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Daniel has to spend on all the items he wants to buy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of each item before the discount.\n2. Apply the 10% discount to each item.\n3. Sum the discounted prices to find the total cost.\n\nLet's start with the cost of each item before the discount:\n\n- Cost of one notebook: $1.50\n- Cost of one pen: $0.25\n- Cost of one calculator: $12\n- Cost of one geometry set: $10\n\nNow, let's apply the 10% discount to each item:\n\n- Discount on one notebook: \\(1.50 \\times 0.10 = 0.15\\)\n- Discount on one pen: \\(0.25 \\times 0.10 = 0.025\\)\n- Discount on one calculator: \\(12 \\times 0.10 = 1.20\\)\n- Discount on one geometry set: \\(10 \\times 0.10 = 1.00\\)\n\nNext, we calculate the discounted price for each item:\n\n- Discounted price of one notebook: \\(1.50 - 0.15 = 1.35\\)\n- Discounted price of one pen: \\(0.25 - 0.025 = 0.225\\)\n- Discounted price of one calculator: \\(12 - 1.20 = 10.80\\)\n- Discounted price of one geometry set: \\(10 - 1.00 = 9.00\\)\n\nNow, we sum the discounted prices to find the total cost:\n\n\\[\n1.35 + 0.225 + 10.80 + 9.00 = 22.375\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Daniel has to spend on all the items he wants to buy is \\(\\boxed{22.375}\\).",
    "answer": "Five notebooks cost $5 x 1.50 = $<<5*1.50=7.50>>7.50\nTwo pens cost 2 x $0.25 = $<<2*0.25=0.50>>0.50.\nThe total cost is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 =$<<7.5+0.5+12+10=30>>30.\nThus, total discount is 10/100 x $30 = $<<10/100*30=3>>3.\nTherefore, Daniel has to spend $30 - $3 = $<<30-3=27>>27 on all the items he wants to buy.\n#### 27"
