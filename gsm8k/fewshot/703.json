    "question": "Larry cooked dumplings for a group of friends.  There are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females among them. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. How many dumplings did Larry cook if each female ate 3 dumplings and there were no leftovers?",
    "completion": "To determine how many dumplings Larry cooked, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females:**\n   Each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total dumplings eaten by females} = 6 \\times 3 = 18\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of dumplings each male ate:**\n   Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Dumplings eaten by each male} = 3 + 1 = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males:**\n   There are 8 males, and each male ate 4 dumplings.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total dumplings eaten by males} = 8 \\times 4 = 32\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by all the friends:**\n   The total number of dumplings eaten by the males and females is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total dumplings eaten} = 32 + 18 = 50\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the number of dumplings Larry cooked:**\n   Since there are no leftovers, the total number of dumplings eaten must be equal to the number of dumplings Larry cooked. Therefore, Larry cooked:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Dumplings cooked by Larry} = 50\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of dumplings Larry cooked is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
    "answer": "So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.\nHence, the 8 males ate a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 dumplings.\nThe 6 females ate a total of 6 x 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 dumplings.\nSo, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is 18 + 32 = <<18+32=50>>50.\n#### 50"
