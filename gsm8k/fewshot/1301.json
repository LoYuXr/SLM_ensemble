    "question": "Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. How many cookies does he have now?",
    "completion": "To determine how many cookies Randy has now, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of each type of cookie step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of cookies:**\n   - Oatmeal cookies: 9\n   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4\n   - Sugar cookies: 5\n\n2. **Cookies eaten for snack:**\n   - Oatmeal cookies: 3\n   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3\n   - Sugar cookies: 3\n\n   Total cookies eaten for snack: \\(3 + 3 + 3 = 9\\)\n\n3. **Cookies eaten for lunch:**\n   - Oatmeal cookies: 1\n   - Chocolate chip cookies: 1\n   - Sugar cookies: 1\n\n   Total cookies eaten for lunch: \\(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\\)\n\n4. **Cookies given to friends:**\n   - Oatmeal cookies: 2\n   - Sugar cookies: 2\n\n   Total cookies given to friends: \\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\n\n5. **Cookies baked for dinner:**\n   - Oatmeal cookies: 4\n   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4\n   - Sugar cookies: 4\n\n   Total cookies baked for dinner: \\(4 + 4 + 4 = 12\\)\n\n6. **Total cookies after all events:**\n   - Oatmeal cookies: \\(9 - 3 = 6\\)\n   - Chocolate chip cookies: \\(4 - 3 = 1\\)\n   - Sugar cookies: \\(5 - 3 = 2\\)\n\n   Total cookies now: \\(6 + 1 + 2 = 9\\)\n\nTherefore, the total number of cookies Randy has now is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
    "answer": "Randy originally has 9+4+5 = <<9+4+5=18>>18 cookies in total.\nHe has 18-3 = <<18-3=15>>15 cookies left.\nHe has 15-2 = <<15-2=13>>13 cookies left.\nHe has 13-2 = <<13-2=11>>11 cookies left.\nRandy bakes 4*3 = <<4*3=12>>12 cookies.\nRandy has 11+12 = <<11+12=23>>23 cookies.\n#### 23"
