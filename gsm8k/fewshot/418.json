    "question": "Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. If Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, how big is Timothy's locker in cubic inches?",
    "completion": "To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the size of Peter's locker:**\n   Peter's locker is given as 5 cubic inches.\n\n2. **Determine the size of Zack's locker:**\n   Peter's locker is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, we can find Zack's locker size by dividing Peter's locker size by \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Size of Zack's locker} = \\frac{5}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\text{ cubic inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the size of Timothy's locker:**\n   Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can find Timothy's locker size by dividing Zack's locker size by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Size of Timothy's locker} = \\frac{20}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 20 \\times 2 = 40 \\text{ cubic inches}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the size of Timothy's locker is \\(\\boxed{40}\\) cubic inches.",
    "answer": "Zack's locker is 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 cubic inches.\nTimothy's locker is 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 cubic inches.\n#### 40"
