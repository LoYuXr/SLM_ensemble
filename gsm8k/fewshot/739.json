    "question": "Cecelia went to the milk store and found out that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. If a gallon jar costs $5, calculate the total amount of money she spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar:**\n   A gallon jar costs $5, and a half-gallon jar costs $2 more than a gallon jar.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 + 2 = 7 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of 10-gallon jars:**\n   Since each half-gallon jar costs $7, the cost for 10 half-gallon jars is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of 10 half-gallon jars} = 10 \\times 7 = 70 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of 16 half-gallon jars:**\n   The cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \\times 7 = 112 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   Add the cost of the 10-gallon jars and the cost of the 16 half-gallon jars:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 70 + 112 = 182 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is \\(\\boxed{182}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "If a full gallon costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, then the cost of a half-gallon jar is $5 - $2 = $3\nIf he bought 10 full gallon jars, she spent 10 jars * $5/jar = $<<10*5=50>>50\nFor the half-gallon jars, she spent $3/jar * 16 jars = $<<3*16=48>>48\nThe total amount she spent at the store is $48 + $50 = $<<48+50=98>>98\n#### 98"
