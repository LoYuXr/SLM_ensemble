    "question": "John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.  The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.  He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties?",
    "completion": "To determine how much John spent on ties, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of red ties John bought:**\n   John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Since he bought blue ties that cost $40 each, the number of blue ties he bought is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of blue ties} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of blue ties}}{\\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \\frac{40}{40} = 1\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \\times 1 = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the red ties:**\n   The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since the blue ties cost $40 each, the cost of the red ties is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of red ties} = \\text{Cost of blue ties} + 0.5 \\times \\text{Cost of blue ties} = 40 + 0.5 \\times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total cost of the red ties is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of red ties} = 2 \\times \\text{Cost of red ties} = 2 \\times 60 = 120\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount spent on ties:**\n   John spent a total of $200 on blue ties and red ties. Therefore, the total amount spent on ties is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount spent on ties} = \\text{Total cost of blue ties} + \\text{Total cost of red ties} = 40 + 120 = 160\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount John spent on ties is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",
    "answer": "He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties\nSo he bought 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties\nEach red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties\nSo they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60\nSo he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties\nSo he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties\n#### 800"
