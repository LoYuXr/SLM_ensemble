    "question": "Gretchen has some coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she had 70 gold coins, how many coins did Gretchen have in total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of silver coins Gretchen has.\n2. Calculate the number of gold coins Gretchen has.\n3. Add the number of gold and silver coins together to get the total number of coins.\n\nWe know from the problem statement that Gretchen has 70 gold coins. According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Therefore, we can calculate the number of silver coins as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of silver coins} = \\text{Number of gold coins} - 30 = 70 - 30 = 40 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total number of coins} = \\text{Number of gold coins} + \\text{Number of silver coins} = 70 + 40 = 110 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of coins Gretchen has is \\(\\boxed{110}\\).",
    "answer": "Gretchen has 70-30=<<70-30=40>>40 silver coins.\nShe has 70+40=<<70+40=110>>110 coins.\n#### 110"
