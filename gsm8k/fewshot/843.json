    "question": "Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills. He buys six squirt guns for $2 each.  He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each.  How much money does he have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Craig has left after his purchases, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spends and then subtract that from the amount of money he initially had.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the squirt guns:\n- Craig buys 6 squirt guns.\n- Each squirt gun costs $2.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the squirt guns is \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the water balloons:\n- Craig buys 3 packs of water balloons.\n- Each pack of water balloons costs $3.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the water balloons is \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) dollars.\n\nNow, let's find the total amount of money Craig spends:\n- The total cost for the squirt guns is $12.\n- The total cost for the water balloons is $9.\n- Therefore, the total amount spent is \\(12 + 9 = 21\\) dollars.\n\nFinally, let's determine how much money Craig has left:\n- Craig initially had $20.\n- He spent $21.\n- Therefore, the amount of money left is \\(20 - 21 = -1\\) dollars.\n\nSince the result is negative, it means Craig does not have enough money to cover his purchases. He is short by $1.\n\nThus, the amount of money Craig has left is \\(\\boxed{-1}\\).",
    "answer": "Craig starts off with 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.\nCraig spends 6 squirt guns * $2 = $<<6*2=12>>12 on squirt guns.\nCraig spends 3 packs of water balloons * $3 = $<<3*3=9>>9 on water balloons.\nTotal Craig has spent $12 + $9 = $<<12+9=21>>21.\nCraig has $40 - $21 = $<<40-21=19>>19 remaining.\n#### 19"
