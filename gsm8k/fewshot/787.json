    "question": "Samwell owns an appliances store. For this week, one-fourth of their sales are smart TVs, one-eighth are analog TVs, and the rest are OLED TVs. If they were able to sell a total of 40 TVs, how many OLED TVs were they able to sell?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of OLED TVs Samwell sold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of smart TVs sold:**\n   - One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.\n   - Total sales = 40 TVs.\n   - Number of smart TVs = \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10\\) TVs.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of analog TVs sold:**\n   - One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.\n   - Number of analog TVs = \\(\\frac{1}{8} \\times 40 = 5\\) TVs.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold:**\n   - The rest of the sales are OLED TVs.\n   - Number of OLED TVs = Total sales - (Number of smart TVs + Number of analog TVs).\n   - Number of OLED TVs = \\(40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25\\) TVs.\n\nThus, the number of OLED TVs sold is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
    "answer": "Samwell was able to sell 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 Smart TVs.\nHe was able to sell 1/8 x 40 = <<1/8*40=5>>5 analog TVs.\nSo, he was able to sell 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 Analog and Smart TVs.\nTherefore, the total number of OLED TVs that he was able to sell is 40 - 15 = <<40-15=25>>25.\n#### 25"
