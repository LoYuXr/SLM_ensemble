    "question": "Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are trying to catch them all, Pokemon that is.  Together they have caught 339 Pokemon.  Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. How many Pokemon has Stan caught?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \\( A \\). According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so we can express the number of Pokemon caught by Stan as \\( 4A - 13 \\). Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex is \\( 4A - 13 + 5 = 4A - 8 \\).\n\nThe total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\nA + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339\n\\]\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[\nA + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339\n\\]\n\\[\n9A - 21 = 339\n\\]\nAdding 21 to both sides of the equation, we get:\n\\[\n9A = 360\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 9, we find:\n\\[\nA = 40\n\\]\nSo, Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon. Now we can find the number of Pokemon caught by Stan:\n\\[\n4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \\(\\boxed{147}\\).",
    "answer": "Let x represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught\nStan: 4x-13\nAlex: 5+(4x-13)=4x-8\nTotal: x+4x-13+4x-8=339\n9x-21=339\n9x=360\nx=<<40=40>>40 Pokemon\nStan:4(40)-13=147 Pokemon\n#### 147"
