    "question": "Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives further away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school. If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?",
    "completion": "To determine who will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach the school and then find the difference in their travel times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes for Steve to reach the school:\n- Steve lives 3 miles away from the school.\n- Steve's biking speed is 440 feet per minute.\n- To convert miles to feet, we use the conversion factor \\(1 \\text{ mile} = 5280 \\text{ feet}\\).\n\nSo, the distance in feet is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ miles} \\times 5280 \\text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNow, we convert the distance from feet to minutes:\n\\[ \\frac{15840 \\text{ feet}}{440 \\text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, it takes Steve 36 minutes to reach the school.\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes for Tim to reach the school:\n- Tim lives 2 miles away from the school.\n- Tim's skateboard speed is 264 feet per minute.\n\nSo, the distance in feet is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ miles} \\times 5280 \\text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNow, we convert the distance from feet to minutes:\n\\[ \\frac{10560 \\text{ feet}}{264 \\text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, it takes Tim 40 minutes to reach the school.\n\nNow, we find the difference in their travel times:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ minutes} - 36 \\text{ minutes} = 4 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the winner will be waiting at their house for \\(\\boxed{4}\\) minutes before the loser finishes the race.",
    "answer": "Steve has to travel 3 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<3*5280=15840>>15840 feet to get home.\nIt will take Steve 15840 feet / (440 feet/minute) = <<15840/(440)=36>>36 minutes to get home.\nTim has to travel 2 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<2*5280=10560>>10560 feet to get home.\nIt will take Tim 10560 feet / (264 feet/minute) = <<10560/264=40>>40 minutes to get home.\nSteve will finish the race in 40 minutes - 36 minutes = <<40-36=4>>4 minutes less time than Tim.\n#### 4"
