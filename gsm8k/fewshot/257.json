    "question": "Each solid 10-foot section of a redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. Termites ate 30% of this redwood's wood. If the redwood is 200 feet tall, how much does it weigh?",
    "completion": "To determine the weight of the redwood tree, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree's wood.\n2. Determine the weight of the wood that was eaten by termites.\n3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by termites from the total weight of the tree to find the weight of the tree.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of the redwood tree's wood. Each 10-foot section of the tree weighs 400 pounds, and the tree is 200 feet tall. Therefore, the total weight of the tree's wood is:\n\\[\n200 \\text{ feet} \\times 400 \\text{ pounds/foot} = 80000 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the weight of the wood that was eaten by termites. Termites ate 30% of the tree's wood. So, we calculate 30% of 80000 pounds:\n\\[\n0.30 \\times 80000 = 24000 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by termites from the total weight of the tree to find the weight of the tree:\n\\[\n80000 \\text{ pounds} - 24000 \\text{ pounds} = 56000 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nThus, the weight of the redwood tree is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{56000}\n\\]",
    "answer": "First find how many 10-foot sections are in the redwood: 200 feet / 10 feet/section = <<200/10=20>>20 sections\nThen multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = <<20*400=8000>>8000 pounds\nThen find the amount of the wood the termites ate: 8000 pounds * 30% = <<8000*30*.01=2400>>2400 pounds\nThen subtract that amount from the total weight of the wood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = <<8000-2400=5600>>5600 pounds\n#### 5600"
