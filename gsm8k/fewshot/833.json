    "question": "Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami can.  But Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can.  And Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can.  If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, how high can Naruto lift a mountain, in feet?",
    "completion": "To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the relationships between the heights of the mountains and the heights of the people who can lift them.\n\n1. **Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.**\n2. **Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Saskay's height} = 12 \\times 1 \\text{ inch} = 12 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n3. **Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Kagiyami's height} = 4 \\times 12 \\text{ inches} = 48 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n4. **Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Naruto's height} = 10 \\times 48 \\text{ inches} = 480 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nSince there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Naruto's height from inches to feet:\n\\[\n\\text{Naruto's height in feet} = \\frac{480 \\text{ inches}}{12 \\text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nThus, Naruto can lift a mountain \\(\\boxed{40}\\) feet high.",
    "answer": "If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.\nSince Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4*1=<<4*1=4>>4 feet.\nAnd since Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami. then Naruto can lift a mountain 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 feet.\n#### 40"
