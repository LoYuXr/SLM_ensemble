    "question": "Charlie is a tennis pro.  He spends most of the day teaching others lessons on how to improve their game.  His standard fee is $80 per hour for lessons, but he reduces his rate by 25% when he is giving lessons to a veteran.   If today Charlie has 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate and 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, what is the total amount of money he will make for the day, in dollars?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from both the standard rate and the reduced rate for the veteran lessons.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the earnings from the standard rate lessons:\n- Charlie charges $80 per hour.\n- He has 4 1-hour lessons at this rate.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings from standard rate} = 4 \\text{ lessons} \\times \\$80/\\text{lesson} = 4 \\times 80 = \\$320\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the earnings from the veteran rate lessons:\n- The veteran rate is 25% less than the standard rate.\n- The standard rate is $80 per hour.\n- Therefore, the veteran rate is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Veteran rate} = \\$80 - (0.25 \\times \\$80) = \\$80 - \\$20 = \\$60 \\text{ per hour}\n\\]\n\n- He has 2 1-hour lessons at this rate.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings from veteran rate} = 2 \\text{ lessons} \\times \\$60/\\text{lesson} = 2 \\times 60 = \\$120\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings} = \\text{Earnings from standard rate} + \\text{Earnings from veteran rate} = \\$320 + \\$120 = \\$440\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{440}\n\\]",
    "answer": "4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate cost 4*$80=$<<4*80=320>>320.\nReducing the rate by 25% for veterans means he takes $80/4=$<<80/4=20>>20 off his standard fee.\nThus, for veterans, he charges the reduced rate of $80-$20=$<<80-20=60>>60 per hour,\nThus, 2 1-hour lessons with veterans cost 2*$60=$<<2*60=120>>120.\nAll together, Charlie will make $320+$120=$<<320+120=440>>440 for the day.\n#### 440"
