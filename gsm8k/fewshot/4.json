    "question": "Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?",
    "completion": "To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the morning.\n2. Calculate the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the afternoon.\n3. Add the amounts from the morning and afternoon to get the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the final meal.\n4. Determine how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal based on the number of chickens.\n\nLet's start with the morning feed:\n- Wendi gives each chicken 15 cups of feed in the morning.\n- There are 20 chickens in the flock.\n- Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning is:\n  \\[\n  15 \\text{ cups/chicken} \\times 20 \\text{ chickens} = 300 \\text{ cups}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the afternoon feed:\n- Wendi gives each chicken 25 cups of feed in the afternoon.\n- There are 20 chickens in the flock.\n- Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the afternoon is:\n  \\[\n  25 \\text{ cups/chicken} \\times 20 \\text{ chickens} = 500 \\text{ cups}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we add the amounts from the morning and afternoon to get the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the final meal:\n\\[\n300 \\text{ cups} + 500 \\text{ cups} = 800 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we need to determine how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal based on the number of chickens:\n- There are 20 chickens in the flock.\n- Therefore, the total amount of feed needed for the final meal is:\n  \\[\n  800 \\text{ cups} \\times 20 \\text{ chickens} = 16000 \\text{ cups}\n  \\]\n\nThus, Wendi needs \\boxed{16000} cups of feed in the final meal of the day.",
    "answer": "If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.\nIf she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.\n#### 20"
