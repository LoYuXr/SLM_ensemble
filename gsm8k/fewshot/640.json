    "question": "Bill is ordering a new truck. He has decided to purchase a two-ton truck with several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package.  The base price of the truck is $30,000, and the other features are at extra cost. The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Base Price of the Truck:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Base Price} = \\$30,000\n   \\]\n\n2. **King Cab Upgrade:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{King Cab Upgrade} = \\$7,500\n   \\]\n\n3. **Leather Seats:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Leather Seats} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{King Cab Upgrade} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\$7,500 = \\$2,500\n   \\]\n\n4. **Running Boards:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Running Boards} = \\text{Leather Seats} - \\$500 = \\$2,500 - \\$500 = \\$2,000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package} = \\$1,500\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum up all the costs:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Base Price} + \\text{King Cab Upgrade} + \\text{Leather Seats} + \\text{Running Boards} + \\text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = \\$30,000 + \\$7,500 + \\$2,500 + \\$2,000 + \\$1,500\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = \\$45,500\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost of Bill's new truck is **\\$45,500**.",
    "answer": "The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, at a cost of $7,500/3=$<<7500/3=2500>>2500.\nThe running boards are $500 less than the leather seats at a cost of $2500-$500=$2000\nThe total cost of the truck is $30,000+$7500+$2500+$2000+$1500=$<<30000+7500+2500+2000+1500=43500>>43,500\n#### 43,500"
