    "question": "The population of porcupines in a park is 50. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. If each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, how many porcupines will be in the park after a year?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.\n2. Determine the total number of porcupines after a year.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.**\n\nThe total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of the total population.\n\\[\n\\text{Number of female porcupines} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 50 = 30\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of porcupines after a year.**\n\nEach female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. There are 12 months in a year, so each female porcupine will give birth to \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) babies in a year.\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 30 \\times 48 = 1440\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of porcupines in the park after a year is \\(\\boxed{1440}\\).",
    "answer": "The number of female porcupines in the park is 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30.\nIn a month, the 30 female porcupines give birth to 30*4 = <<30*4=120>>120 new babies.\nAfter a year, with 12 months, the total number of new porcupines in the park is 120*12 = <<120*12=1440>>1440\nThe total population of porcupines in the park after a year is 50+1440 = <<50+1440=1490>>1490\n#### 1490"
