    "question": "Kalinda is working on a 360 piece puzzle with her mom. Kalinda can normally add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can typically place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.  How many hours will it take them to complete this puzzle?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of adding pieces per minute and then find out how long it will take to add 360 pieces at that rate.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can add per minute:\n- Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.\n- Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, so her mom can add \\( \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\) pieces per minute.\n\nNext, we calculate their combined rate of adding pieces per minute:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ pieces/minute} + 2 \\text{ pieces/minute} = 6 \\text{ pieces/minute} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how long it will take to add 360 pieces at this combined rate:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of pieces}}{\\text{Combined rate}} = \\frac{360 \\text{ pieces}}{6 \\text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{60}{60} \\text{ hours} = 1 \\text{ hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take them \\(\\boxed{1}\\) hour to complete the puzzle.",
    "answer": "Her mom places 2 pieces per minute because 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2\nOn average they get in 6 pieces per minute because 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6\nIt will take 60 minutes to complete the puzzle because 360 / 6 = <<360/6=60>>60\nIt will take one hour because 60 / 60 = <<60/60=1>>1\n#### 1"
