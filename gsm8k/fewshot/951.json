    "question": "The book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side. How many pages are in the book, if it is 1.5 inches thick?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the thickness of each page. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Determine the thickness of one page:**\n   - The book is 1.5 inches thick.\n   - Each page is printed on both sides, so each page has 2 pages.\n   - Therefore, the thickness of one page is \\( \\frac{1.5 \\text{ inches}}{2} = 0.75 \\text{ inches} \\).\n\n2. **Determine the number of pages in the book:**\n   - Each page is 0.75 inches thick.\n   - The book is 1.5 inches thick.\n   - To find the number of pages, we divide the total thickness of the book by the thickness of one page:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of pages} = \\frac{1.5 \\text{ inches}}{0.75 \\text{ inches per page}} = 2\n     \\]\n\nThus, the book has \\(\\boxed{2}\\) pages.",
    "answer": "There are 1.5*100=<<1.5*100=150>>150 pieces of paper.\nThen there are 150*2=<<150*2=300>>300 pages.\n#### 300"
