    "question": "On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, college student Kimo has three 1-hour  classes each day.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day.  In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school.  In one semester, how many hours does Kimo spend attending classes?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the hours for each type of class.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on each type of class:\n\n1. **Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:**\n   - Each day, Kimo has 3 classes.\n   - Each class is 1 hour long.\n   - Total hours per day = \\(3 \\text{ classes/day} \\times 1 \\text{ hour/class} = 3 \\text{ hours/day}\\).\n   - Total hours per week = \\(3 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 15 \\text{ hours/week}\\).\n   - Total hours per semester = \\(15 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 16 \\text{ weeks} = 240 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\n2. **Tuesday and Thursday:**\n   - Each day, Kimo has 2 classes.\n   - Each class is 2 hours long.\n   - Total hours per day = \\(2 \\text{ classes/day} \\times 2 \\text{ hours/class} = 4 \\text{ hours/day}\\).\n   - Total hours per week = \\(4 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 20 \\text{ hours/week}\\).\n   - Total hours per semester = \\(20 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 16 \\text{ weeks} = 320 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\nNow, we add the hours from both types of classes to get the total hours spent in one semester:\n\n\\[\n240 \\text{ hours} + 320 \\text{ hours} = 560 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \\(\\boxed{560}\\).",
    "answer": "Kimo spends 3 x 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours in class on any given Monday, Wednesday or Friday.\nEach week, he spends 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 hours in class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.\nIn one semester, he spends 9 x 16 = <<9*16=144>>144 hours in class for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.\nHe spends 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours in class on any given Tuesday or Thursday.\nEach week, he spends 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 hours in class on Tuesday and Thursday.\nIn one semester, he spends 8 x 16 = <<8*16=128>>128 hours in class on Tuesday and Thursday.\nIn total for one semester, Kimo spends 144 + 128 = <<144+128=272>>272 hours attending classes.\n#### 272"
