    "question": "Stetson made a bet with Alec that he would give up $10 for each orange he eats. While at the farm, Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked. If they picked 60 oranges, calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of oranges Stetson ate.\n2. Determine the amount of money Stetson gave up based on the number of oranges he ate.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of oranges Stetson ate. Stetson ate \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the 60 oranges they picked. So, we perform the following calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 60 = \\frac{2 \\times 60}{5} = \\frac{120}{5} = 24\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up. Since he gave up $10 for each orange he ate, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by $10:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount of money Stetson gave up} = 24 \\times 10 = 240\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",
    "answer": "If they picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them, he ate 2/5*60 = <<60*2/5=24>>24 oranges.\nIf he gave $10 for every orange he ate, then he gave up $10*24 = $<<10*24=240>>240\n#### 240"
