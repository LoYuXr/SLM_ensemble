    "question": "Tom decides to give his wife an anniversary getaway.  The plane tickets cost $5000 each.  The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal because it is a busy weekend.  The normal price is $1500 per day.  If they are there for 3 days how much did the trip cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, the hotel, and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. **Cost of plane tickets:**\n   - Each plane ticket costs $5000.\n   - There are two plane tickets.\n   - Total cost for plane tickets = \\( 5000 \\times 2 = 10000 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Cost of hotel:**\n   - The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal.\n   - The normal price per day is $1500.\n   - The increase is 20%, so the increase is \\( 1500 \\times 0.20 = 300 \\) dollars.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the hotel per day is \\( 1500 + 300 = 1800 \\) dollars.\n   - The hotel is used for 3 days, so the total cost for the hotel is \\( 1800 \\times 3 = 5400 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Total cost of the trip:**\n   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel.\n   - Total cost = \\( 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \\) dollars.\n\nThus, the total cost of the trip is \\(\\boxed{15400}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "The hotel room is 1500*.2=$<<1500*.2=300>>300 more expensive per night than normal\nSo they paid 1500+300=$<<1500+300=1800>>1800 per night\nThat means she paid 1800*3=$<<1800*3=5400>>5400\nThe plane tickets cost 5000*2=$<<5000*2=10000>>10,000\nSo the total cost is 10,000+5400=$<<10000+5400=15400>>15,400\n#### 15400"
