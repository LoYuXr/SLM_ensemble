    "question": "Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.  If he was stapling reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, how many reports did he staple altogether?",
    "completion": "To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling and then multiply that by the number of reports he can staple per 15 minutes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling:\n- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a span of 5 hours.\n- Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 5 hours is equal to:\n  \\[\n  5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 300 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 300 minutes:\n\\[\n\\frac{300 \\text{ minutes}}{15 \\text{ minutes/interval}} = 20 \\text{ intervals}\n\\]\n\nSince Vince staples 30 reports per 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ intervals} \\times 30 \\text{ reports/interval} = 600 \\text{ reports}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Vince stapled a total of \\boxed{600} reports.",
    "answer": "In one hour, there are 60 / 15 = <<60/15=4>>4 (15 minutes).\nFrom 8am - 11am, there are 11 - 8 = <<11-8=3>>3 hours.\nIn 3 hours, there are 3 x 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 (15 minutes).\nIn those 3 hours, Vince stapled 12 x 30 = <<12*30=360>>360 reports.\n#### 360"
