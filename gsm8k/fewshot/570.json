    "question": "Peter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. How many total action figures will he have by the end of the week?",
    "completion": "To determine how many total action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spends on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Peter spends on wooden action figures:\n- Peter has $70.\n- He spends $5 each on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday.\n- The number of days from Sunday to Wednesday is 3 days.\n\nThe total amount spent on wooden action figures is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of money Peter spends on plastic action figures:\n- Peter has $70.\n- He spends $2 each on plastic action figures from Thursday through Sunday.\n- The number of days from Thursday to Sunday is 3 days.\n\nThe total amount spent on plastic action figures is:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the amounts spent on both types of action figures to find the total amount of money Peter has by the end of the week:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ dollars} + 6 \\text{ dollars} = 21 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nPeter will have a total of 21 action figures by the end of the week.",
    "answer": "There are 7 days in a week so if he wishes to spend an equal amount of $70 each day that would be $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10\nFor four days (Sunday through Wednesday) he will spend 4*$10 = $<<4*10=40>>40\nHe will spend $40 on wooden action figures of $5 each which gives $40/$5 = <<40/5=8>>8 wooden action figures\nFor the remaining 3 days he will spend 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30\nHe will spend $30 on plastic action figures of $2 each which gives $30/$2 = <<30/2=15>>15 plastic action figures\nAltogether, he will have 8+15 = <<8+15=23>>23 action figures.\n#### 23"
