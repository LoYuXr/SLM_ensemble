    "question": "A council met to vote on a new regulation. The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. If there are 33 people on the council, what was the number of votes in favor of the new regulation?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.\n\nLet \\( F \\) represent the number of votes in favor of the new regulation. According to the problem, the number of votes against the regulation is \\( 33 - F \\).\n\nThe problem states that the number of votes in favor of the regulation is twice the number of votes against it. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\nF = 2(33 - F)\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve this equation step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the right-hand side of the equation:\n\\[\nF = 66 - 2F\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( F \\), add \\( 2F \\) to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nF + 2F = 66\n\\]\n\\[\n3F = 66\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \\( F \\):\n\\[\nF = \\frac{66}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nF = 22\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",
    "answer": "Let V be the number of votes against the new regulation.\nThere were twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation, so V + 2V = 3V = 33.\nThus, there were V = 33 / 3 = <<33/3=11>>11 votes against the new regulation.\nTherefore, there were 2V = 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.\n#### 22"
