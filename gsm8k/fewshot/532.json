    "question": "Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.  In 8 years his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age.  How many years separate the age of the two now?",
    "completion": "To determine how many years separate the ages of Jame and his cousin, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( J \\) as Jame's current age.\n- \\( C \\) as his cousin's current age.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.\n2. In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age.\n\nFirst, let's express Jame's age in 5 years:\n\\[ J + 5 = 27 \\]\nSolving for \\( J \\):\n\\[ J = 27 - 5 \\]\n\\[ J = 22 \\]\n\nSo, Jame is currently 22 years old.\n\nNext, let's express his cousin's age in 8 years:\n\\[ C + 8 = 2 \\times (J + 8) - 5 \\]\nSubstitute \\( J = 22 \\) into the equation:\n\\[ C + 8 = 2 \\times (22 + 8) - 5 \\]\n\\[ C + 8 = 2 \\times 30 - 5 \\]\n\\[ C + 8 = 60 - 5 \\]\n\\[ C + 8 = 55 \\]\nSolving for \\( C \\):\n\\[ C = 55 - 8 \\]\n\\[ C = 47 \\]\n\nSo, his cousin is currently 47 years old.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many years separate the ages of Jame and his cousin:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ years} - 8 \\text{ years} = -3 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nTherefore, the age difference between Jame and his cousin is \\(\\boxed{-3}\\) years.",
    "answer": "James is 27-5=<<27-5=22>>22 years old\nIn 8 years he will be 22+8=<<22+8=30>>30 years old\nSo in 8 years, his cousin will be 30*2-5=<<30*2-5=55>>55\nSo his cousin is 55-8=<<55-8=47>>47 years old now\nSo there is a 47-22=<<47-22=25>>25 year gap\n#### 25"
