    "question": "I am three years younger than my brother, and I am 2 years older than my sister. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. When you add all our ages, you get 87. How old am I?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the age of the brother as \\( B \\), the age of the sister as \\( S \\), and the age of the mom as \\( M \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following relationships:\n1. The brother is three years younger than the sister: \\( B = S - 3 \\).\n2. The brother is two years older than the sister: \\( B = S + 2 \\).\n3. The mom's age is one less than three times the brother's age: \\( M = 3B - 1 \\).\n4. The sum of their ages is 87: \\( B + S + M = 87 \\).\n\nFirst, we can use the second relationship to express \\( S \\) in terms of \\( B \\):\n\\[ S = B - 2. \\]\n\nNext, we substitute \\( S = B - 2 \\) into the first relationship:\n\\[ B = (B - 2) - 3 \\]\n\\[ B = B - 5. \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 0 = -5, \\]\nwhich is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem by using the third relationship:\n\\[ M = 3B - 1. \\]\n\nNow we substitute \\( B = S - 3 \\) and \\( S = B - 2 \\) into the fourth relationship:\n\\[ B + (B - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87. \\]\nSimplify the left side:\n\\[ B + B - 2 + 3B - 1 = 87 \\]\n\\[ 5B - 3 = 87. \\]\nAdd 3 to both sides:\n\\[ 5B = 90. \\]\nDivide by 5:\n\\[ B = 18. \\]\n\nNow we can find \\( S \\) and \\( M \\):\n\\[ S = B - 2 = 18 - 2 = 16. \\]\n\\[ M = 3B - 1 = 3(18) - 1 = 54 - 1 = 53. \\]\n\nFinally, we find the age of the brother:\n\\[ B = 18. \\]\n\nSo, the age of the brother is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
    "answer": "Let X be my age. My brother is X + 3 years old. My sister is X - 2 years old.\nMy mom is (X + 3) * 3 - 1 years old.\nThe sum of our ages is X + (X+3) + (X-2) + [(X+3)*3 - 1] = 87 years old.\nMultiplying through the parentheses and combining like terms, you get X*6 + 9 = 87 years old.\nSubtracting nine from both sides and dividing both sides by 6, you get X = 13 years old.\n#### 13"
