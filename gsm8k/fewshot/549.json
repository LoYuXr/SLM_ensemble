    "question": "Jonathan was sad to learn he needed 2 more toys than he already had to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set, which had 80 toys. How many toys does Jonathan currently have?",
    "completion": "To determine how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of toys in James's play set:**\n   James's play set has 80 toys.\n\n2. **Determine the number of toys needed to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set:**\n   Five times the number of toys in James's play set is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 80 = 400\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of toys needed to make a sorted play set:**\n   Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set 400 times larger than James's play set, we add 2 to the number of toys in James's play set:\n   \\[\n   80 + 2 = 82\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many toys Jonathan currently has:**\n   Jonathan currently has 82 toys.\n\nThus, the number of toys Jonathan currently has is \\(\\boxed{82}\\).",
    "answer": "Five times as large as James's set of play, which has 80 toys, is 5*80 = <<5*80=400>>400 toys.\nIf Jonathan was sad to learn he needed 2 more toys than he already had, then he had 400-2 = <<400-2=398>>398 toys\n#### 398"
