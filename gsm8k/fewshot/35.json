    "question": "Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes.  In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points.  In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points.  How many total points did he score?",
    "completion": "To determine the total points Mike scored, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate the points for each segment of his play.\n\n1. **First 20 minutes:**\n   - Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.\n\n2. **Second 20 minutes:**\n   - In the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.\n   - First, calculate 25% of 4 points:\n     \\[\n     25\\% \\text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \\times 4 = 1 \\text{ point}\n     \\]\n   - Add this to the 4 points he scored in the first 20 minutes:\n     \\[\n     4 + 1 = 5 \\text{ points}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total points:**\n   - Add the points from both segments of the play:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ points} + 5 \\text{ points} = 9 \\text{ points}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of points Mike scored is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
    "answer": "He scored 4*.25=<<4*.25=1>>1 point more in the second 20 minutes\nSo he scored 4+1=<<4+1=5>>5 points in the second 20 minutes\nSo in total, he scored 4+5=<<4+5=9>>9 points in the 40 minutes\n#### 9"
