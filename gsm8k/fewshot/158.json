    "question": "Raphael went to buy some school supplies. He bought 4 pens which cost $1.5 each, 2 notebooks which cost $4 each, and a rim of bond paper which cost $20. How much did Raphael spend on everything?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item he bought and then sum these costs.\n\n1. **Cost of Pens:**\n   Raphael bought 4 pens, and each pen costs $1.5.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of pens} = 4 \\times 1.5 = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cost of Notebooks:**\n   Raphael bought 2 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of notebooks} = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of Bond Paper:**\n   Raphael bought a rim of bond paper, and it costs $20.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of bond paper} = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Cost:**\n   Now, we sum the costs of all the items:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of pens} + \\text{Cost of notebooks} + \\text{Cost of bond paper}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 6 + 8 + 20 = 34 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Raphael spent a total of \\(\\boxed{34}\\) dollars on everything.",
    "answer": "Raphael spent 4 x $1.5 = $<<4*1.5=6>>6 for the pens.\nHe also spent 2 x $4 = $<<2*4=8>>8 for the notebooks.\nTherefore, Raphael spent a total of $6 + $8 + $20 = $<<6+8+20=34>>34 for the school supplies.\n#### 34"
