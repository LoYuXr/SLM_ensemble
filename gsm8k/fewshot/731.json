    "question": "Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores.  There are 3 sleeves in a box.  If 9 kids want 2 smores apiece and 6 adults will eat 1 smore apiece, how many boxes of graham crackers will they need?",
    "completion": "To determine how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we need to calculate the total number of smores required and then figure out how many boxes are needed based on the number of smores per box.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:\n- Each kid wants 2 smores, and there are 9 kids.\n  \\[\n  9 \\text{ kids} \\times 2 \\text{ smores/kid} = 18 \\text{ smores}\n  \\]\n- Each adult wants 1 smore, and there are 6 adults.\n  \\[\n  6 \\text{ adults} \\times 1 \\text{ smore/adult} = 6 \\text{ smores}\n  \\]\n- Adding the smores needed for kids and adults:\n  \\[\n  18 \\text{ smores} + 6 \\text{ smores} = 24 \\text{ smores}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many boxes of graham crackers are required to provide 24 smores. Each box contains 8 smores:\n- The number of boxes needed is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{24 \\text{ smores}}{8 \\text{ smores/box}} = 3 \\text{ boxes}\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, they will need \\boxed{3} boxes of graham crackers.",
    "answer": "Each sleeve makes 8 smores and there are 3 sleeves in a box so a box can make 8*3 = <<8*3=24>>24 smores\nThere are 9 kids who will eat 2 smores a piece so they will eat 9*2 = <<9*2=18>>18 smores\nThere are 6 adults who will eat 1 smore a piece so they will eat 6*1 = <<6*1=6>>6 smores\nTogether the kids will eat 18 and the adults will eat 6 so 18+6 = <<18+6=24>>24 smores\nEach box makes 24 smores and together the kids and adults will eat 24 s'mores so they will need 24/24 = <<24/24=1>>1 box of graham crackers\n#### 1"
