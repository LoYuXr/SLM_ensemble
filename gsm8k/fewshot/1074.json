    "question": "Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, and then started and finished another 500 piece puzzle within an hour.  How many puzzle pieces did Teddy place during that hour?",
    "completion": "To determine how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during the hour, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first puzzle and the second puzzle.\n\n1. **First Puzzle:**\n   - Teddy finished half of the 500-piece puzzle.\n   - Half of 500 is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{500}{2} = 250\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, Teddy placed 250 puzzle pieces in the first puzzle.\n\n2. **Second Puzzle:**\n   - Teddy started and finished the second puzzle within an hour.\n   - The second puzzle also has 500 pieces.\n   - Therefore, Teddy placed 500 puzzle pieces in the second puzzle.\n\n3. **Total Pieces Placed:**\n   - To find the total number of puzzle pieces placed, we add the pieces from both puzzles:\n     \\[\n     250 + 500 = 750\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is \\(\\boxed{750}\\).",
    "answer": "Teddy did 1/2 * 500 pieces = <<500/2=250>>250 pieces.\nTeddy completed 250 pieces + 500 pieces = <<250+500=750>>750 pieces.\n#### 750"
