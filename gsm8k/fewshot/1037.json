    "question": "The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound. Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.  Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan and 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.  Is she starts with $50 cash, how much money, in dollars, will she have left to buy meat?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Amor will have left after buying the cheese, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and then subtract that from her initial $50 cash.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:\n- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.\n- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.\n- Therefore, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$11/\\text{pound} = \\$22\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:\n- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.\n- Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.\n- Therefore, the cost of the mozzarella cheese is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$6/\\text{pound} = \\$18\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's find the total cost of the cheese:\n- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the Parmesan cheese and the mozzarella cheese:\n  \\[\n  \\$22 + \\$18 = \\$40\n  \\]\n\nFinally, let's determine how much money Amor will have left after buying the cheese:\n- Amor starts with $50.\n- The total cost of the cheese is $40.\n- Therefore, the amount of money left is:\n  \\[\n  \\$50 - \\$40 = \\$10\n  \\]\n\nThus, Amor will have \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars left to buy meat.",
    "answer": "The cost for buying 2 pounds of parmesan cheese is $11 x 2 = $<<11*2=22>>22.\nThe cost for buying 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is $6 x 3 = $<<6*3=18>>18.\nThe total amount spent for the 2 kinds of cheese is $22 + $18 = $<<22+18=40>>40.\nSo, Amor still has $50 - $40 = $<<50-40=10>>10 left to buy for meat.\n#### 10"
