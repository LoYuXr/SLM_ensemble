    "question": "Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. If they worked for 12 hours in a day, calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together.",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of chocolate pounds Ruiz and Marissa made together in a day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of chocolate Ruiz makes in one hour.\n2. Determine the amount of chocolate Marissa makes in one hour.\n3. Calculate the total amount of chocolate Ruiz makes in 12 hours.\n4. Calculate the total amount of chocolate Marissa makes in 12 hours.\n5. Add the amounts of chocolate made by Ruiz and Marissa to get the total.\n\nFirst, we know that Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Therefore, the amount of chocolate Ruiz makes in one hour is:\n\\[ \\frac{120 \\text{ pounds}}{2 \\text{ hours}} = 60 \\text{ pounds per hour} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of chocolate Marissa makes in one hour. Marissa makes \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) times as many pounds of chocolates as Ruiz makes in two hours. So, the amount of chocolate Marissa makes in one hour is:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} \\times 60 \\text{ pounds} = 45 \\text{ pounds per hour} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total amount of chocolate Ruiz makes in 12 hours:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ pounds per hour} \\times 12 \\text{ hours} = 720 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of chocolate Marissa makes in 12 hours:\n\\[ 45 \\text{ pounds per hour} \\times 12 \\text{ hours} = 540 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the amounts of chocolate made by Ruiz and Marissa to get the total:\n\\[ 720 \\text{ pounds} + 540 \\text{ pounds} = 1260 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together in a day is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1260} \\]",
    "answer": "Merissa makes 3/4 * 120 pounds = <<3/4*120=90>>90 pounds of chocolate in an hour.\nRuiz makes 120 pounds of chocolate in two hours; this means she makes 120 pounds / 2 hours = <<120/2=60>>60 pounds of chocolate in an hour.\nIf they worked for 12 hours, Ruiz made 12 hours * 60 pounds/hour = <<12*60=720>>720 pounds of chocolate while\nMarissa made 90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = <<90*12=1080>>1080 pounds of chocolate\nThe combined amount of pounds of chocolate they both ate is 1080 pounds + 720 pounds = <<1080+720=1800>>1800 pounds of chocolate\n#### 1800"
