    "question": "Tim makes a special honey and jam mix.  To make 1 jar of the mixture it takes 2 pounds of passion fruit and 1.5 pounds of jackfruit.  It also takes 2 pounds of special honey.  The passion fruit costs $6 per pound, the jackfruit is $8 per pound, and the honey is $10 per pound.  He sells each jar for $50.  How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?",
    "completion": "To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:**\n   - Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound\n   - Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound\n   - Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of passion fruit} = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of jackfruit} = 1.5 \\times 8 = 12 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of special honey} = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost per jar} = 12 + 12 + 20 = 44 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the revenue from selling 10 jars:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue per jar} = 50 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue for 10 jars} = 50 \\times 10 = 500 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the profit per jar:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit per jar} = \\text{Revenue per jar} - \\text{Total cost per jar}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit per jar} = 500 - 44 = 456 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total profit for 10 jars:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total profit} = \\text{Profit per jar} \\times 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total profit} = 456 \\times 10 = 4560 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix is \\(\\boxed{4560}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "The cost of the passion fruit is 2*6=$<<2*6=12>>12\nThe jackfruit cost 1.5*8=$<<1.5*8=12>>12\nThe honey is 2*10=$<<2*10=20>>20\nSo the total cost for a jar is 12+12+20=$<<12+12+20=44>>44\nSo the profit per jar is 50-44=$<<50-44=6>>6\nSo the total profit for 10 jars is 10*6=$<<10*6=60>>60\n#### 60"
