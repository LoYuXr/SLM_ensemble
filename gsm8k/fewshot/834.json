    "question": "Mason is on his bike journey at a rate of 8 miles per hour. He travels for 4 hours, takes some rest, and then goes on for another 6 hours. How many miles has he traveled in total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covers in each segment of his journey and then sum these distances.\n\n1. **First Segment:**\n   - Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour.\n   - He travels for 4 hours.\n   - Distance covered in the first segment = \\( 8 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 32 \\text{ miles} \\).\n\n2. **Second Segment:**\n   - Mason takes a rest.\n   - He does not travel during this segment.\n   - Distance covered in the second segment = \\( 0 \\text{ miles} \\).\n\n3. **Third Segment:**\n   - Mason travels for another 6 hours.\n   - Distance covered in the third segment = \\( 8 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 48 \\text{ miles} \\).\n\nNow, we sum the distances from all three segments to find the total distance traveled:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = \\text{Distance in the first segment} + \\text{Distance in the second segment} + \\text{Distance in the third segment}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = 32 \\text{ miles} + 0 \\text{ miles} + 48 \\text{ miles} = 80 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total distance Mason has traveled is \\(\\boxed{80}\\) miles.",
    "answer": "If Mason travels for 8 miles in one hour, in four hours, he traveled for 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 miles.\nAfter his rest, Mason traveled for another 6 hours, and since he was traveling at 8 miles per hour, he had traveled for 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 miles after the six hours.\nFor the whole journey, Mason traveled for 32+48 = <<32+48=80>>80 miles.\n#### 80"
