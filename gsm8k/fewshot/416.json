    "question": "A herd consists of camels and dromedaries. There are 180 heads and 304 bumps. How many dromedaries are there if camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each?",
    "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of camels.\n- Let \\( d \\) be the number of dromedaries.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1. The total number of heads is 180.\n2. The total number of bumps is 304.\n\nSince each camel has 1 head and each dromedary has 2 heads, we can write the first equation as:\n\\[ c + d = 180 \\]\n\nSince each dromedary has 1 bump and each camel has 1 bump, we can write the second equation as:\n\\[ c + 2d = 304 \\]\n\nNow we have a system of linear equations:\n1. \\( c + d = 180 \\)\n2. \\( c + 2d = 304 \\)\n\nTo solve this system, we can use the method of elimination. First, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \\( c \\):\n\\[ (c + 2d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \\]\n\\[ c + 2d - c - d = 124 \\]\n\\[ d = 124 \\]\n\nNow that we have \\( d = 124 \\), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \\( c \\):\n\\[ c + 124 = 180 \\]\n\\[ c = 180 - 124 \\]\n\\[ c = 56 \\]\n\nSo, the number of dromedaries is \\( \\boxed{56} \\).",
    "answer": "Let x be the number of camels.\nSince each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.\nEach camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 \u2013 x = 304 humps.\nx = 304 \u2013 180\nx = <<124=124>>124\nSo, there are 124 camels and 180 \u2013 124 = 56 dromedaries.\n#### 56"
