    "question": "Two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. How many cups of flour will Carla need to bake the cookies today and tomorrow?",
    "completion": "To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need to bake 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cookies needed:**\n   - Carla is making 36 cookies today.\n   - Carla is making 30 cookies tomorrow.\n   - Total cookies needed = 36 today + 30 tomorrow = 66 cookies.\n\n2. **Determine the number of cups of flour needed per dozen cookies:**\n   - Two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of dozens of cookies needed:**\n   - Total cookies needed = 66\n   - Cups of flour per dozen = 2\n   - Dozens of cookies needed = Total cookies needed / Cups of flour per dozen\n   - Dozens of cookies needed = 66 / 2 = 33 dozens\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of cups of flour needed:**\n   - Cups of flour per dozen = 2\n   - Dozens of cookies needed = 33\n   - Total cups of flour needed = Cups of flour per dozen * Dozens of cookies needed\n   - Total cups of flour needed = 2 * 33 = 66 cups\n\nTherefore, Carla will need \\boxed{66} cups of flour to bake 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow.",
    "answer": "Carla will bake a total of 36 + 30 = <<36+30=66>>66 cookies.\nSince 1 dozen is equal to 12, then 66 cookies are equal to 66/12 = <<66/12=5.5>>5.5 dozens.\nHence, Carla will need 5.5 x 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 cups of flour.\n#### 11"
