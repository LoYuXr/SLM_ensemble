    "question": "Jen is planning to sell her root crops. She has 6 yams which can be sold at $1.5 each, 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each, and 4 carrots which cost $1.25 each. If she sells everything, how much will she earn?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of crop and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. **Yams:**\n   - Number of yams: 6\n   - Price per yam: $1.5\n   - Total revenue from yams: \\( 6 \\times 1.5 = 9 \\) dollars\n\n2. **Sweet potatoes:**\n   - Number of sweet potatoes: 10\n   - Price per sweet potato: $2\n   - Total revenue from sweet potatoes: \\( 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\) dollars\n\n3. **Carrots:**\n   - Number of carrots: 4\n   - Price per carrot: $1.25\n   - Total revenue from carrots: \\( 4 \\times 1.25 = 5 \\) dollars\n\nNow, we sum the revenues from all the crops:\n\\[\n9 + 20 + 5 = 34\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jen will earn a total of **$34** from selling her root crops.",
    "answer": "Jen can earn $1.5 x 6 = $<<1.5*6=9>>9 for the yams.\nShe can earn $2 x 10 = $<<2*10=20>>20 for the sweet potatoes.\nAnd she can earn $1.25 x 4 = $<<1.25*4=5>>5 for the carrots.\nTherefore, she will earn $9 + $20 + $5 = $<<9+20+5=34>>34 if she sells everything.\n#### 34"
