    "question": "A charity group decides to do a yard sale.  10 people donate 5 boxes of stuff each.  They also have 10 boxes of stuff already.  They can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table.  If they already own 15 tables, how many new tables do they need?",
    "completion": "To determine how many new tables are needed, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of boxes of stuff donated.\n2. Determine the total number of boxes of stuff available.\n3. Calculate how many tables can be filled with the available boxes of stuff.\n4. Determine how many new tables are needed to accommodate the donated boxes of stuff.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of boxes of stuff donated:**\n   - 10 people donate 5 boxes each.\n   - Total boxes donated = \\( 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\) boxes.\n\n2. **Determine the total number of boxes of stuff available:**\n   - They already have 10 boxes of stuff.\n   - Total boxes available = \\( 10 + 50 = 60 \\) boxes.\n\n3. **Calculate how many tables can be filled with the available boxes of stuff:**\n   - Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff.\n   - Number of tables that can be filled = \\( \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\) tables.\n\n4. **Determine how many new tables are needed:**\n   - They already own 15 tables.\n   - Number of new tables needed = \\( 30 - 15 = 15 \\) tables.\n\nTherefore, the charity group needs \\(\\boxed{15}\\) new tables.",
    "answer": "There were 10*5=<<10*5=50>>50 donated boxes\nSo they have a total of 50+10=<<50+10=60>>60 boxes\nSo they need a total of 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 tables\nThat means they need 30-15=<<30-15=15>>15 tables\n#### 15"
