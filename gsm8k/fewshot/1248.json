    "question": "Jason works as a salesperson at a car dealership.  He needs to sell 15 cars this month to earn a big bonus.  He knows based on historical averages, that for every 25 telephone calls he makes to potential customers, he gets one person to come into the car dealership to look at new cars.  And for every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car.  Based on these average numbers, how many telephone calls would Jason need to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus?",
    "completion": "To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus, we need to consider both the number of cars he needs to sell and the number of customers he needs to reach to earn the bonus.\n\n1. **Number of Cars Needed to Earn Bonus:**\n   Jason needs to sell 15 cars to earn his bonus. This means he needs to sell 15 cars out of the 25 he makes.\n\n2. **Number of Customers Needed to Earn Bonus:**\n   For every 2 customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car. Therefore, to earn the bonus, Jason needs to sell enough customers to buy 15 cars. Since he needs to sell 15 cars, he needs to sell 15 customers.\n\n3. **Number of Telephone Calls Needed:**\n   For every 25 telephone calls, he gets one customer. Therefore, to sell 15 customers, he needs to make:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{15 \\text{ customers}}{25 \\text{ calls}} = 0.6 \\text{ calls}\n   \\]\n   Since he can't make a fraction of a call, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to make 1 call to sell 15 customers.\n\nSo, Jason needs to make 1 telephone call to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.",
    "answer": "If it takes 2 customers to make one sale, then to get his 15 sales Jason will need 2*15=<<2*15=30>>30 customers to come into the car dealership.\nSince Jason needs to make 25 telephone calls to get one person to come into the dealership, to get 30 customers, Jason must make 25*30=<<25*30=750>>750 telephone calls.\n#### 750"
