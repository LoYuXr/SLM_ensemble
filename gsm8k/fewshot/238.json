    "question": "Mary is two years younger than Joan, who is five years older than Jessa. If Jessa is 20 years old, what is the sum of the ages of the three girls?",
    "completion": "To determine the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Determine Jessa's age:**\n   Jessa is 20 years old.\n\n2. **Determine Joan's age:**\n   Joan is 5 years older than Jessa.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Joan's age} = \\text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine Mary's age:**\n   Mary is two years younger than Joan.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mary's age} = \\text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the sum of the ages of the three girls:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of ages} = \\text{Jessa's age} + \\text{Joan's age} + \\text{Mary's age} = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68\n   \\]\n\nThus, the sum of the ages of the three girls is \\(\\boxed{68}\\).",
    "answer": "Joan is 20 + 5 = <<20+5=25>>25 years old.\nMary is 25 \u2013 2 = <<25-2=23>>23 years old.\nTherefore, the sum of their ages is 20 + 25 + 23 = <<20+25+23=68>>68.\n#### 68"
