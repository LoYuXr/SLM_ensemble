    "question": "Skyler has 100 hats on his hand with the colors red, blue, and white. Half of the hats are red, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, and the rest are white. How many white hats does Skyler have?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of red hats:**\n   Skyler has 100 hats in total, and half of them are red.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of red hats} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of remaining hats after removing the red hats:**\n   Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of blue hats:**\n   Skyler has \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of the remaining hats that are blue.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of blue hats} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 50 = 30\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of white hats:**\n   Subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats to find the number of white hats.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of white hats} = 100 - 50 - 30 = 20\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of white hats Skyler has is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
    "answer": "If half of the hats are red, there are 1/2*100= <<1/2*100=50>>50 red hats.\nThe remaining number of hats which are not red is 100-50 = <<100-50=50>>50\n3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, a total of 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30 hats\nIf the rest of the remaining hats are white, then there are 50-30 = <<50-30=20>>20 white hats.\n#### 20"
