    "question": "Helena is a mad scientist testing her latest creation, the Lots-of-Limbs Serum. The serum will make the drinker grow an extra arm every three days and an extra leg every five days. After fifteen days, how many new limbs will Helena\u2019s serum cause a person to grow if they drink it?",
    "completion": "To determine how many new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of times the serum will cause an extra limb and then multiply that by the number of days it takes to cause one extra limb.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of times the serum causes an extra limb:**\n   - The serum causes an extra limb every three days.\n   - After fifteen days, the number of times the serum causes an extra limb is \\( \\frac{15}{3} = 5 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of new limbs caused by the serum:**\n   - Since the serum causes one extra limb every three days, after fifteen days, it will cause \\( 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\) extra limbs.\n\nTherefore, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow \\(\\boxed{15}\\) new limbs.",
    "answer": "At one new arm every 3 days, after 15 days, a person who drank Helena\u2019s serum would grow 15 / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 extra arms.\nAt one new leg every 5 days, after 15 days, the person would grow 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 extra legs.\nIn all, someone who drank Helena\u2019s serum would grow 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 new limbs after 15 days.\n#### 8"
