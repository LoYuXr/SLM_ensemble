    "question": "Brianne and Ashley make greek orange pie. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, while Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. If one greek orange pie needs three oranges, how many greek orange pies can they make?",
    "completion": "To determine how many greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought.\n2. Determine the number of oranges Brianne brought.\n3. Calculate the total number of oranges they brought together.\n4. Determine how many greek orange pies they can make with the total number of oranges.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ boxes} \\times 10 \\text{ oranges/box} = 50 \\text{ oranges} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ oranges} + 20 \\text{ oranges} = 70 \\text{ oranges} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of oranges they brought together:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ oranges} + 70 \\text{ oranges} = 120 \\text{ oranges} \\]\n\nSince each greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we divide the total number of oranges by 3 to find out how many pies they can make:\n\\[ \\frac{120 \\text{ oranges}}{3 \\text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \\text{ pies} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of greek orange pies they can make is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",
    "answer": "Ashley brought 5 x 10 = <<5*10=50>>50 oranges.\nBrianne brought 50 + 20 = <<50+20=70>>70 oranges.\nThus, they have 50 + 70 = <<50+70=120>>120 oranges altogether.\nTherefore, they can make 120 /3 = <<120/3=40>>40 greek orange pie.\n#### 40"
