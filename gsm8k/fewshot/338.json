    "question": "A class of 200 students is split into 3 groups such that 2 of them are equal in number and the last one (which is the smallest) is 10 less than each of the other groups. How many students are in this (smallest) group?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of students in the smallest group, let's denote the number of students in the three groups as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following conditions:\n\n1. The total number of students is 200.\n2. The number of students in the two equal groups is 2.\n3. The number of students in the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups.\n\nWe can express these conditions mathematically as:\n\\[a + b + c = 200\\]\n\\[a = 2\\]\n\\[c = a + 10 = 2 + 10 = 12\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\(a = 2\\) and \\(c = 12\\) into the first equation:\n\\[2 + b + 12 = 200\\]\n\\[b + 14 = 200\\]\n\\[b = 200 - 14\\]\n\\[b = 186\\]\n\nThus, the number of students in the smallest group is \\(\\boxed{186}\\).",
    "answer": "If 10 is added to the smallest group (hence to the total number of students), it would make all 3 groups equal to give (200+10)/3 = <<(200+10)/3=70>>70 in each group.\nNow taking the 10 away from one group gives the number of the smallest group as 70-10 = <<70-10=60>>60 students.\n#### 60"
