Determine the number of management employees who oversee the entire company.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of management employees.**\n\nThe company has 50 employees in total, and 20% of them are management. So, the number of management employees is:\n\\[ 50 \\times 0.20 = 10 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of management employees who oversee the entire company.**\n\nOut of the 20 management employees, only 30% oversee the entire company. So, the number of management employees who oversee the entire company is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 0.30 = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
    "answer": "20% of 50 employees are part of management so that's .20*50 = <<.20*50=10>>10 employees\nOut of these 10 employees, only 30% oversee the entire company so 10*.30 = <<10*.3=3>>3 people oversee the company\n#### 3"
