    "question": "Lindsay is doing the laundry, and thinks she has missed some socks. There are 50 socks that need washing. If she washes 10 pairs of socks and 15 loose socks, how many socks has Lindsay missed?",
    "completion": "To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pairs of socks washed.\n2. Determine the total number of socks washed.\n3. Subtract the number of socks washed from the total number of socks needed to find the number of socks missed.\n\nFirst, we know that Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of pairs of socks washed is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ pairs} \\times 2 \\text{ socks per pair} = 20 \\text{ socks} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Lindsay washes 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks washed is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ socks} + 15 \\text{ loose socks} = 35 \\text{ socks} \\]\n\nThe total number of socks needed is 50. So, the number of socks missed is:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ socks} - 35 \\text{ socks} = 15 \\text{ socks} \\]\n\nThus, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Splitting the pairs shows there were 10 pairs of socks * 2 socks/pair = <<10*2=20>>20 socks paired together.\nThis means she has washed a total of 20 paired socks + 15 loose socks = <<20+15=35>>35 socks.\nShe has therefore missed 50 socks \u2013 35 socks = <<50-35=15>>15 socks.\n#### 15"
