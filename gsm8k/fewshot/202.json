    "question": "Josie grows grapes on her 10-acre farm.  Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.  How many barrels of wine does her farm produce per year?",
    "completion": "To determine how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced per year.\n2. Convert the total number of tons of grapes into barrels of wine.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced per year. Josie's farm has 10 acres, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. Therefore, the total number of tons of grapes produced per year is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ acres} \\times 5 \\text{ tons/acre} = 50 \\text{ tons} \\]\n\nNext, we convert the total number of tons of grapes into barrels of wine. Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. Therefore, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year is:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ tons} \\times 2 \\text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \\text{ barrels} \\]\n\nSo, the farm produces \\(\\boxed{100}\\) barrels of wine per year.",
    "answer": "If each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, then her ten-acre farm produces 10*5=<<10*5=50>>50 tons of grapes per year.\nIf each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, then 50 tons makes 2*50=<<50*2=100>>100 barrels of wine per year.\n#### 100"
