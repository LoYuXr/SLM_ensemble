    "question": "Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.  They normally order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.  How much do they make a week if they are open 2 days a week?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the total revenue from both the reservations and the wine orders. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of reservations per day:**\n   Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of reservations per week:**\n   Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the number of reservations per week is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ reservations/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days/week} = 12 \\text{ reservations/week}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the revenue from reservations:**\n   Each reservation costs $5, so the revenue from reservations per week is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ reservations/week} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars/reservation} = 60 \\text{ dollars/week}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the revenue from wine orders:**\n   The restaurant normally orders 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. Therefore, the revenue from wine orders per week is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ meals} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars/meal} + 5 \\text{ dollars/bottle} = 10 \\text{ dollars} + 5 \\text{ dollars} = 15 \\text{ dollars/week}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total revenue per week:**\n   The total revenue per week is the sum of the revenue from reservations and the revenue from wine orders:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ dollars/week} + 15 \\text{ dollars/week} = 75 \\text{ dollars/week}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total revenue for Tom's restaurant in a week is \\(\\boxed{75}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "The meals cost 2*5=$<<2*5=10>>10 per table\nSo each table pays 10+5=$<<10+5=15>>15 a night\nSo they make 6*$15=$<<6*15=90>>90 a night\nThat means they make $90*2=$<<90*2=180>>180 a week\n#### 180"
