    "question": "A family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) are to divide a watermelon such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. What percentage of the watermelon does each adult get?",
    "completion": "To determine the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the sizes of the slices:**\n   Let the size of each kid's slice be \\( x \\). Then, the size of each adult's slice will be \\( 2x \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the total area of the watermelon:**\n   Let the total area of the watermelon be \\( A \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the area of each slice:**\n   The area of each slice is the product of the area of the watermelon and the fraction of the watermelon that the slice represents. Since each slice is \\( 2x \\) and the total area of the watermelon is \\( A \\), the area of each slice is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of each slice} = 2x \\times \\frac{A}{A} = 2x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the area of each adult's slice:**\n   Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, the area of each adult's slice is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of each adult's slice} = 2 \\times 2x = 4x\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets:**\n   The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is the ratio of the area of each adult's slice to the total area of the watermelon, multiplied by 100:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets} = \\left( \\frac{4x}{A} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\nSince the total area \\( A \\) is not provided, we can express the percentage in terms of \\( A \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets} = \\left( \\frac{4x}{A} \\right) \\times 100 = \\frac{400x}{A}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{400x}{A}}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.\nSince each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon\nSo the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage\nThe percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)\nx = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.\n#### 25"
