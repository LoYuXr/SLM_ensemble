    "question": "John hires a driving service to get him to work each day.  His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?",
    "completion": "To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to break down the costs into monthly and annual components and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the monthly cost of driving:\n- John drives 30 miles each day.\n- He drives to work 5 days a week.\n- He works 50 weeks a year.\n\nThe total distance driven each week is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 150 \\text{ miles/week} \\]\n\nThe total distance driven each year is:\n\\[ 150 \\text{ miles/week} \\times 50 \\text{ weeks/year} = 7500 \\text{ miles/year} \\]\n\nJohn gets charged $2 per mile driven. Therefore, the monthly cost of driving is:\n\\[ 7500 \\text{ miles/year} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/mile} = 15000 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the annual cost of driving:\n- John gets a $150 bonus per month.\n- Therefore, the annual bonus is:\n\\[ 150 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 1800 \\text{ dollars/year} \\]\n\nNow, we sum up the monthly and annual costs:\n\\[ 15000 \\text{ dollars/month} + 1800 \\text{ dollars/year} = 16800 \\text{ dollars/year} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount John pays a year for driving is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{16800}\n\\]",
    "answer": "He has to travel 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 miles per day\nThat means he travels 60*5=<<60*5=300>>300 miles per week\nSo he pays 300*2=$<<300*2=600>>600 per week\nThat means he pays $600*50=$<<600*50=30000>>30000 a year for miles driven\nHe also gives $150*12=$<<150*12=1800>>1800 a year as a bonus to his driver\nSo he pays $30000+$1800=$<<30000+1800=31800>>31,800 a year\n#### 31800"
