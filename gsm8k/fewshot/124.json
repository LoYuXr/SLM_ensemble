    "question": "Jennie is helping at her mom's office. She has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps, and a pile of letters already stamped. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. If there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, how many were in that pile when Jennie began?",
    "completion": "To determine how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of letters needing stamps:**\n   Jennie has a total of 60 letters needing stamps.\n\n2. **Determine how many letters are already stamped:**\n   Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. Therefore, the number of letters already stamped is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of letters still needing stamps:**\n   Subtract the number of already stamped letters from the total number of letters needing stamps:\n   \\[\n   60 - 20 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Identify the number of letters already stamped:**\n   We are given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of letters that were already stamped before Jennie began:**\n   Subtract the number of letters still needing stamps from the number of letters already stamped:\n   \\[\n   20 - 30 = -10\n   \\]\n\nSince the number of letters already stamped cannot be negative, it indicates that Jennie must have started with fewer than 20 letters already stamped. However, the problem states that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, which implies that Jennie must have started with more than 20 letters already stamped.\n\nGiven the problem constraints and the logical steps, the number of letters already stamped before Jennie began is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",
    "answer": "She stamped 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 letters.\nThen there were 30-20=<<30-20=10>>10 in the already-stamped pile to begin with.\n#### 10"
