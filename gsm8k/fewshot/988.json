    "question": "Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month.  She sets 25% of her paycheck aside to put towards fancy shoes.  Each pair of shoes she buys costs $1,000.00.  How many shoes can she buy in a year?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Jessica's monthly salary.\n2. Determine how much she sets aside for shoes each month.\n3. Calculate her annual salary.\n4. Determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her annual salary.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Jessica's monthly salary.**\n\nJessica makes $2,000.00 a month.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much she sets aside for shoes each month.**\n\nShe sets aside 25% of her monthly salary to put towards shoes.\n\n\\[ \\text{Amount set aside per month} = 25\\% \\times \\$2,000.00 = 0.25 \\times 2,000.00 = \\$500.00 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate her annual salary.**\n\nThere are 12 months in a year.\n\n\\[ \\text{Annual salary} = 12 \\times \\$2,000.00 = \\$24,000.00 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her annual salary.**\n\nEach pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of pairs of shoes she can buy} = \\frac{\\text{Annual salary}}{\\text{Cost per pair of shoes}} = \\frac{\\$24,000.00}{\\$1,000.00} = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jessica can buy \\(\\boxed{24}\\) pairs of shoes in a year.",
    "answer": "She is paid $2,000.00 a month and she saves 25% for shoes so she saves 2000*.25 = $<<2000*.25=500.00>>500.00\nShe saves $500.00 a month for 12 months so she saves 500*12 = $<<500*12=6000.00>>6,000.00\nEach pair of shoes costs $1,000.00 and she has saved $6,000.00 so she can buy 6000/1000 = 6 pair of shoes per year\n#### 6"
