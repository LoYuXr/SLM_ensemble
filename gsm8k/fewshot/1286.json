    "question": "James likes to check the coin return of the vending machine for change. One day he finds a quarter, two nickels, and 7 dimes. How much money in cents does James have?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Value of the quarter:**\n   - A quarter is worth 25 cents.\n\n2. **Value of the nickels:**\n   - Each nickel is worth 5 cents.\n   - James has 2 nickels.\n   - The total value of the nickels is \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) cents.\n\n3. **Value of the dimes:**\n   - Each dime is worth 10 cents.\n   - James has 7 dimes.\n   - The total value of the dimes is \\( 7 \\times 10 = 70 \\) cents.\n\nNow, we sum up the values of all the coins:\n\\[\n25 \\text{ cents} + 10 \\text{ cents} + 70 \\text{ cents} = 105 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money James has is \\(\\boxed{105}\\) cents.",
    "answer": "First figure out how much the nickels are worth: 2 * 5 cents = <<2*5=10>>10 cents\nThen figure out how much the dimes are worth: 7 * 10 cents = <<7*10=70>>70 cents\nFinally, add the value of the nickels, dimes and quarter: 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = <<25+10+70=105>>105 cents\n#### 105"
