    "question": "Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. After that, she runs 5 miles per hour. How many miles can she run in 7 hours?",
    "completion": "To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running time into two segments and calculate the distance for each segment separately.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance at 10 mph} = 10 \\text{ mph} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours (since she stops after 3 hours):\n\\[\n\\text{Distance at 5 mph} = 5 \\text{ mph} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 20 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the distances from both segments to find the total distance Rosie runs in 7 hours:\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = 30 \\text{ miles} + 20 \\text{ miles} = 50 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is \\boxed{50} miles.",
    "answer": "For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs 10 miles per hour, so she runs 10*3=<<10*3=30>>30 miles.\nHowever, she still has 7-3=<<7-3=4>>4 hours left to room.\nFor the next 4 hours, she runs 5 miles per hour, so she runs 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 miles.\nIn total she runs 30+20=<<30+20=50>>50 miles.\n#### 50"
