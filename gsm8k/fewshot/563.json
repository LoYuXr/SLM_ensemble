    "question": "James decides to buy birthday candles for his 2 sons.  One of them is 12 and the other is 4 years younger.  A pack of 5 candles costs $3.  How much does James spend on candles?",
    "completion": "To determine how much James spends on candles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the age of the first son:**\n   The first son is 12 years old.\n\n2. **Determine the age of the second son:**\n   The second son is 4 years younger than the first son. Therefore, the second son is:\n   \\[\n   12 - 4 = 8 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of packs needed:**\n   Each pack contains 5 candles. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12 + 8}{5} = \\frac{20}{5} = 4 \\text{ packs}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   Since each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 3 = 12 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, James spends \\(\\boxed{12}\\) dollars on candles.",
    "answer": "His younger son is 12-4=<<12-4=8>>8 years old\nSo he needs 12+8=<<12+8=20>>20 candles\nThat means he needs 20/5=<<20/5=4>>4 packs of candles\nThe total cost of those is 4*3=$<<4*3=12>>12\n#### 12"
