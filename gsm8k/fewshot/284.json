    "question": "Alani's family decided that the children should write stories of any kind. They were then required to read all of the stories they'd written to the family at the end of the weekend. Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, her brother Braylen wrote 40 stories, and her sister Margot wrote 60 stories. If they each doubled the number of stories they'd written in the first week in the second week, calculate the total number of stories they wrote altogether.",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of stories written by each family member in the second week.\n2. Sum the number of stories written by all three family members in the second week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of stories written by each family member in the second week:\n- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. Since she doubled the number of stories she wrote in the second week, she wrote \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) stories in the second week.\n- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week. Since she doubled the number of stories she wrote in the second week, she wrote \\(2 \\times 40 = 80\\) stories in the second week.\n- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week. Since she doubled the number of stories she wrote in the second week, she wrote \\(2 \\times 60 = 120\\) stories in the second week.\n\nNext, we sum the number of stories written by all three family members in the second week:\n\\[40 + 80 + 120 = 240\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",
    "answer": "In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, and if she doubled the number in the second week, the total number of stories in the second week is 20*2 = <<20*2=40>>40.\nIn total, Alani had written 40+20 = <<40+20=60>>60 stories in the two weeks.\nBraylen also wrote 40 stories in the first week, and on doubling that number in the second week the number became 2*40 =<<40*2=80>>80\nHis total number of stories in the two weeks is 80+40 = <<80+40=120>>120\nTogether, Alani and her brother Braylen had written 120+60 = <<120+60=180>>180 stories.\nWhen Margot doubled the number of stories she wrote in the first week in the second week, she wrote 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 stories in the second week.\nIn total, she wrote 60+120= <<60+120=180>>180 stories.\nAltogether, the three siblings wrote 180+180 = <<180+180=360>>360 stories in the two weeks.\n#### 360"
