    "question": "John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 lego sets and he sells them for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left. How many lego sets does he still have?",
    "completion": "To determine how many lego sets John still has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money John spent on the video games.\n2. Determine how much money John had initially.\n3. Calculate how much money John has left after buying the video games.\n4. Find out how much money John spent on the lego sets.\n5. Determine how many lego sets John still has.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money John spent on the video games.\n   John bought 8 video games for $20 each.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total spent on video games} = 8 \\times 20 = 160 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine how much money John had initially.\n   John started with $5 after buying the video games.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial amount} = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate how much money John has left after buying the video games.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money left} = 5 - 160 = -155 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Since the money left is negative, it means John did not have enough money to buy the video games. This indicates that John did not have enough money to buy the video games, and he still owes $155.\n\n4. Find out how much money John spent on the lego sets.\n   John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money spent on lego sets} = 13 \\times 15 = 195 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. Determine how many lego sets John still has.\n   Since John started with $5 and he spent $195 on the lego sets, he has:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money left} = 5 - 195 = -190 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Again, this indicates that John did not have enough money to buy the lego sets, and he still owes $190.\n\nHowever, since the problem states that John has $5 left after buying the video games, and he still owes $190, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem setup. Given the constraints, the correct interpretation is that John does not have enough money to buy the video games, and he",
    "answer": "He spent $160 on video games because 8 x 20 = <<8*20=160>>160\nHe earned $165 from his sale because 160 + 5 = <<160+5=165>>165\nHe sold 11 lego sets because 11 x 15 = <<11*15=165>>165\nHe has 2 sets left because 13 - 11 = <<13-11=2>>2\n#### 2"
