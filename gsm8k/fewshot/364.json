    "question": "There are 96 fourth-graders at Small Tree  School. 43 of them are girls. On Friday, 5 fourth-grade girls and 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. How many fourth grade boys were at Small Tree  School on Friday?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school:**\n   - We know that 43 fourth-grade girls are present.\n   - We also know that 5 fourth-grade girls are absent.\n   - Therefore, the number of fourth-grade girls present is:\n     \\[\n     43 - 5 = 38\n     \\]\n   - Since the total number of fourth-grade students at the school is 96, the number of fourth-grade boys present is:\n     \\[\n     96 - 38 = 58\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of fourth-grade boys absent:**\n   - We know that 4 fourth-grade boys are absent.\n   - Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys present is:\n     \\[\n     58 - 4 = 54\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
    "answer": "Of the 96 fourth graders, 43 are girls, so 96 students - 43 girls = <<96-43=53>>53 boys.\nOn Friday there were 53 boys - 4 absent = <<53-4=49>>49 boys.\n#### 49"
