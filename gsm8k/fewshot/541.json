    "question": "Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125. In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half in order to hit his target. How much does he have to save for each day in the second half of the month?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of days in April:**\n   April has 30 days.\n\n2. **Determine the number of days in the first half of April:**\n   Since the first half of April is from January 1 to March 31, there are \\(30 - 21 = 9\\) days in the first half of April.\n\n3. **Determine the number of days in the second half of April:**\n   The second half of April is from April 1 to April 30, which is \\(30 - 29 = 1\\) day in the second half of April.\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount Elvis needs to save in the second half of April:**\n   Since he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half, we multiply the number of days in the second half by 2:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ day} \\times 2 = 2 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the daily savings in the second half of April:**\n   Since Elvis saves $1125 in total and he saves $2 in the second half, the daily savings in the second half is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1125}{2} = 562.5 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Elvis needs to save \\(\\boxed{562.5}\\) dollars each day in the second half of the month.",
    "answer": "Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y\nSince y is twice as much what he saved in each day of the first half, he saved y/2 in each day of the first half\nApril has 30 days, 15 days in each half, so he is saving (15*(y/2)) in the 1st half, (15*y) in the 2nd half to give (15*(y/2))+(15*y)=$1125\nSolving the equation gives 15(3y/2) = $1125\n45y/2 = $1125\ny = $1125*(2/45)\ny = $<<50=50>>50\n#### 50"
