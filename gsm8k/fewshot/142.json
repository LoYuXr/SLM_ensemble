    "question": "Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. He also has a part-time job where he earns $10 an hour. How much money would Jordan earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week.\n2. Calculate the total amount of money Jordan earns from his part-time job in one week.\n3. Subtract the amount of money Jordan earns from his part-time job from the total amount of money he earns from playing video games.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week. Since he plays video games for 2 hours every day and there are 7 days in a week, we have:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 14 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of money Jordan earns from his part-time job in one week. Since he earns $10 per hour, we have:\n\\[ 14 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \\text{ dollars/week} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the amount of money Jordan earns from his part-time job from the total amount of money he earns from playing video games:\n\\[ 140 \\text{ dollars/week} - 140 \\text{ dollars/week} = 0 \\text{ dollars/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \\(\\boxed{0}\\) dollars in one week.",
    "answer": "Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day x 7 days in a week = <<2*7=14>>14 hours a week.\nIf Jordan spent his 14 hours working instead, he would make 14 hours x $10 = $<<14*10=140>>140.\n#### 140"
