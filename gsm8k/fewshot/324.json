    "question": "Ralph has a record store where people can trade their own records for new ones. People can trade 2 old records for 1 new one. 5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records between them. How many old records did the 5 people bring in?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of old records brought in by the 5 people, we need to analyze the trade process and the total number of new records produced.\n\n1. **Understanding the Trade Process:**\n   - Each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record.\n   - This means that for every 3 records (2 old + 1 new), 1 record is traded.\n\n2. **Total Number of Records Traded:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of people who brought in old records.\n   - Each person trades 2 old records, so the total number of old records traded is \\( 2x \\).\n   - The total number of new records produced is the total number of old records traded, which is \\( 2x \\).\n\n3. **Total Number of New Records:**\n   - According to the problem, 5 people leave with 7 new records.\n   - Therefore, the total number of new records produced is 5.\n\n4. **Setting Up the Equation:**\n   - The total number of new records produced is equal to the total number of old records traded.\n   - So, we have:\n     \\[\n     2x = 5\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solving for \\( x \\):**\n   - To find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of people who brought in old records is 2.5.\n   - Since the number of people must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem constraints or consider if there might be a misinterpretation. However, based on the given information and the logical steps, the number of old records brought in is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2.5}\n\\]",
    "answer": "People can bring in 2 old records = get 1 new record.\n5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records, 7 new records x 2 old records traded for each = <<7*2=14>>14 old records that the 5 people brought in.\n#### 14"
