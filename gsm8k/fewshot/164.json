    "question": "Jackie is trying to decide whether to do her taxes herself or hire an accountant. If she does the taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, losing $35/hour in missed income. The accountant charges $90. How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference in her income from doing the taxes herself versus hiring an accountant.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the income Jackie will lose if she does the taxes herself:\n- Jackie will be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work.\n- She loses $35/hour in missed income.\n\nSo, the total income lost is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$35/\\text{hour} = \\$105 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the income she will earn if she hires the accountant:\n- The accountant charges $90 per hour.\n- She will be able to work 4 hours per week (since she will be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work).\n\nSo, the total income from hiring the accountant is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$90/\\text{hour} = \\$360 \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in her income:\n\\[ \\$360 - \\$105 = \\$255 \\]\n\nTherefore, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have \\(\\boxed{255}\\) dollars more in income.",
    "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Jackie does her taxes herself: $35/hour * 3 hours = $<<35*3=105>>105\nThen subtract the accountant's charge to find how much money Janet saves: $105 - $90 = $<<105-90=15>>15\n#### 15"
