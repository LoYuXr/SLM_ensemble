    "question": "An electronics seller bought 5 phones for $700 each and gives the seller $4000 in dollar bills. How much will the seller give back in change?",
    "completion": "To determine how much change the electronics seller will give back, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the 5 phones.\n2. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money the seller gave to the seller.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so the total cost is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 700 = 3500 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money the seller gave to the seller. The seller gave $4000, so the change is:\n\\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the seller will give back \\(\\boxed{500}\\) dollars in change.",
    "answer": "The seller bought the 5 phones for $700 * 5 = $<<700*5=3500>>3500.\nSo the seller gives back $4000-$3500 = $<<4000-3500=500>>500.\n#### 500"
