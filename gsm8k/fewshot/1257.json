    "question": "Bob thinks he needs 56 popsicle sticks to recreate the Washington Monument for his history project.  His favorite popsicles come 8 to a box and cost $2.00 per box.  How much will it cost Bob to build his project?",
    "completion": "To determine how much it will cost Bob to build his project, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of popsicle sticks needed:**\n   Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks to recreate the Washington Monument.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes of popsicles Bob needs:**\n   Each box contains 8 popsicle sticks. To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{56 \\text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \\text{ popsicle sticks per box}} = 7 \\text{ boxes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   Each box costs $2.00. To find the total cost for 7 boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:\n   \\[\n   7 \\text{ boxes} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per box} = 14 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is \\(\\boxed{14}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "He needs 56 popsicle sticks to build his project and they come 8 to a box so he needs 56/8 = <<56/8=7>>7 boxes\nEach box costs $2.00 and he needs 7 boxes so it will cost him 2*7 = $<<2*7=14.00>>14.00\n#### 14"
