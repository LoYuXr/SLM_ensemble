    "question": "Verna loves to eat fruit. She bought three apples at $1.50 each, five oranges at $0.80 each, and six peaches at $0.75 each.  If she gave $20, how much change did she receive?",
    "completion": "To determine how much change Verna received, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the apples.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the oranges.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the peaches.\n4. Sum the total costs of the apples, oranges, and peaches.\n5. Subtract the total cost from the amount Verna gave her ($20).\n\nLet's start with the apples:\n- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.\n- The total cost of the apples is \\(3 \\times 1.50 = 4.50\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the oranges:\n- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.\n- The total cost of the oranges is \\(5 \\times 0.80 = 4.00\\).\n\nThen, let's calculate the cost of the peaches:\n- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.\n- The total cost of the peaches is \\(6 \\times 0.75 = 4.50\\).\n\nNow, we sum the total costs of the apples, oranges, and peaches:\n- The total cost of the apples and oranges is \\(4.50 + 4.00 = 8.50\\).\n\nFinally, we subtract the total cost from the amount Verna gave her ($20):\n- The change Verna received is \\(20.00 - 8.50 = 11.50\\).\n\nTherefore, the amount of change Verna received is \\(\\boxed{11.50}\\).",
    "answer": "Three apples cost 3 x $1.50 = $<<3*1.5=4.50>>4.50.\nFive oranges cost 5 x $0.80 = $<<5*0.8=4>>4.\nFour peaches cost 6 x $0.75 = $<<6*0.75=4.50>>4.50.\nThus, Verna paid a total of $4.50 +$4+ $4.50 = $<<4.5+4+4.5=13>>13.\nTherefore, Verna received $20 - $13 = $<<20-13=7>>7.\n#### 7"
