    "question": "A shoe store was having a weekend sale on a brand of popular tennis shoes. On Friday the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. The next day they sold double that number of shoes. On the last day of the sale they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, but six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the weekend sale, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then sum them up.\n\n1. **First Day Sales:**\n   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes on the first day.\n\n2. **Second Day Sales:**\n   - The store sold double the number of shoes on the second day compared to the first day.\n   - Number of shoes sold on the second day: \\( 14 \\times 2 = 28 \\) pairs.\n\n3. **Third Day Sales:**\n   - The store sold one-half the number of shoes on the third day compared to the second day.\n   - Number of shoes sold on the third day: \\( 28 \\div 2 = 14 \\) pairs.\n\n4. **Fourth Day Sales:**\n   - The store sold six pairs of shoes on the fourth day.\n   - Number of shoes sold on the fourth day: \\( 14 - 6 = 8 \\) pairs.\n\nNow, we sum up the number of shoes sold each day to find the total number of shoes sold by the end of the sale:\n\n\\[\n14 \\text{ (first day)} + 28 \\text{ (second day)} + 14 \\text{ (third day)} + 8 \\text{ (fourth day)} = 64 \\text{ pairs}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the weekend sale is \\(\\boxed{64}\\).",
    "answer": "On Saturday 14*2=<<14*2=28>>28 shoes were sold\nOn Sunday 28/2=<<28/2=14>>14 shoes were sold\nBefore the returns were made 14+28+14=<<14+28+14=56>>56 pairs of shoes were sold\nAfter the returns were made 56-6=<<56-6=50>>50 pairs of shoe were sold\n#### 50"
