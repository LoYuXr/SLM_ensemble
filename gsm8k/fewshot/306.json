    "question": "A bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning and half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. How many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon?",
    "completion": "To determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning.\n2. Determine the number of loaves left after the morning sales.\n3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, given that half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day, and two-thirds of them are sold in the morning. So, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 60 = 40\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the number of loaves left after the morning sales. We subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total:\n\\[\n\\text{Loaves left after morning sales} = 60 - 40 = 20\n\\]\n\nIn the afternoon, half of the remaining loaves are sold. So, we calculate half of the remaining loaves:\n\\[\n\\text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is \\boxed{10}.",
    "answer": "60 x 2/3 = <<60*2/3=40>>40 loaves of bread are sold in the morning.\n60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon and evening.\nTherefore, 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.\n#### 10"
