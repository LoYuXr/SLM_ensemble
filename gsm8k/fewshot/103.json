    "question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If the city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total distance of the city:**\n   The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.\n\n2. **Determine the coverage rate of the fog bank:**\n   The fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes.\n\n3. **Calculate the total time required to cover the entire city:**\n   To find the total time, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the coverage rate.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Coverage rate}} = \\frac{42 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ miles per 10 minutes}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the division:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{42}{3} = 14\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take 14 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.",
    "answer": "The city will be covered in 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 intervals of 10 minutes.\nThus, it will take 14 * 10 = <<14*10=140>>140 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 140"
