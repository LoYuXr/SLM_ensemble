    "question": "James buys a plane.  The plane cost $150,000.  He pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger to keep it in.  He also spends twice as much as that on fuel per month.  How much did it cost him to get and maintain the plane for the first year?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to break down the costs into two main components: the monthly rental cost and the monthly fuel cost.\n\n1. **Monthly Rental Cost:**\n   - The plane costs $150,000.\n   - James pays $5000 per month for the hanger.\n   - Therefore, the monthly rental cost is:\n     \\[\n     150,000 - 5000 = 145,000 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**\n   - James spends twice as much on fuel as the rental cost.\n   - The rental cost is $145,000.\n   - Therefore, the monthly fuel cost is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 145,000 = 290,000 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Cost for the First Year:**\n   - The total cost for the first year is the sum of the monthly rental cost and the monthly fuel cost.\n   - Therefore, the total cost is:\n     \\[\n     145,000 + 290,000 = 435,000 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is \\(\\boxed{435000}\\).",
    "answer": "The fuel cost 5000*2=$<<5000*2=10000>>10000 per month\nWith the hanger that means he pays 10000+5000=$<<10000+5000=15000>>15,000 per month\nSo he spends 12*15000=$<<12*15000=180000>>180,000 a year\nThat means the total cost was 150,000+180,000=$<<150000+180000=330000>>330,000\n#### 330000"
