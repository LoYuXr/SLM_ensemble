    "question": "John does 30 cycles of work a day.  Each cycle has 5 different tasks and each task pays $1.20.  How much does he make if he works a full 7 day week?",
    "completion": "To determine how much John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tasks John completes in a day.\n2. Determine the total number of tasks John completes in a week.\n3. Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of tasks John completes in a day.**\n\nJohn does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks. Therefore, the total number of tasks per day is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ cycles/day} \\times 5 \\text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \\text{ tasks/day} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of tasks John completes in a week.**\n\nSince John works a full 7-day week, the total number of tasks he completes in a week is:\n\\[ 150 \\text{ tasks/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 1050 \\text{ tasks/week} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.**\n\nEach task pays $1.20, so the total amount of money John makes in a week is:\n\\[ 1050 \\text{ tasks/week} \\times 1.20 \\text{ dollars/task} = 1260 \\text{ dollars/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount John makes in a week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1260} \\]",
    "answer": "Each cycle pays 5*$1.2=$<<5*1.2=6>>6\nThat means he earns $6*30=$<<6*30=180>>180 a day\nSo he makes $180*7=$<<180*7=1260>>1260 a week\n#### 1260"
