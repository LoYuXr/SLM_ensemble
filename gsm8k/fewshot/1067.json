    "question": "Anthony is sending out coupons for his pizza parlor through the mail. He wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. If each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail and each big coupon costs 15 cents, how much does he spend on postage total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of postage for Anthony's coupons, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send.\n2. Determine the total number of coupons sent.\n3. Calculate the total cost of postage for the small coupons.\n4. Calculate the total cost of postage for the big coupons.\n5. Add the costs of the small and big coupons to get the total postage cost.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Anthony wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he wants to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 700 = 1400\n   \\]\n\n2. The total number of coupons sent is the sum of the small and big coupons:\n   \\[\n   700 + 1400 = 2100\n   \\]\n\n3. The cost of postage for the small coupons is:\n   \\[\n   700 \\times 5 = 3500 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n4. The cost of postage for the big coupons is:\n   \\[\n   1400 \\times 15 = 21000 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n5. The total cost of postage is the sum of the costs of the small and big coupons:\n   \\[\n   3500 + 21000 = 24500 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\nSince 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, we can convert the total cost to dollars:\n   \\[\n   24500 \\text{ cents} = 24.50 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{24.50}\n   \\]",
    "answer": "First find the total cost of the small coupons: 700 coupons * $0.05/coupon = $<<700*0.05=35>>35\nThen find the number of big coupons Anthony sends out: 700 small * 2 big/small = <<700*2=1400>>1400 big coupons\nThen multiply the number of big coupons by the cost per big coupon to find the total cost of the big coupons: $0.15/coupon * 1400 coupons = $<<0.15*1400=210>>210\nThen add the costs of each size of coupon to find the total cost: $210 + $35 = $<<210+35=245>>245\n#### 245"
