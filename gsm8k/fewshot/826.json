    "question": "On Easter Sunday Cindy went to the city park to participate in the Easter Egg Hunt, and ended up with a basket full of eggs. She had 5 green ones, twice as many blue ones as green ones, one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, and one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. How many eggs did Cindy have altogether?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each type of egg and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Green Eggs:**\n   Cindy had 5 green eggs.\n\n2. **Blue Eggs:**\n   Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. Since she had 5 green eggs, the number of blue eggs is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 5 = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Pink Eggs:**\n   Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Since she had 10 blue eggs, the number of pink eggs is:\n   \\[\n   10 - 1 = 9\n   \\]\n\n4. **Yellow Eggs:**\n   Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Since she had 9 pink eggs, the number of yellow eggs is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{3} = 3\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum up the number of each type of egg to find the total number of eggs Cindy had:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ (green)} + 10 \\text{ (blue)} + 9 \\text{ (pink)} + 3 \\text{ (yellow)} = 27\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of eggs Cindy had is \\(\\boxed{27}\\).",
    "answer": "She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 blue eggs.\nShe has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she has 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 pink eggs.\nAnd finally, she has a third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 yellow eggs.\nAdded all together, she has 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = <<5+10+9+3=27>>27 eggs.\n#### 27"
