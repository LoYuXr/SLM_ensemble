    "question": "John just started watching a new show.  Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode.  How many minutes will John spend watching the show if he watches every episode?",
    "completion": "To determine how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of episodes:**\n   Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the total number of episodes is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total episodes} = \\frac{\\text{Number of minutes per episode}}{2} = \\frac{20 \\text{ minutes}}{2} = 10 \\text{ episodes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total time spent watching the show:**\n   Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = \\text{Number of episodes} \\times \\text{Length of each episode} = 10 \\text{ episodes} \\times 20 \\text{ minutes/episode} = 200 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total time John will spend watching the show is \\(\\boxed{200}\\) minutes.",
    "answer": "Since there are half as many episodes as the number of minutes per episode, we perform 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 episodes in total.\nSince each episode is 20 minutes long, to find the total run time we perform 10*20= <<10*20=200>>200 minutes of run time in total.\n#### 200"
