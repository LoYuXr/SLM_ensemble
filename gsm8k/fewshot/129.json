    "question": "A hospital sees 500 people a day.  Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.  The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital and the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour.  How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?",
    "completion": "To determine the profit made by the hospital from these visits, we need to calculate both the total revenue and the total cost, and then find the difference between the two.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of visits per day:\n\\[ \\text{Total visits per day} = 500 \\text{ patients} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total time spent on these visits:\n\\[ \\text{Total time per day} = 500 \\text{ patients} \\times 24 \\text{ minutes per patient} = 12000 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total revenue from the visits:\n\\[ \\text{Total revenue} = \\text{Total time} \\times \\text{Hourly rate} = 12000 \\text{ minutes} \\times 150 \\text{ dollars per hour} = 1800000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the visits:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Total time} \\times \\text{Hourly rate} = 12000 \\text{ minutes} \\times 200 \\text{ dollars per hour} = 2400000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = \\text{Total revenue} - \\text{Total cost} = 1800000 \\text{ dollars} - 2400000 \\text{ dollars} = -600000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince the profit is negative, it indicates that the hospital incurs a loss of $60,000 per day due to the high cost of the visits.",
    "answer": "The hospital sees patients for 500*24=<<500*24=12000>>12000 minutes a day\nThat means they see patients for 12000/60=<<12000/60=200>>200 hours a day\nThey profit 200-150=$<<200-150=50>>50 per hour\nSo they make a profit of 200 hours * $50/hour = $<<200*50=10000>>10000 a day from patient visits\n#### 10000"
