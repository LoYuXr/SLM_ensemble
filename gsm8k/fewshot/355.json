    "question": "There are three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet, and the second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. How tall is the tallest tree?",
    "completion": "To determine the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the height of the shortest tree.\n2. Calculate the height of the second tree.\n3. Determine the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height of the two shortest trees.\n\nLet's start with the height of the shortest tree:\nThe shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.\n\nNext, we calculate the height of the second tree:\nThe second tree has a height that is 5 feet more than the shortest tree. Therefore, the height of the second tree is:\n\\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNow, we find the combined height of the two shortest trees:\n\\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nThe height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shortest trees:\n\\[ 2 \\times 17 = 34 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nThus, the height of the tallest tree is:\n\\[ \\boxed{34} \\]",
    "answer": "The height of the second tree is 6 + 5 = <<6+5=11>>11 feet.\nThus, the combined height of the two trees is 6 + 11 = <<6+11=17>>17 feet.\nTherefore the height of the tallest tree is 2 x 17 = <<2*17=34>>34 feet.\n#### 34"
