    "question": "A wall mural has four different colors of paint in it: red, white, purple, and yellow.  There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural. Half the mural is yellow. If the mural used 12 pints of paint in all, how many pints of red paint was used?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pints of red paint were used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total amount of paint used:**\n   The mural used a total of 12 pints of paint.\n\n2. **Determine the amount of paint used for each color:**\n   Since the mural is divided into four equal parts and half of the mural is yellow, the remaining part must be used for the other three colors. Therefore, the amount of paint used for the yellow part is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12}{4} = 3 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the amount of paint used for the other three colors:**\n   The yellow part is 3 pints, and half of the mural is yellow. Therefore, the amount of paint used for the yellow part is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the amount of paint used for the red, white, and purple parts:**\n   Since the mural is divided into four equal parts and half of the mural is yellow, the remaining three parts must be used for the red, white, and purple parts. Therefore, the amount of paint used for the red, white, and purple parts is:\n   \\[\n   12 - 3 - 1.5 = 7.5 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the amount of paint used for the white part:**\n   Since the red, white, and purple parts together make up the yellow part, the white part must make up the remaining part of the yellow part. Therefore, the amount of paint used for the white part is:\n   \\[\n   3 - 1.5 = 1.5 \\text{ pints}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the amount of paint used for the red part is \\(\\boxed{7.5}\\) pints.",
    "answer": "Half the mural is yellow, so the other half took 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pints of paint.\nThe mural has equal amounts of the other three colors, so it used 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 pints of red paint.\n#### 2"
