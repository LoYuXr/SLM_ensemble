    "question": "Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time?",
    "completion": "To determine Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to work backwards from the information given.\n\n1. **Identify the age when Bill's dad saw the Comet:**\n   Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.\n\n2. **Determine the age when Bill's dad saw the Comet:**\n   Since the Comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we subtract 75 years from Bill's dad's age to find out when he saw the Comet.\n   \\[\n   30 - 75 = -45\n   \\]\n   This negative value indicates that Bill's dad saw the Comet 45 years before he was born. Therefore, Bill's dad was born 45 years before 30 years old, which is 30 - 45 = -15 years old.\n\n3. **Determine Bill's age when Bill's dad saw the Comet:**\n   Since Bill's dad was born 45 years before 30 years old, Bill's dad was 30 - 45 = -15 years old when he saw the Comet.\n\n4. **Determine Bill's age when Bill saw the Comet for the first time:**\n   Bill saw the Comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, Bill saw the Comet when he was:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 30 = 90\n   \\]\n   years old.\n\nTherefore, Bill was \\(\\boxed{90}\\) years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.",
    "answer": "Bill saw the Comet for the second time when he was 30 years * 3= <<30*3=90>>90 years old.\nComet Halley can be seen every 75 years, so Bill saw the comet for the first time when he was 90 years - 75 years = <<90-75=15>>15 years old.\n#### 15"
