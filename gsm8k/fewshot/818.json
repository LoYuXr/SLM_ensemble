    "question": "Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. He sells 20% of them and gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. If Robert has 20 cars, how many cars does joe remain with after selling and giving some to his mother?",
    "completion": "To determine how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some to his mother, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine how many cars Robert has.\n2. Calculate how many cars Joe has initially.\n3. Calculate how many cars Joe sells.\n4. Calculate how many cars Joe gives away.\n5. Determine how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some to his mother.\n\nFirst, we know that Robert has 20 cars. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, we can calculate the number of cars Joe has as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of cars Joe has} = 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cars Joe sells. Joe sells 20% of his cars, so we calculate:\n\\[ \\text{Number of cars Joe sells} = 0.20 \\times 40 = 8 \\]\n\nAfter selling 8 cars, Joe has:\n\\[ \\text{Number of cars Joe has left} = 40 - 8 = 32 \\]\n\nThen, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:\n\\[ \\text{Number of cars Joe gives away} = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\]\n\nAfter giving away 16 cars, Joe has:\n\\[ \\text{Number of cars Joe has left} = 32 - 16 = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cars Joe has left after selling and giving some to his mother is:\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]",
    "answer": "If Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has 2*20 = 40 cars.\nHe then sells 20/100*40=<<20/100*40=8>>8 cars from his car collection.\nAfter selling 8 cars, Joe remains with 40-8=<<40-8=32>>32 cars.\nJoe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother, a total of 2*8=<<2*8=16>>16 cars.\nThe number of cars that Joe has remaining after giving 16 cars to his mother is 32-16=<<32-16=16>>16\n#### 16"
