    "question": "A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days. On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?",
    "completion": "To determine how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full, we need to calculate the amount of water each person pumped and then find the total amount pumped over the two days.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of water Wanda pumped on the first day:\n\\[ \\text{Wanda's first day} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 18000 = 4500 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the first day:\n\\[ \\text{Ms. B's first day} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 4500 = 3375 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the amount of water Wanda pumped on the second day:\n\\[ \\text{Wanda's second day} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 4500 = 3000 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the second day:\n\\[ \\text{Ms. B's second day} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 3375 = 1125 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNow, let's find the total amount of water pumped over the two days:\n\\[ \\text{Total water pumped} = 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 11000 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nFinally, let's determine how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full:\n\\[ \\text{Remaining water} = 18000 - 11000 = 7000 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nThus, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is \\(\\boxed{7000}\\).",
    "answer": "On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.\nOn the same day, Ms. B pumped 3/4*4500 gallons = <<3/4*4500=3375>>3375 gallons of water into the tank.\nThey pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day\nOn the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons\nMs. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons\nTogether, on the second day, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = <<3000+1125=4125>>4125 gallons\nIn the two days, they pumped a total of 4125 gallons + 7875 gallons = <<4125+7875=12000>>12000 gallons\nThe amount of gallons remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = <<18000-12000=6000>>6000 gallons\n#### 6000"
