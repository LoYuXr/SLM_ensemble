    "question": "Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. How much more candy does Amy have after two weeks?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each of them consumes over that period and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats in two weeks. Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy each day. There are 14 days in two weeks (since two weeks is 14 days).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total candy Ginger eats} = 4 \\text{ pieces/day} \\times 14 \\text{ days} = 56 \\text{ pieces}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats in two weeks. Amy eats 3 pieces of candy each day. There are 14 days in two weeks.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total candy Amy eats} = 3 \\text{ pieces/day} \\times 14 \\text{ days} = 42 \\text{ pieces}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in the amount of candy eaten by Amy and Ginger after two weeks.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference in candy eaten} = 42 \\text{ pieces} - 56 \\text{ pieces} = -14 \\text{ pieces}\n\\]\n\nSince the difference is negative, it means Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks. Therefore, Amy has \\boxed{14} more pieces of candy than Ginger.",
    "answer": "First find the the difference in the number of pieces of candy the two people each per day: 4 pieces/day - 3 pieces/day = <<4-3=1>>1 piece/day\nThen find the number of days in 2 weeks: 2 weeks * 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14 days\nThen multiply the difference per day by the number of days to find the total difference after 14 days: 1 piece/day * 14 days = <<1*14=14>>14 pieces\n#### 14"
