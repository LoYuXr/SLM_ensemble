    "question": "Betsy and Donovan made a meal together. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. The meal was made in 98 minutes. How many minutes long was Betsy's part?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \\( x \\) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, the time Betsy spent on her part is \\( x + 18 \\) minutes.\n\nThe total time for the meal is the sum of the time Donovan spent and the time Betsy spent, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ x + (x + 18) = 98 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 2x + 18 = 98 \\]\n\nNext, we need to isolate \\( x \\). We do this by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x = 98 - 18 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 80 \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{80}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 40 \\]\n\nSo, Donovan spent 40 minutes on his part of the meal. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can find the time Betsy spent on her part by adding 18 minutes to the time Donovan spent:\n\n\\[ x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \\]\n\nTherefore, the time Betsy spent on her part of the meal is \\(\\boxed{58}\\) minutes.",
    "answer": "Let D = Donovan's time in minutes\nBetsy = D + <<+18=18>>18\n2D + 18 = 98\n2D = 80\nD = <<40=40>>40\nBetsy = 40 + 18 = <<40+18=58>>58 minutes\nBetsy's part took 58 minutes.\n#### 58"
