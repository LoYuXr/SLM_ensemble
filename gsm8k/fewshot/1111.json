    "question": "There are currently 3 red balls, 11 blue balls, and 25 green balls in the store. Red balls cost $9, Blue balls cost $5 and green balls cost $3. How much will the store have received after all the balls are sold?",
    "completion": "To determine the total revenue generated by the store after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of ball and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the revenue from the red balls:\n- There are 3 red balls.\n- Each red ball costs $9.\n- Therefore, the revenue from the red balls is \\(3 \\times 9 = 27\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue from the blue balls:\n- There are 11 blue balls.\n- Each blue ball costs $5.\n- Therefore, the revenue from the blue balls is \\(11 \\times 5 = 55\\) dollars.\n\nThen, let's calculate the revenue from the green balls:\n- There are 25 green balls.\n- Each green ball costs $3.\n- Therefore, the revenue from the green balls is \\(25 \\times 3 = 75\\) dollars.\n\nNow, we sum the revenues from all the balls to find the total revenue:\n- The total revenue is \\(27 + 55 + 75 = 157\\) dollars.\n\nThus, the total revenue generated by the store after all the balls are sold is \\(\\boxed{157}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "For the red balls, 3 balls * $9/ball = $<<3*9=27>>27.\nFor the blue balls, 11 balls * $5/ball = $<<11*5=55>>55.\nFor the green balls, 25 balls * $3/ball = $<<25*3=75>>75.\nFor all balls, $27 + $55 + $75 = $<<27+55+75=157>>157.\n#### 157"
