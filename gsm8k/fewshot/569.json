    "question": "Liam and Mitchell own competing lemonade stands across the street from one another. When Liam bragged that he had made $63 one weekend, Mitchell laughed and told Liam he had sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece the same weekend. How many more dollars did Mitchell make selling lemonade that weekend than Liam?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more dollars Mitchell made selling lemonade compared to Liam, we need to calculate the total revenue for each of them and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Liam's total revenue:\n- Liam made $63.\n- Liam sold 21 lemonades at $4 each.\n- The total revenue for Liam is calculated as follows:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total revenue for Liam} = 21 \\times 4 = 84 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate Mitchell's total revenue:\n- Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each.\n- The total revenue for Mitchell is calculated as follows:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total revenue for Mitchell} = 21 \\times 4 = 84 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between Mitchell's and Liam's total revenue:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Total revenue for Mitchell} - \\text{Total revenue for Liam} = 84 - 84 = 0 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mitchell made \\(\\boxed{0}\\) more dollars selling lemonade that weekend than Liam.",
    "answer": "Mitchell made 21 * 4 = $<<21*4=84>>84 selling lemonade.\nThus, Mitchell made 84 - 63 = $<<84-63=21>>21 more selling lemonade that weekend than Liam.\n#### 21"
