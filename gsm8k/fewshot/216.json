    "question": "Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. If she is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much will be Janeth's remaining balance by then?",
    "completion": "To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the additional amount Janeth will owe after the 10% interest.\n2. Add this additional amount to the original amount borrowed.\n3. Calculate the total amount paid over 12 months.\n4. Subtract the total amount paid from the original amount borrowed to find the remaining balance.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the additional amount Janeth will owe after the 10% interest.\n   The original amount borrowed is $2000. The interest rate is 10%, so the additional amount is:\n   \\[\n   2000 \\times 0.10 = 200\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the additional amount is $200.\n\n2. Add this additional amount to the original amount borrowed.\n   The total amount Janeth will owe is:\n   \\[\n   2000 + 200 = 2200\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the total amount paid over 12 months.\n   Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount paid is:\n   \\[\n   165 \\times 12 = 2020\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtract the total amount paid from the original amount borrowed to find the remaining balance.\n   The remaining balance is:\n   \\[\n   2200 - 2020 = 180\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then is \\(\\boxed{180}\\).",
    "answer": "Janeth will pay an additional $2000x 10/100 =$<<2000*10/100=200>>200.\nSo she is going to pay off a total of $2000 + $200 = $<<2000+200=2200>>2200.\nJaneth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.\nHence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.\n#### 220"
