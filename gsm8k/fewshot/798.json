    "question": "When Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.  After 2 months, he was given a raise of $0.50 per hour.  On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.  If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally after 20 hours of work, we need to calculate the earnings for both Billy and Sally separately and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Billy's earnings after 2 months:\n- Billy's initial hourly rate is $10.\n- After 2 months, he receives a raise of $0.50 per hour.\n- Therefore, his new hourly rate is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.\n\nNext, we calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours:\n\\[ \\text{Billy's earnings} = 20 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$10.50 \\text{ per hour} = \\$210.00 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate Sally's earnings:\n- Sally's starting hourly rate is $0.50 more than Billy's starting hourly rate.\n- Therefore, Sally's starting hourly rate is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.\n- Sally's hourly rate is $10.50.\n- Sally's earnings for 20 hours is:\n\\[ \\text{Sally's earnings} = 20 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$10.50 \\text{ per hour} = \\$210.00 \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference in their earnings:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\$210.00 - \\$210.00 = \\$0.00 \\]\n\nThus, Billy will earn \\(\\boxed{0}\\) dollars more than Sally.",
    "answer": "Billy has a salary of $10+0.50+$1.00=$<<10+0.5+1=11.50>>11.50 per hour.\nSally is paid $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, for a total of $10+$0.50=$<<10+0.5=10.50>>10.50 per hour.\nIf Billy works 20 hours, he will be paid 20*$11.50=$<<20*11.5=230>>230\nIf Sally works 20 hours, she will be paid 20*$10.50=$<<20*10.50=210>>210.\nThus, if both work 20 hours, Billy will be paid $230-$210=$20 more.\n#### 20"
