    "question": "Juan asked his neighbor, Herb, how much his house was worth. Herb answered that he paid $76,000 for the house. If Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, calculate the value of the two houses combined.",
    "completion": "To determine the value of Juan's house and Herb's house combined, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the value of Juan's house:**\n   - Herb paid $76,000 for Juan's house.\n   - Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house.\n   - To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 70% of Herb's house price ($76,000) and then subtract that from $76,000.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value of Juan's house} = 76,000 \\times (1 - 0.30)\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value of Juan's house} = 76,000 \\times 0.70\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value of Juan's house} = 53,200\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the value of Herb's house:**\n   - Herb paid $76,000 for his house.\n   - We already know the value of Juan's house is $53,200.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value of Herb's house} = 76,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the combined value of both houses:**\n   - Add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Combined value} = 53,200 + 76,000\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Combined value} = 129,200\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of the two houses combined is \\(\\boxed{129,200}\\).",
    "answer": "Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, meaning Juan's house is 30/100*$76000= $<<30/100*76000=22800>>22800 less expensive than Herb's house.\nJuan's house is worth $76000-$22800 = $<<76000-22800=53200>>53200\nThe combined total value of Juan's and Herb's house is $76000+$53200 = $<<76000+53200=129200>>129200\n#### 129200"
