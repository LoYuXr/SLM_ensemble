    "question": "Grandpa loves to eat jelly beans, but how many jelly beans he can eat depends on the size of the beans.  It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.  And eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.  How many small beans can Grandpa eat?",
    "completion": "To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the number of large jelly beans:**\n   It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Therefore, the number of large jelly beans is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of large jelly beans} = 75\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of medium-sized jelly beans:**\n   The problem states that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. Since he has 75 large jelly beans, the number of medium-sized jelly beans is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of medium-sized jelly beans} = 2 \\times 75 = 150\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of small jelly beans:**\n   The problem also states that eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean. Since we have 150 medium-sized jelly beans, the number of small jelly beans is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of small jelly beans} = \\frac{150}{3} = 50\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
    "answer": "If Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, then eating 75 large beans is the same as eating 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 medium-sized jelly beans.\nIf 1 medium-sized bean is the same as 3 small beans, then 150 medium-sized beans are equal to 150*3=<<150*3=450>>450 small jelly beans.\n#### 450"
