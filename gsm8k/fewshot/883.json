    "question": "Elaina is holding the final concert in her tour. To celebrate her final concert, she makes the concert twice as long as her usual concerts. At the end of the concert, she also performs a 15-minute encore. If the runtime of this final concert is 65 minutes then how long, in minutes, do her usual concerts run for?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \\( x \\) minutes. According to the problem, the concert she makes the final one twice as long as her usual concerts. Therefore, the runtime of the final concert is \\( 2x \\) minutes.\n\nAdditionally, Elaina performs an encore, which adds an extra 15 minutes to the total runtime. So, the total runtime of the concert is the sum of the runtime of the final concert and the encore, which is \\( 2x + 15 \\) minutes.\n\nWe are given that the total runtime of the concert is 65 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n2x + 15 = 65\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve this equation step by step. First, subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n2x = 65 - 15\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2x = 50\n\\]\n\nNext, divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{50}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 25\n\\]\n\nSo, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is \\(\\boxed{25}\\) minutes.",
    "answer": "The concert, minus the encore, lasted for 65-minute concert \u2013 15-minute encore = <<65-15=50>>50 minutes.\nThis is twice as long as her usual concerts so her usual concert must have a runtime of 50 minutes / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.\n#### 25"
