    "question": "Melanie found a blueprint online for a toothpick sculpture she wanted to make. It requires 200 toothpicks. Melanie\u2019s mom puts toothpicks in her sandwiches when she serves them for lunch. Melanie started saving them and has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. If she continues saving toothpicks at the same rate, how many more weeks will it take her to collect 200 toothpicks?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far and then find out how many more toothpicks she needs to collect.\n\nMelanie's mom puts 10 toothpicks in each sandwich. She has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ toothpicks/week} \\times 12 \\text{ weeks} = 120 \\text{ toothpicks} \\]\n\nMelanie needs 200 toothpicks to complete the sculpture. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs to collect, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ toothpicks} - 120 \\text{ toothpicks} = 80 \\text{ toothpicks} \\]\n\nSince Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we need to determine how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks. We do this by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:\n\\[ \\frac{80 \\text{ toothpicks}}{10 \\text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Melanie \\(\\boxed{8}\\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.",
    "answer": "Melanie has already saved 10 toothpicks x 12 weeks = <<10*12=120>>120 toothpicks.\nShe needs to save 200 \u2013 120 = <<200-120=80>>80 more toothpicks to reach her goal.\nShe'll have 80 toothpicks / 10 each week = in <<80/10=8>>8 more weeks.\n#### 8"
