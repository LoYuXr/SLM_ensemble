    "question": "If 6 potatoes makes 36 hash browns, how many hash browns can you make out of 96 potatoes?",
    "completion": "To determine how many hash browns you can make from 96 potatoes, we can use the concept of proportionality. The problem states that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. We need to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 hash brown. We can do this by dividing the number of hash browns by the number of hash browns per potato:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Potatoes per hash brown} = \\frac{36 \\text{ hash browns}}{36 \\text{ hash browns per potato}} = 1 \\text{ potato per hash brown}\n\\]\n\nThis means that 1 potato makes 1 hash brown. Now, we can use this information to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of hash browns from 96 potatoes} = \\frac{96 \\text{ potatoes}}{1 \\text{ potato per hash brown}} = 96 \\text{ hash browns}\n\\]\n\nSo, you can make \\boxed{96} hash browns from 96 potatoes.",
    "answer": "First find the number of hash browns per potato: 36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = <<36/6=6>>6 hash browns/potato\nThen multiply that number by the number of potatoes to find the total number of hash browns: 6 hash browns/potato * 96 potatoes = <<6*96=576>>576 hash browns\n#### 576"
