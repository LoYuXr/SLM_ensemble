    "question": "Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar.  The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches.  He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing.  He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?",
    "completion": "To determine how far off Tim's guess is, we need to calculate the expected number of red jelly beans in the jar and compare it to the actual number of red jelly beans in the container.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the volume of the jar:\n\\[\n\\text{Volume of the jar} = \\text{side length} \\times \\text{side length} \\times \\text{height} = 6 \\times 6 \\times 15 = 540 \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the expected number of red jelly beans in the jar. Since the jelly beans are packed with about 80% efficiency, the expected number of red jelly beans is:\n\\[\n\\text{Expected number of red jelly beans} = 0.8 \\times 900 = 720\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the actual number of red jelly beans in the jar. The actual number of red jelly beans is given as 900.\n\nThe difference between the expected number of red jelly beans and the actual number of red jelly beans is:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 720 - 900 = -180\n\\]\n\nSince the difference is negative, it means Tim's guess is 180 jelly beans too low. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-180}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches\nThat means it can fit 540/.15=<<540/.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans\nWith 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there\nSo that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red\nSo his guess is off by 900-864=<<900-864=36>>36\n#### 36"
