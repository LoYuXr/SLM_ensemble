    "question": "Andrew plans a road trip from New Jersey to Rochester. It takes 6 days to travel by bus and half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester. How many days will he travel if he plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the travel time for each leg of his journey and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the travel time for the bus from New Jersey to Rochester. The problem states that it takes 6 days to travel by bus. So, the travel time for the bus is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the travel time for the car from Rochester to New Jersey. The problem states that it takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus. Since the bus takes 6 days, the car takes:\n\\[ \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total travel time for the entire trip. This includes the travel time for the bus from New Jersey to Rochester and the travel time for the car from Rochester to New Jersey. Therefore, the total travel time is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ days} + 3 \\text{ days} = 9 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nSo, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]",
    "answer": "The number of days to travel by car are 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 days.\nThe total number of days for the whole trip is 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 days.\n#### 9"
