    "question": "Antoine's french onion soup recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions. He likes to double that amount. His soup serves 6 people. The onions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound. He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, that are also on sale for $2.00 a box.  What is the cost per serving? (Round to the nearest integer.)",
    "completion": "To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's french onion soup, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of onions Antoine will use:**\n   - Original recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions.\n   - Antoine wants to double the amount, so he will use \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) pounds of onions.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the onions:**\n   - The onions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound.\n   - The cost for 4 pounds is \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) dollars.\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the beef stock:**\n   - The beef stock is also on sale for $2.00 a box.\n   - Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock.\n   - The cost for 2 boxes is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) dollars.\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of the ingredients:**\n   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the onions and the cost of the beef stock.\n   - Total cost = $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (stock) = $12.00.\n\n5. **Calculate the cost per serving:**\n   - The recipe serves 6 people.\n   - The cost per serving is the total cost divided by the number of servings.\n   - Cost per serving = \\(\\frac{12.00}{6} = 2.00\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, the cost per serving is \\(\\boxed{2.00}\\).",
    "answer": "His recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions but he wants to double that amount so he needs 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 pounds of onions\nOnions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound so they will cost 4*2 = $8.00\nHe needs 2 boxes of stock which are also on sale for $2.00 so they will cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00\nThe onions are $8.00 and the stock is $4.00 for a total of 8+4 = $<<8+4=12.00>>12.00\nThe soup serves 6 people and the total cost is $12.00 so each serving is 12/6 = $<<12/6=2.00>>2.00 a serving\n#### 2"
