    "question": "Ricardo grows tomatoes and eggplants in his garden. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes while each plant of eggplant yields 4 eggplants. He planted 5 tomato plants and 8 plants of eggplant. How many fruits can Ricardo get from his plants?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of tomatoes:\n- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.\n- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.\n- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\text{ plants} \\times 22 \\text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \\text{ tomatoes}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of eggplants:\n- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.\n- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.\n- Therefore, the total number of eggplants is:\n  \\[\n  8 \\text{ plants} \\times 4 \\text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \\text{ eggplants}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:\n\\[\n110 \\text{ tomatoes} + 32 \\text{ eggplants} = 142 \\text{ fruits}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{142}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Ricardo can get 22 x 5 = <<22*5=110>>110 tomatoes.\nHe can get 4 x 8 = <<4*8=32>>32 eggplants.\nTherefore, Ricardo can get a total of 110 +32 = <<110+32=142>>142 fruits from his plants.\n#### 142"
