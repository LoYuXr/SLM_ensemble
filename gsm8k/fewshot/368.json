    "question": "After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. How many points did Erin have before?",
    "completion": "To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of points Sara scored.\n2. Determine how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points.\n3. Calculate the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points.\n\nFirst, we know that Sara scored 8 points. According to the problem, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Therefore, we can calculate the number of points Erin has after scoring 14 points as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Points Erin has after scoring 14 points} = 3 \\times \\text{Points Sara has} = 3 \\times 8 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, after scoring 14 points, Erin has 24 points. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we subtract the 14 points she has after scoring 14 points from the 24 points she has after scoring 14 points:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Points Erin had before scoring 14 points} = \\text{Points Erin has after scoring 14 points} - \\text{Points scored} = 24 - 14 = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points is \\boxed{10}.",
    "answer": "Erin now has three times more points than Sara, which is 3*8= <<3*8=24>>24 more points than Sara.\nThis means Erin has a total of 8+24 = <<8+24=32>>32 points now.\nBefore, Erin had 32-14= <<32-14=18>>18 points\n#### 18"
