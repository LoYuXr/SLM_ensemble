    "question": "Billy is buying some candy with $10 his father gave him. The candy costs $1.5 a pound. After buying candy, he takes half his change and spends it on gumballs, which cost $.05 each. If he bought 40 gumballs, how many pounds of candy did he buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Billy spent on candy.\n2. Determine how much change he received after buying the candy.\n3. Use the change to find out how much money he spent on gumballs.\n4. Calculate how many gumballs he bought.\n5. Determine how many pounds of candy he bought.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Billy spent on candy.\n   Billy's father gave him $10, and the candy costs $1.5 per pound.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of candy} = 10 - 1.5 = 8.5 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine how much change he received after buying the candy.\n   Billy took half his change and spent it on gumballs.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Change} = \\frac{8.5}{2} = 4.25 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. Use the change to find out how much money he spent on gumballs.\n   Billy spent $4.25 on gumballs.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money spent on gumballs} = 4.25 - 4.25 = 0 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate how many gumballs he bought.\n   Since each gumball costs $0.05, the number of gumballs he bought is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of gumballs} = \\frac{0}{0.05} = 0\n   \\]\n\n5. Determine how many pounds of candy he bought.\n   Since he bought 0 gumballs, he bought 0 pounds of candy.\n\nTherefore, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",
    "answer": "He spent $2 on gumballs because 40 x .05 = <<40*.05=2>>2\nHe had $4 in change because 2 / .5 = <<2/.5=4>>4\nHe spent $6 on candy because 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6\nHe bought 4 pounds of candy because 6 / 1.5 = <<6/1.5=4>>4\n#### 4"
