    "question": "Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the following year he starts buying 2 games a month.  For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?",
    "completion": "To determine how many games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the total number of games he buys each year and then sum them up.\n\n1. **First Year:**\n   - Steve buys 1 game per month.\n   - There are 12 months in a year.\n   - Total games bought in the first year: \\( 1 \\text{ game/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months} = 12 \\text{ games} \\).\n\n2. **Second Year:**\n   - Steve buys 2 games per month.\n   - There are 12 months in a year.\n   - Total games bought in the second year: \\( 2 \\text{ games/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months} = 24 \\text{ games} \\).\n\n3. **Third Year:**\n   - Steve buys 4 games per month.\n   - There are 12 months in a year.\n   - Total games bought in the third year: \\( 4 \\text{ games/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months} = 48 \\text{ games} \\).\n\nNow, we sum up the total number of games bought over the three years:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ games} + 24 \\text{ games} + 48 \\text{ games} = 84 \\text{ games} \\]\n\nTherefore, after 3 years, Steve has a total of 84 games.",
    "answer": "Steve buys 1 game a month his first year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*1=<<1*12=12>>12 games\nSteve then buys 2 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*2=<<2*12=24>>24 games\nSteve then buys 4 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*4=<<4*12=48>>48 games\nSteve also gets 5 games for Christmas each year for three years, for another 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 games.\nIn total over three years, Steve gets 12+24+48+15=<<12+24+48+15=99>>99 games\nSince Steve started with 5 games, he has 5+99=<<5+99=104>>104 games after 3 years\n#### 104"
