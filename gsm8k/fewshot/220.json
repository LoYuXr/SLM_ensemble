    "completion": "To determine the total time Carmen spent playing crossword and sudoku puzzles, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time spent on the crossword puzzles:\n- Carmen solved 3 crossword puzzles.\n- Each crossword puzzle takes 10 minutes to solve.\n- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\text{ puzzles} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes per puzzle} = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time spent on the sudoku puzzles:\n- Carmen solved 8 sudoku puzzles.\n- Each sudoku puzzle takes 5 minutes to solve.\n- Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is:\n  \\[\n  8 \\text{ puzzles} \\times 5 \\text{ minutes per puzzle} = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ minutes} + 40 \\text{ minutes} = 70 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{70 \\text{ minutes}}\n\\]",
