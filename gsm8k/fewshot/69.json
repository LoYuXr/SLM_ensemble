    "question": "Bailey starts with a certain amount of money. Then she receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. At the end of the 8 weeks, if she has a total of $100, how much money did Bailey start with?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Bailey started with, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Bailey received from her weekly allowance over 8 weeks.\n2. Add this total to the amount of money she has at the end of the 8 weeks.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Bailey received from her weekly allowance over 8 weeks. Since she receives $5 per week for 8 weeks, we can calculate this as follows:\n\n\\[ 5 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 8 \\text{ weeks} = 40 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we add this total to the amount of money she has at the end of the 8 weeks. According to the problem, at the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has $100. So, we add $40 to $100:\n\n\\[ 100 \\text{ dollars} + 40 \\text{ dollars} = 140 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Bailey started with \\(\\boxed{140}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "In 8 weeks, Bailey receives $5 * 8 = $<<5*8=40>>40 in allowance\nBailey started with $100 - $40 = $<<100-40=60>>60\n#### 60"
