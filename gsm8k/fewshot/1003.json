    "question": "A dance studio offers lessons to students. It costs $25 per session to rent the studio plus $1.50 per student per session. At present, the dance studio has 10 students and is rented 3 days a week. How much are the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month?",
    "completion": "To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total number of sessions and the total earnings from those sessions.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of sessions per week:\n- The dance studio is rented 3 days a week.\n- Each session costs $25 to rent.\n- Therefore, the number of sessions per week is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Sessions per week} = 3 \\text{ days/week} \\times 25 \\text{ dollars/session} = 75 \\text{ sessions/week}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of sessions per month:\n- There are 4 weeks in a month.\n- Therefore, the number of sessions per month is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Sessions per month} = 75 \\text{ sessions/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 300 \\text{ sessions/month}\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total earnings per month:\n- Each session is rented for $25.\n- Therefore, the total earnings per month is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total earnings per month} = 300 \\text{ sessions/month} \\times 25 \\text{ dollars/session} = 7500 \\text{ dollars/month}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are \\(\\boxed{7500}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "The total earnings from 10 students is $1.50 x 10 = $<<1.50*10=15>>15 per session.\nSo the total earnings per session is $15 + $25 = $<<15+25=40>>40.\nThus, every week the dance studio earns $40 x 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.\nTherefore, it will earn $120 x 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480 in a month.\n#### 480"
