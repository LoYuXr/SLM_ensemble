    "question": "Ali is a dean of a private school where he teaches one class. John is also a dean of a public school. John has two classes in his school. Each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali\u2019s class which has the capacity of 120 students. What is the combined capacity of both schools?",
    "completion": "To determine the combined capacity of both schools, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the capacity of John's class:**\n   - John's class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class.\n   - Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.\n   - Therefore, the capacity of John's class is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{8} \\times 120 = 15 \\text{ students}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the combined capacity of both schools:**\n   - Both schools have the same capacity.\n   - The combined capacity is:\n     \\[\n     120 \\text{ students} + 15 \\text{ students} = 135 \\text{ students}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the combined capacity of both schools is \\(\\boxed{135}\\).",
    "answer": "Each of John\u2019s classes has a capacity of 120 * 1/8 = <<120*1/8=15>>15 students.\nCombined, both his classes have a capacity of 15 * 2= <<15*2=30>>30 students.\nCombined, both schools have a capacity of 120+30=<<120+30=150>>150 students\n#### 150"
