    "question": "Four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. If two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars, how much did each of the other two pizzas cost if they cost the same amount?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost of each of the other two pizzas, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each:**\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 30 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the cost of the remaining two pizzas:**\n   \\[\n   64 - 60 = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, each of the other two pizzas cost \\(\\boxed{2}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "The other two pizzas cost 64-30 = <<64-30=34>>34 dollars.\nEach of the other two pizzas cost 34/2 = <<34/2=17>>17 dollars each.\n#### 17"
