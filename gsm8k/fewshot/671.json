    "question": "Adam went to a store to buy some sweets. He bought 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B. One candy of type A costs $0.5, and one candy of type B costs $0.75. How much change did Adam get, if he paid the cashier $15?",
    "completion": "To determine how much change Adam received, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.\n2. Subtract the total cost from the amount Adam paid to find the change.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the candies. Adam bought 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B. The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5, and the cost of one candy of type B is $0.75. Therefore, the total cost for the candies is:\n\n\\[ 7 \\times 0.5 + 10 \\times 0.75 \\]\n\nCalculating each part separately:\n\n\\[ 7 \\times 0.5 = 3.5 \\]\n\\[ 10 \\times 0.75 = 7.5 \\]\n\nAdding these amounts together gives:\n\n\\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \\]\n\nSo, the total cost of the candies is $11. Adam paid $15. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount Adam paid:\n\n\\[ 15 - 11 = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the change Adam received is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
    "answer": "For type A candies Adam needed to pay 7 * 0.5 = $<<7*0.5=3.5>>3.5.\nFor the other type of candies, Adam needed to pay 10 * 0.75 = $<<10*0.75=7.5>>7.5.\nSo Adam had to pay 3.5 + 7.5 = $<<3.5+7.5=11>>11 in total for his shopping.\nIf Adam gave the cashier $15, that means he got 15 - 11 = $<<15-11=4>>4 of change.\n#### 4"
