    "question": "Carl has a cane that is half as long as he is tall.  Carl is one foot taller than his brother, Ned.  And Ned is two feet shorter than his cousin, Isabel.  If Isabel is 7 feet tall, how long is Carl's cane, in feet?",
    "completion": "To determine the length of Carl's cane, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Determine Isabel's height:**\n   Isabel is 7 feet tall.\n\n2. **Determine Ned's height:**\n   Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ned's height} = 7 \\text{ feet} - 2 \\text{ feet} = 5 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine Carl's height:**\n   Carl is one foot taller than Ned.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Carl's height} = 5 \\text{ feet} + 1 \\text{ foot} = 6 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the length of Carl's cane:**\n   Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cane's length} = \\frac{\\text{Carl's height}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the length of Carl's cane is \\(\\boxed{3}\\) feet.",
    "answer": "If Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, then Ned is 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 feet tall.\nIf Carl is one foot taller than Ned, then Carl is 5+1=<<5+1=6>>6 feet tall.\nCarl's cane is half as long as he is tall, or 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 feet long.\n#### 3"
