    "question": "If John scored 100 on his first 3 tests and an 80 on his 4th, what was his average score across the 4 tests?",
    "completion": "To calculate John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Sum the scores**: Add up all the scores John got on his tests.\n   - First test: 100\n   - Second test: 100\n   - Third test: 100\n   - Fourth test: 80\n\n   \\[\n   100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380\n   \\]\n\n2. **Count the number of tests**: John took 4 tests.\n\n3. **Calculate the average**: Divide the total sum of the scores by the number of tests.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average score} = \\frac{\\text{Total sum of scores}}{\\text{Number of tests}} = \\frac{380}{4} = 95\n   \\]\n\nSo, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95.",
    "answer": "100+100+100+80=<<100+100+100+80=380>>380 total score across 4 tests\n380 total score / 4 tests = <<380/4=95>>95 average score\n#### 95"
