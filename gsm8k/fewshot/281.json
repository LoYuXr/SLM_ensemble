    "question": "A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba. If there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in a snake park, what is half the number of spots they all have combined?",
    "completion": "To determine half the number of spots that the cobras and mambas have combined, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of spots on a mamba.\n2. Determine the total number of spots for both cobras and mambas.\n3. Find half the total number of spots.\n\nFirst, we know that a cobra has 70 spots. Since a mamba has twice as many spots as a cobra, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba as follows:\n\\[ 70 \\times 2 = 140 \\text{ spots} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of spots for both cobras and mambas. Since there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, the total number of spots is:\n\\[ 40 \\times 70 + 60 \\times 140 = 2800 + 8400 = 11200 \\text{ spots} \\]\n\nFinally, we find half of the total number of spots:\n\\[ \\frac{11200}{2} = 5600 \\text{ spots} \\]\n\nThus, half the number of spots they all have combined is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5600} \\]",
    "answer": "A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba, meaning a mamba has 70/2= <<70/2=35>>35 spots.\nIf there are 40 cobras in a snake park, they all have a total of 70*40 = <<40*70=2800>>2800 spots.\n60 mambas in a snake park, each having 35 spots, have 60*35 = <<60*35=2100>>2100 spots total.\nTogether, all the snakes in the park have 2100+2800=<<2100+2800=4900>>4900 spots.\nHalf the number of spots they all have combined is 1/2*4900=<<1/2*4900=2450>>2450\n#### 2450"
