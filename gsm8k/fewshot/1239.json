    "question": "A custodian has to clean a school with 80 classrooms. They have 5 days to get it done. It takes them 15 minutes per classroom. If they work an 8 hour day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms?",
    "completion": "To determine the percentage of their day that is spent cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of minutes spent cleaning classrooms in one day.\n2. Determine the total number of minutes spent cleaning classrooms in 80 classrooms.\n3. Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes spent cleaning classrooms in one day.**\n\nSince it takes 15 minutes per classroom and there are 80 classrooms, the total number of minutes spent cleaning classrooms in one day is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ minutes/classroom} \\times 80 \\text{ classrooms} = 1200 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of minutes spent cleaning classrooms in 80 classrooms.**\n\nSince the total number of minutes spent cleaning classrooms in one day is 1200 minutes, the total number of minutes spent cleaning classrooms in 80 classrooms is:\n\\[ 1200 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms.**\n\nThe percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms is calculated by dividing the total number of minutes spent cleaning classrooms by the total number of minutes in a day (24 hours) and then multiplying by 100:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{1200 \\text{ minutes}}{24 \\text{ hours}} \\right) \\times 100 = 500\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of their day that is spent cleaning classrooms is \\(\\boxed{500}\\).",
    "answer": "They have to clean 16 classrooms a day because 80 / 5 = <<80/5=16>>16\nThey spend 240 minutes cleaning per day because 16 x 15 = <<16*15=240>>240\nThey spend 4 hours a day because 240 / 60 = <<240/60=4>>4\nThey spend half their day cleaning classrooms because 4 / 8 = <<4/8=.5>>.5\nThey spend 50% of their day cleaning classrooms because .5 x 100 = <<.5*100=50>>50\n#### 50"
