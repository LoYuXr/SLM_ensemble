    "question": "Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.  Lamar finds 5 eggs. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar.  Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy.  And Mei finds half as many as Charlie.  How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?",
    "completion": "To determine how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we need to calculate the number of eggs each person finds and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Cole's Eggs:**\n   Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, Cole hid:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 12 = 36 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Lamar's Eggs:**\n   Lamar finds 5 eggs.\n\n3. **Stacy's Eggs:**\n   Stacy finds twice as many eggs as Lamar. Since Lamar found 5 eggs, Stacy found:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Charlie's Eggs:**\n   Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy. Since Stacy found 10 eggs, Charlie found:\n   \\[\n   10 - 2 = 8 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Mei's Eggs:**\n   Mei finds half as many eggs as Charlie. Since Charlie found 8 eggs, Mei found:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Total Eggs Hidden:**\n   Now, we sum up all the eggs found by Cole, Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:\n   \\[\n   36 + 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 63 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{63}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Cole hides 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 eggs.\nLamar finds 5 eggs.\nStacy finds 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 eggs.\nCharlie finds 10 - 2 = <<10-2=8>>8 eggs.\nMei finds 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 eggs.\nThe children find a total of 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = <<5+10+8+4=27>>27 eggs.\nThe total number of hidden eggs still in the yard is 36 - 27 = <<36-27=9>>9 eggs.\n#### 9"
