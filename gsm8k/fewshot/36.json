    "question": "Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.  They are currently on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00.  How much does he spend on yogurt over 30 days?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:**\n   - Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.\n   - Over 30 days, he eats \\( 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\) yogurts.\n\n2. **Determine the cost of the yogurts:**\n   - The current price of 4 yogurts is $5.00.\n   - To find the cost per yogurt, we divide the total cost by the number of yogurts:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost per yogurt} = \\frac{5.00}{4} = 1.25 \\text{ dollars per yogurt}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts:**\n   - Multiply the cost per yogurt by the number of yogurts:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost} = 1.25 \\times 60 = 75 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Terry spends \\(\\boxed{75}\\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days.",
    "answer": "He eats 2 yogurts a day so over 30 days he will need 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 yogurts\nThe yogurt is sold as 4 units for $5.00 and he needs 60 yogurts so that\u2019s 60/4 = <<60/4=15>>15 4-packs\nEach 4-pack is $5.00 and he needs 15 4-packs so he will spend $5*15 = $<<5*15=75.00>>75.00 on yogurt\n#### 75"
