    "question": "There is space for 20 pencils in the box. If there are 4 pencils missing from the box, how many pairs of pencils are in the box?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of pencils in the box.\n2. Identify the number of pencils that are missing.\n3. Calculate the number of pencils that are present in the box.\n4. Determine the number of pairs of pencils based on the number of pencils present.\n\nLet's go through these steps in detail:\n\n1. The total number of pencils in the box is 20.\n2. The number of pencils that are missing is 4.\n3. The number of pencils present in the box is the total number of pencils minus the number of pencils that are missing:\n   \\[\n   20 - 4 = 16\n   \\]\n4. Each pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils. Therefore, the number of pairs of pencils is the number of pencils present divided by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{16}{2} = 8\n   \\]\n\nSo, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
    "answer": "In the box there are 20 pencils - 4 pencils = <<20-4=16>>16 pencils.\nDividing into pairs we have 16 pencils / 2 pencils/pair = 8 pairs of pencils\n#### 8"
