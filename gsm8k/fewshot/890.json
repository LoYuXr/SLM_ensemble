    "question": "There are 100 plants in Mrs. Smith's garden. One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining are outdoor plants while the rest are flowering plants. What percent of the plants are flowering plants?",
    "completion": "To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of indoor plants.\n2. Determine the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants.\n3. Calculate the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants.\n4. Determine the number of flowering plants from the remaining plants.\n5. Calculate the percentage of flowering plants.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of indoor plants:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of indoor plants} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 100 = 25\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of outdoor plants} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 75 = 50\n   \\]\n\n4. Determine the number of flowering plants from the remaining plants:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25\n   \\]\n\n5. Calculate the percentage of flowering plants:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \\left( \\frac{25}{100} \\right) \\times 100 = 25\\%\n   \\]\n\nThus, the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
    "answer": "There are 100 x 1/4 = <<100*1/4=25>>25 indoor plants.\nSo, 100 - 25 = <<100-25=75>>75 plants are not indoor plants.\nThere are 75 x 2/3 = <<75*2/3=50>>50 outdoor plants.\nAnd 75 - 50 = <<75-50=25>>25 flowering plants.\nThus, 25/100 x 100% = 25% of the plants are flowering plants.\n#### 25"
