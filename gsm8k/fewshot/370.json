    "question": "A hand-painted wallpaper costs $400 at the market. A DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost. If Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, how much was the total cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of Ethan's DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper:**\n   The original cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $400.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the materials:**\n   The DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost. This means that the DIY will cost 80% of the original cost.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of materials} = 400 \\times (1 - 0.20) = 400 \\times 0.80 = 320\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   The total cost is the sum of the cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper and the cost of the materials.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 400 + 320 = 720\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Ethan's DIY hand-painted wallpaper is \\(\\boxed{720}\\).",
    "answer": "A DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost, meaning you will save 20/100*$400=$<<20/100*400=80>>80 if you make your own hand-painted wallpaper.\nThe total cost of a hand-painted wallpaper made at home is $400-$80 = $<<400-80=320>>320\n#### 320"
