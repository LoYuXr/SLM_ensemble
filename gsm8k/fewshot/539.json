    "question": "My wife wants to evenly split the check but wants me to pay an additional 20% tip on our $50 dinner bill. How much did I end up paying?",
    "completion": "To determine how much you ended up paying, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the dinner including the tip.\n2. Divide the total cost by 2 to find out how much each person should pay.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the dinner including the tip.\n   - The original cost of the dinner is $50.\n   - The tip is 20% of $50.\n   - The tip amount is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Tip} = 0.20 \\times 50 = 10\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total cost of the dinner including the tip is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost} = 50 + 10 = 60\n     \\]\n\n2. Divide the total cost by 2 to find out how much each person should pay.\n   - The total cost is $60.\n   - You want to pay an additional 20% tip on the $60.\n   - The tip amount is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Tip} = 0.20 \\times 60 = 12\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the amount you should pay is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Amount per person} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n     \\]\n\nSo, you ended up paying \\(\\boxed{30}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "If the total bill is $50, the total tip of 20% would be $50*20% = $<<50*20*.01=10>>10\nSimilarly, if the bill was $50 an even split (1/2) would be $50 * 1/2 = $<<50*1/2=25>>25 to be paid by each person\nThat means I paid $25 for the bill + $10 for the tip = $<<25+10=35>>35\n#### 35"
