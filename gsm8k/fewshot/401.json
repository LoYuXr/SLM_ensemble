    "question": "A builder works for 4 weeks every month and for 6 days every week. If he gets paid $50 every day, how much does he earn if he works for a year?",
    "completion": "To determine how much the builder earns in a year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.\n2. Calculate the total number of days the builder works in a year.\n3. Calculate the total amount of money the builder earns in a year.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.**\n\nThe builder works for 4 weeks every month and for 6 days every week. There are 12 months in a year, so the number of days he works in a year is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ weeks/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} \\times 6 \\text{ days/week} = 288 \\text{ days/year} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of days the builder works in a year.**\n\nSince there are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years for simplicity), the total number of days he works in a year is:\n\\[ 288 \\text{ days/year} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money the builder earns in a year.**\n\nThe builder earns $50 every day. Therefore, the total amount of money he earns in a year is:\n\\[ 288 \\text{ days/year} \\times 50 \\text{ dollars/day} = 14400 \\text{ dollars/year} \\]\n\nSo, the builder earns \\(\\boxed{14400}\\) dollars in a year.",
    "answer": "The builder works for 6 days every week and works for 4 weeks every month so he works for 6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = <<6*4=24>>24 days/month\nIf he earns $50 every day he then earns $50/day * 24 days/month = $<<50*24=1200>>1200/month\nA year is equal to 12 months so every year he earns $1200/month * 12 months/year = $<<1200*12=14400>>14400\n#### 14400"
