    "question": "While playing with her friends in their school playground, Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest. After about twenty minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. How many fairies are remaining?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of fairies remaining, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of fairies:**\n   Katelyn saw 50 fairies.\n\n2. **Fairies seen by one friend:**\n   One of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, her friend saw:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\text{ fairies}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Fairies remaining after the friend's visit:**\n   After her friend saw 25 fairies, the number of fairies remaining is:\n   \\[\n   50 - 25 = 25 \\text{ fairies}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fairies that flew away:**\n   Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. The number of fairies remaining after these 30 fairies flew away is:\n   \\[\n   25 - 30 = -5 \\text{ fairies}\n   \\]\n\nSince the number of fairies cannot be negative, it means that all the fairies that flew away were already gone. Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Katelyn's friend saw 1/2*50 = <<1/2*50=25>>25, half as many fairies as Katelyn initially saw\nThe total number of fairies flying above the forest now is 50 + 25 = <<50+25=75>>75\nIf thirty fairies then flew away, there were 75 - 30 = <<75-30=45>>45 fairies that remained.\n#### 45"
