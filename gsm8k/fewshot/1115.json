    "question": "Anna is trying to buy books for her local library. She had a budget of $16, and she has already spent $4. She also bought 2 books today, and both books cost her the same amount of money. If Anna has $2 left in her budget, how much did each of the books cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost of each book, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount spent on books:**\n   - Anna initially had a budget of $16.\n   - She spent $4 on the first book.\n   - She spent $4 on the second book.\n   - Therefore, the total amount spent on books is:\n     \\[\n     4 + 4 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total amount spent on the books and the remaining budget:**\n   - Anna has $2 left in her budget after buying the books.\n   - The total amount spent on the books is $8.\n   - Therefore, the remaining budget is:\n     \\[\n     16 - 8 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of each book:**\n   - Anna bought 2 books, and the total cost of these books is $8.\n   - Therefore, the cost of each book is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{8 \\text{ dollars}}{2 \\text{ books}} = 4 \\text{ dollars per book}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the cost of each book is \\(\\boxed{4}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Anna had already spent some money, so she started the day with $16 \u2013 $4 = $<<16-4=12>>12.\nShe has money left in the budget, so she spent a total of $12 \u2013 $2 = $<<12-2=10>>10 on the books.\nTherefore each book cost her $10 / 2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.\n#### 5"
