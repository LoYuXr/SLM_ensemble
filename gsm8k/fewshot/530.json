    "question": "After tracking his workout routine for 8 weeks, Josh discovered that he had spent 4 hours working out every week except on some occasions. At one point, he spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks. Another time, he spent 6 hours in one week. What is the total number of hours he has spent working out across the 8 weeks?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.\n\n1. **Identify the hours spent in each week:**\n   - Josh spent 4 hours working out every week except on some occasions.\n   - He spent 5 hours working out on one specific week.\n   - He spent 6 hours working out on another specific week.\n\n2. **Calculate the total hours spent in the first 2 weeks:**\n   - He spent 4 hours each week for 2 weeks.\n   - Total hours in the first 2 weeks = \\(4 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 8 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the total hours spent in the remaining 6 weeks:**\n   - He spent 5 hours each week for 6 weeks.\n   - Total hours in the remaining 6 weeks = \\(5 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 6 \\text{ weeks} = 30 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\n4. **Sum the total hours spent over the 8 weeks:**\n   - Total hours = Total hours in the first 2 weeks + Total hours in the remaining 6 weeks.\n   - Total hours = \\(8 \\text{ hours} + 30 \\text{ hours} = 38 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",
    "answer": "For 2 weeks, he spent 5 hours each for a total of 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 hours\nIn another week, he spent 6 hours; which gives a total of 10+6 = <<10+6=16>>16 hours\n2+1 = <<2+1=3>>3 weeks have been accounted for\nHe tracked 8 weeks so there are 8-3 = <<8-3=5>>5 weeks left\nHe spent 4 hours each week for 5 weeks for a total of 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20 hours\nThe total across the 8 weeks is: 16+20 = <<16+20=36>>36 hours\n#### 36"
