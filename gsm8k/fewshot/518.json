    "question": "Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has and uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. Calculate the amount of money he has after buying the dinner.",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.\n2. Determine how much money Ali gives to his sister.\n3. Calculate the remaining amount of money after giving half to his sister.\n4. Determine how much money Ali uses to buy dinner.\n5. Calculate the remaining amount of money after buying dinner.\n\nLet's start with the initial amount of money Ali has:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ $10 bills} + 6 \\text{ $20 bills} = 4 \\times 10 + 6 \\times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate how much money Ali gives to his sister:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 160 = 80 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the remaining amount of money after giving half to his sister:\n\\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThen, we determine how much money Ali uses to buy dinner:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{5} \\times 80 = \\frac{3 \\times 80}{5} = \\frac{240}{5} = 48 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the remaining amount of money after buying dinner:\n\\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]",
    "answer": "Four $10 bills have a value of 4*$10 =$<<4*10=40>>40\nThe six $20 bills also are worth 6*$20 = $<<6*20=120>>120\nAli has $40+$120 = $<<40+120=160>>160\nWhen he gives his sister half of the money, he remains with the other half, which totals 1/2*$160 = $<<1/2*160=80>>80\nHe then spends 3/5*$80 = $<<3/5*80=48>>48 on dinner.\nThe total amount of money that Ali has now is $80-$48 = $<<80-48=32>>32\n#### 32"
