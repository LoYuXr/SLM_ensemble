    "question": "A football team has 105 members.  There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.  How many players are on the defense?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of players on the defense, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( D \\) as the number of players on the defense.\n- \\( O \\) as the number of players on the offense.\n- \\( S \\) as the number of players on the special teams.\n\nFrom the problem, we know the following:\n1. The total number of players on the team is 105.\n2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense.\n3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.\n\nWe can translate these statements into equations:\n1. \\( D + O + S = 105 \\)\n2. \\( O = 2D \\)\n3. \\( S = \\frac{1}{2}D \\)\n\nFirst, substitute \\( O \\) and \\( S \\) from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:\n\\[ D + 2D + \\frac{1}{2}D = 105 \\]\n\nCombine the terms involving \\( D \\):\n\\[ D + 2D + \\frac{1}{2}D = 105 \\]\n\\[ 3D + \\frac{1}{2}D = 105 \\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 3D + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}D = 2 \\cdot 105 \\]\n\\[ 6D + D = 210 \\]\n\\[ 7D = 210 \\]\n\nSolve for \\( D \\):\n\\[ D = \\frac{210}{7} \\]\n\\[ D = 30 \\]\n\nThus, the number of players on the defense is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
    "answer": "Let x represent the number of players on the defense\nOffense:2x\nSpecial Teams:(1/2)x\nTotal:x+2x+(1/2)x=105\n(7/2)x=105\nx=105(2/7)=30 players\n#### 30"
