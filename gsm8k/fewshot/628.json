    "question": "Adam really wants to ride the biggest roller coaster at the park. You have to be 4 feet tall to ride it. Adam\u2019s height is 40 inches and he grows 2 inches a year. How many years until he is tall enough to ride it?",
    "completion": "To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the biggest roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert Adam's current height to inches:**\n   Adam's current height is 40 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert this to feet:\n   \\[\n   40 \\text{ inches} = 4 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the height difference needed to ride the roller coaster:**\n   The roller coaster is 100 feet tall (since it's the tallest roller coaster in the park). Adam's current height is 4 feet. The difference in height needed is:\n   \\[\n   100 \\text{ feet} - 4 \\text{ feet} = 96 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of years required to grow 96 feet:**\n   Adam grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take to grow 96 feet, we divide the total height needed by his growth rate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{96 \\text{ feet}}{2 \\text{ inches/year}} = 48 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Adam 48 years to grow tall enough to ride the biggest roller coaster.",
    "answer": "Adam needs to grow 8 inches because 48 -40= <<48-40=8>>8\nIt will take 4 years because 8/2=<<8/2=4>>4\n#### 4"
