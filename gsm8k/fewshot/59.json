    "question": "A raspberry bush has 6 clusters of 20 fruit each and 67 individual fruit scattered across the bush. How many raspberries are there total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of raspberries on the raspberry bush, we need to consider both the clusters and the scattered individual fruit. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of fruit clusters:**\n   - There are 6 clusters, and each cluster contains 20 fruit.\n   - Total number of fruit clusters = \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of individual fruit:**\n   - There are 67 individual fruit scattered across the bush.\n   - Total number of individual fruit = 67.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of raspberries:**\n   - Total number of raspberries = Total number of fruit clusters + Total number of individual fruit.\n   - Total number of raspberries = \\(120 + 67 = 187\\).\n\nThus, the total number of raspberries on the raspberry bush is \\(\\boxed{187}\\).",
    "answer": "First find the number of fruit in clusters: 20 fruit/cluster * 6 clusters = <<20*6=120>>120 fruit\nThen add the number of individual fruit to find the total number of fruit: 120 fruit + 67 fruit = <<120+67=187>>187 fruit\n#### 187"
