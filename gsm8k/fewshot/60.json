    "question": "A basket contains 25 oranges among which 1 is bad, 20% are unripe, 2 are sour and the rest are good. How many oranges are good?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of good oranges in the basket, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of oranges in the basket.\n2. Determine the number of unripe oranges.\n3. Determine the number of sour oranges.\n4. Subtract the number of unripe and sour oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The total number of oranges in the basket is 25.\n2. The number of unripe oranges is 20% of the total number of oranges. To find this, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   20\\% \\text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \\times 25 = 5\n   \\]\n   So, there are 5 unripe oranges.\n3. The number of sour oranges is given as 2.\n4. To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of unripe and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:\n   \\[\n   25 - 5 - 2 = 18\n   \\]\n   So, there are 18 good oranges.\n\nTherefore, the number of good oranges is \\boxed{18}.",
    "answer": "20% of 25 oranges is (20/100)*25 = <<(20/100)*25=5>>5 oranges\nThe total number of bad, unripe and sour oranges is therefore 1+5+2 = <<1+5+2=8>>8 oranges\nThe rest which is 25-8 = <<25-8=17>>17 oranges are good\n#### 17"
