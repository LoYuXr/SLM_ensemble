    "question": "Kayla is having her birthday party at a movie theater. The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Kayla invited her 25 classmates and the 7 girls in her dance class, as well as 13 family members. Only 4 people said they could not come. How much will the party cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of Kayla's birthday party, we need to calculate the cost based on the number of guests and then subtract the number of people who could not attend.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of guests:\n- Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls in her dance class.\n- Kayla invited 13 family members.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of guests is:\n\\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the cost for the party. The cost to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20 guests. Since Kayla invited 45 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests:\n\\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \\]\nSo, the cost for the additional guests is $6 per additional guest. Therefore, the total cost for the additional guests is:\n\\[ 25 \\times 6 = 150 \\]\n\nNow, we add the cost for the party of 20 guests and the cost for the additional guests to get the total cost:\n\\[ 125 + 150 = 275 \\]\n\nThus, the total cost of the party is:\n\\[ \\boxed{275} \\]",
    "answer": "Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class friends + 13 family members = <<25+7+13=45>>45 people invited.\nOf the 45 people invited \u2013 4 people cannot come = <<45-4=41>>41 people attending the party.\nOf the 41 people attending \u2013 20 are included in the fee = <<41-20=21>>21 additional guests not included in the fee.\nThe cost for 21 additional guests is 21 x $6 = $<<21*6=126>>126.\nThe total cost for the party is the $125 fee + $126 for additional guests = $<<125+126=251>>251.\n#### 251"
