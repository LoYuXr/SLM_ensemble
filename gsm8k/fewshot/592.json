    "question": "Marilyn wants to buy a pair of boots online. On Amazon.com, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4. On eBay, those same pair of shoes are only $13, but shipping costs twice as much as it does on Amazon. How much more expensive do the boots work out to be on eBay?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on Amazon:\n- The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.\n- The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.\n- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is:\n  \\[\n  16 + 4 = 20\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on eBay:\n- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.\n- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon, which is twice $4. Therefore, the shipping cost on eBay is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 4 = 8\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is:\n  \\[\n  13 + 8 = 21\n  \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon:\n- The total cost on Amazon is $20.\n- The total cost on eBay is $21.\n- The difference in cost is:\n  \\[\n  21 - 20 = 1\n  \\]\n\nThus, the boots are \\(\\boxed{1}\\) dollar more expensive on eBay compared to Amazon.",
    "answer": "The total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $<<16+4=20>>20\nShipping on eBay costs $4 x 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8\nThe total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $<<13+8=21>>21\nThe boots cost $21 - $20 = $<<21-20=1>>1 more on eBay\n#### 1"
