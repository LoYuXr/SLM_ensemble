    "question": "Fireman Frank has 200 shoes. If he gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and gains 15 new pairs on Wednesday and 30 pairs on Friday, how many shoes will he have on Sunday if he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday?",
    "completion": "To determine how many shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes Frank has after Monday.\n2. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes Frank has after Wednesday.\n3. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes Frank has after Friday.\n4. Subtract the number of shoes Frank gets rid of on Saturday.\n5. Determine the number of pairs of shoes Frank has left on Sunday.\n6. Convert the number of pairs of shoes back to the number of shoes.\n\nLet's start with the initial number of shoes:\n- Frank starts with 200 shoes.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes after Monday.**\n- On Monday, Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes.\n- Total pairs on Monday: \\(5\\)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of pairs of shoes after Wednesday.**\n- On Wednesday, Frank gains 15 new pairs.\n- Total pairs on Wednesday: \\(5 + 15 = 20\\)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes after Friday.**\n- On Friday, Frank gains 30 new pairs.\n- Total pairs on Friday: \\(20 + 30 = 50\\)\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the number of shoes Frank gets rid of on Saturday.**\n- On Saturday, Frank gets rid of 180 shoes.\n- Total pairs on Saturday: \\(50 - 180 = -130\\)\n\nSince the number of pairs of shoes cannot be negative, it means Frank has 0 pairs of shoes left after Saturday. Therefore, he will have 0 pairs of shoes on Sunday.\n\n**Step 5: Convert the number of pairs of shoes back to the number of shoes.**\n- Since Frank has 0 pairs of shoes, he will have 0 shoes.\n\nThus, the number of shoes Frank will have on Sunday is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",
    "answer": "If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.\nWhen he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.\nSince a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.\nThe total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300\nOn Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120\n#### 120"
