    "question": "Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what's her annual salary?",
    "completion": "To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to consider her earnings from both her teaching and coaching roles.\n\nFirst, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:\n- She works 35 hours as a teacher per week.\n- She works 50 weeks a year.\n- She earns $20 per hour.\n\nEarnings from teaching = 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year\n\nNext, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:\n- She works 15 hours as a coach per week.\n- She works 50 weeks a year.\n- She earns $30 per hour.\n\nEarnings from coaching = 15 hours/week * $30/hour * 50 weeks/year\n\nNow, let's add her earnings from both roles to get her total annual salary:\nTotal annual salary = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from coaching\n\nLet's do the math:\n\nEarnings from teaching = 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year\nEarnings from teaching = $3500 * 50\nEarnings from teaching = $175,000\n\nEarnings from coaching = 15 hours/week * $30/hour * 50 weeks/year\nEarnings from coaching = $450 * 50\nEarnings from coaching = $22,500\n\nTotal annual salary = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from coaching\nTotal annual salary = $175,000 + $22,500\nTotal annual salary = $197,500\n\nTherefore, Jill's annual salary is $197,500.",
    "answer": "First find the total amount Jill makes per week teaching: $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $<<20*35=700>>700/week\nThen find the total amount Jill makes per week coaching: $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $<<30*15=450>>450/week\nThen add those two amounts to find the total amount Jill makes per week: $700/week + $450/week = $<<700+450=1150>>1150/week\nThen multiply that number by the number of weeks Jill works in a year to find her annual salary: $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $<<1150*50=57500>>57,500\n#### 57500"
