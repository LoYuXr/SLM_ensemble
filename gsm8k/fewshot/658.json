    "question": "Finley went to the grocery store and bought rice, beans, and pork for use in their home. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, while beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. If it took her 30 minutes to cook rice, how long in minutes did it take to cook all the food?",
    "completion": "To determine the total time Finley spent cooking all the food, we need to calculate the time spent on each item and then sum these times.\n\n1. **Time spent on rice:**\n   - It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.\n\n2. **Time spent on pork:**\n   - It took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.\n   - Therefore, the time spent on pork is:\n     \\[\n     30 \\text{ minutes} + 20 \\text{ minutes} = 50 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Time spent on beans:**\n   - It took Finley half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.\n   - First, calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:\n     \\[\n     30 \\text{ minutes} + 50 \\text{ minutes} = 80 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Then, divide this combined time by 2 to find the time spent on beans:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{80 \\text{ minutes}}{2} = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total time spent on all food:**\n   - Add the time spent on rice, pork, and beans:\n     \\[\n     30 \\text{ minutes} + 50 \\text{ minutes} + 40 \\text{ minutes} = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total time Finley spent cooking all the food is \\(\\boxed{120}\\) minutes.",
    "answer": "If rice took thirty minutes to cook, pork took 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.\nThe total cooking time for pork and rice is 50+30 = <<50+30=80>>80 minutes.\nThe beans cooked 1/2*80 = <<80*1/2=40>>40 minutes to cook.\nThe total amount of time taken to cook all the food is 40+50+30 = <<40+50+30=120>>120 minutes.\n#### 120"
