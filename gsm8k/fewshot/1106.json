    "question": "Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?",
    "completion": "To determine the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the length of each part after the first cut:**\n   Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon and cuts it into 4 equal parts. Therefore, each part after the first cut will be:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{100 \\text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the length of each part after the second cut:**\n   Now, we need to divide each of these 25 cm parts into 5 equal parts. Therefore, each of the final cuts will be:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{25 \\text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the length of each final cut will be \\(\\boxed{5}\\) centimeters.",
    "answer": "The 100-centimeter ribbon is cut into 4 equal parts in pieces of 100 / 4 = <<100/4=25>>25 cm\nFrom each piece of 25 cm, he gets 5 equal parts of 25 / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5 cm each.\n#### 5"
