    "question": "John likes to have a glass of water with breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Finally, he has one before he goes to bed as well.  John does this every weekday, but on the weekends he likes to relax and have a soda with dinner instead.  How many glasses of water does John drink in a week?",
    "completion": "To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his consumption over the weekdays and weekends separately, and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays:\n- John drinks one glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner each weekday.\n- There are 5 weekdays in a week.\n- Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\text{ glasses/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 25 \\text{ glasses}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends:\n- John drinks one glass of water with dinner on the weekend.\n- There are 2 weekend days in a week.\n- Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:\n  \\[\n  1 \\text{ glass/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 2 \\text{ glasses}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends:\n\\[\n25 \\text{ glasses} + 2 \\text{ glasses} = 27 \\text{ glasses}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{27}\n\\]",
    "answer": "John has 4 glasses of water a day on each of the 5 weekdays, for 4*5= <<4*5=20>>20 glasses.\nHe has 3 glasses of water on both weekend days, for 3*2= <<3*2=6>>6 glasses of water.\nHe has 20+6=<<20+6=26>>26 total glasses of water in a week.\n#### 26"
