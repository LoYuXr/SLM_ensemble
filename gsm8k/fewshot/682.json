    "question": "Shania is designing her own dress, and decides to make it a longer dress by extending the dress by 50% of its original length. She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. If the final design is 140cm long then how long, in centimeters, was the dress in its original design?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the original length of the dress as \\( L \\) centimeters.\n\nShania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length of the dress is:\n\\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \\]\n\nShe then adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. So the final length of the dress is:\n\\[ 1.5L + 20 \\]\n\nWe know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \\]\n\nTo find \\( L \\), we first isolate \\( L \\) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 1.5L = 120 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( L \\) by dividing both sides by 1.5:\n\\[ L = \\frac{120}{1.5} \\]\n\\[ L = 80 \\]\n\nSo, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.",
    "answer": "Without the lace trim, the dress is 140cm full length \u2013 20cm lace trim = <<140-20=120>>120cm.\nLet's assume the dress was originally x cm in length.\nHalf the original length is x/2.\nAdding the original length and the extended length, which is x+x/2 = 120\n3/2x = 120\nThe orginal length is x= 80 cm\n#### 80"
