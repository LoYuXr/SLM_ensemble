    "question": "Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer. If the computer cost $1,100, how much did one monitor cost, in dollars?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost of one monitor, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of the computer.\n2. Determine the cost of the printer.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer.\n4. Subtract the cost of the printer from the total cost to find the cost of the monitors.\n5. Divide the cost of the monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor.\n\nLet's start with the given information:\n- The cost of the computer is $1,100.\n- The cost of the printer is $400 less than the cost of the computer.\n- The total cost of the computer and the printer is $2,400.\n\nFirst, calculate the cost of the printer:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of the printer} = \\text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost of the computer and the printer} = 1100 + 700 = 1800 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, subtract the cost of the printer from the total cost to find the cost of the monitors:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of the monitors} = 2400 - 1800 = 600 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, divide the cost of the monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of one monitor} = \\frac{600}{2} = 300 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the cost of one monitor is \\(\\boxed{300}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "He paid 1100-400=<<1100-400=700>>700 for the printer.\nHe paid 2400-1100-700=<<2400-1100-700=600>>600 dollars for the monitors.\nEach monitor costs 600/2=<<600/2=300>>300 dollars.\n#### 300"
