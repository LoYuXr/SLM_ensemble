    "question": "Maggie spent a quarter of her money, while Riza spent one-third of her money. They each had $60. How much money do the two of them have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Maggie and Riza have left after spending their money, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Maggie's initial amount of money:**\n   Maggie spent a quarter of her money. Since she had $60 initially, we can find out how much she spent by calculating one quarter of $60.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Maggie's spending} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 60 = 15\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Maggie spent $15.\n\n2. **Calculate Riza's initial amount of money:**\n   Riza spent one-third of her money. Since she had $60 initially, we can find out how much she spent by calculating one third of $60.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Riza's spending} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Riza spent $20.\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of money spent by both:**\n   The total amount spent by both Maggie and Riza is the sum of what they spent individually.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total spent} = 15 + 20 = 35\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the amount of money left:**\n   To find out how much money is left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money left} = 60 - 35 = 25\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the two of them have \\(\\boxed{25}\\) dollars left.",
    "answer": "Maggie spent $60/4 = $<<60/4=15>>15.\nSo, Maggie is left with $60 - $15 = $<<60-15=45>>45.\nRiza spent $60/3 = $<<60/3=20>>20.\nSo, Riza is left with $60 - $20 = $<<60-20=40>>40.\nThus, they have a total of $45 + $40 = $<<45+40=85>>85 left.\n#### 85"
