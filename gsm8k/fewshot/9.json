    "question": "Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. If Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, how much are her earnings for this week?",
    "completion": "To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay and her overtime pay. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Calculate Eliza's regular pay for the first 40 hours:**\n   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.\n   - For the first 40 hours, her pay is:\n     \\[\n     40 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$10/\\text{hour} = \\$400\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Eliza's overtime pay for the remaining 5 hours:**\n   - Eliza's overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.\n   - For the remaining 5 hours, her pay is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ hours} \\times 1.2 \\times \\$10/\\text{hour} = 5 \\times 1.2 \\times \\$10 = \\$60\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week:**\n   - Her total earnings are the sum of her regular pay and her overtime pay:\n     \\[\n     \\$400 + \\$60 = \\$460\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are \\(\\boxed{460}\\).",
    "answer": "Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.\nHer hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.\nSo, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.\nHer regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.\nThus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.\n#### 460"
