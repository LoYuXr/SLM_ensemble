    "question": "Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. One third of the Pomeranians are girls. If there are 6 Pomeranian girls, how many puppies does Jana have?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of puppies Jana has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of Pomeranian puppies:**\n   - We know that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls.\n   - We are given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls.\n\n   Let \\( P \\) represent the total number of Pomeranian puppies. According to the problem:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} P = 6\n   \\]\n\n   To find \\( P \\), we solve for \\( P \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:\n   \\[\n   P = 6 \\times 3 = 18\n   \\]\n\n   So, there are 18 Pomeranian puppies in total.\n\n2. **Determine the number of Pomeranian puppies that are not girls:**\n   - We know that two thirds of the Pomeranian puppies are not girls.\n   - We are given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls.\n\n   Let \\( P_{\\text{not girls}} \\) represent the number of Pomeranian puppies that are not girls. According to the problem:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} P_{\\text{not girls}} = 6\n   \\]\n\n   To find \\( P_{\\text{not girls}} \\), we solve for \\( P_{\\text{not girls}} \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:\n   \\[\n   P_{\\text{not girls}} = 6 \\times 3 = 18\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, there are 18 Pomeranian puppies that are not girls.\n\n3. **Determine the total number of puppies:**\n   - The total number of puppies is the sum of the Pomeranian puppies and the Pomeranian puppies that are not girls.\n   - This can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of puppies} = P_{\\text{not girls}} + P_{\\text{Pomeranians}} = 18 + 18 = 36\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of puppies Jana has is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
    "answer": "Jana has 6*3=<<6*3=18>>18 Pomeranians.\nJana has 18/2*3=<<18/2*3=27>>27 puppies.\n#### 27"
