    "question": "If Mark weighs 150 pounds and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark.  And their friend Bob weighs twice as much as Susan.  What is the average weight of the 3 friends?",
    "completion": "To determine the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Susan's weight:**\n   - Mark weighs 150 pounds.\n   - Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Bob's weight:**\n   - Bob weighs twice as much as Susan.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bob's weight} = 2 \\times 130 = 260 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total weight of the three friends:**\n   - Add the weights of Mark, Susan, and Bob.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the average weight:**\n   - Divide the total weight by the number of friends (which is 3).\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average weight} = \\frac{540}{3} = 180 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the average weight of the three friends is \\(\\boxed{180}\\) pounds.",
    "answer": "Susan weighs 150 pounds - 20 pounds = <<150-20=130>>130 pounds.\nBob weighs 2 * 130 pounds = <<2*130=260>>260 pounds.\nThe friends total weight is 150 + 130 + 260 pounds = <<150+130+260=540>>540 pounds.\nThe friends' average weight is 540 pounds / 3 = <<540/3=180>>180 pounds.\n#### 180"
