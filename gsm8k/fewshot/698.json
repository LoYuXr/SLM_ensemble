    "question": "Greta\u2019s paycheck is $2400.00. She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account. She then uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment. After funding her retirement and paying for her car, how much money does she have left to spend?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of money Greta puts into her retirement account.\n2. Calculate the amount of money Greta uses to make her monthly car payment.\n3. Subtract the retirement account amount and the car payment amount from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of money Greta puts into her retirement account.\n   Greta's total paycheck is $2400.00, and she puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Retirement account amount} = 0.50 \\times 2400 = 1200\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the amount of money Greta uses to make her monthly car payment.\n   Greta uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Car payment amount} = 0.20 \\times 2400 = 480\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtract the retirement account amount and the car payment amount from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money left} = 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 640\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is \\(\\boxed{640}\\).",
    "answer": "Her paycheck is $2400.00 and she puts 50% into her retirement so that\u2019s 2400*.50 = $<<2400*.50=1200.00>>1200.00\nHer paycheck is $2400.00 and she puts $1200 into retirement so that leaves 2400-1200 = $<<2400-1200=1200.00>>1200.00\nHer car payment is 20% of 2400 so her car payment is .20*2400 = $<<20*.01*2400=480.00>>480.00\nShe had $1200 left and she uses $480.00 to make her car payment which leaves her with 1200-480 = $<<1200-480=720.00>>720.00 remaining for spending\n#### 720"
