    "question": "Mariah\u2019s grandma was teaching her to knit. Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. There are 364 yards in a skein of yarn. How many yards of yarn did they use altogether?",
    "completion": "To determine the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of yarn used by Mariah.\n2. Calculate the amount of yarn used by her grandma.\n3. Add the amounts of yarn used by both to find the total.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of yarn used by Mariah. Mariah used \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, we can find the amount used by Mariah by multiplying 364 by \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Yarn used by Mariah} = 364 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 91 \\text{ yards}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of yarn used by her grandma. Her grandma used \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of a skein of yarn. Using the same total of 364 yards, we can find the amount used by her grandma by multiplying 364 by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Yarn used by grandma} = 364 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 182 \\text{ yards}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the amounts of yarn used by both to find the total:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total yarn used} = 91 + 182 = 273 \\text{ yards}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma is \\(\\boxed{273}\\).",
    "answer": "Mariah\u2019s grandma used 1/2 a skein of yarn. We should multiply this by (2/2) to have a common denominator, so 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4.\nNow that there are common denominators, we can add the 1/4 skein of yarn Mariah used + 2/4 skein of yarn her grandma used = 3/4 of a skein of yarn.\n3/4 of a skein of yarn * 364 yards = 364 / 4 = <<3/4*364=273>>273 yards.\n#### 273"
