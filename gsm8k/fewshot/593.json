    "question": "Mark plants a beanstalk below his second-story window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk doubles its height every day. If the beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall, how many days will it take to be taller than Mark's window?",
    "completion": "To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate its height each day and see when it exceeds 20 feet.\n\n1. **Initial height**: The beanstalk starts at 4 feet.\n2. **Height after the first day**: The height doubles, so it becomes \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) feet.\n3. **Height after the second day**: The height doubles again, so it becomes \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\) feet.\n4. **Height after the third day**: The height doubles again, so it becomes \\(16 \\times 2 = 32\\) feet.\n5. **Height after the fourth day**: The height doubles again, so it becomes \\(32 \\times 2 = 64\\) feet.\n6. **Height after the fifth day**: The height doubles again, so it becomes \\(64 \\times 2 = 128\\) feet.\n7. **Height after the sixth day**: The height doubles again, so it becomes \\(128 \\times 2 = 256\\) feet.\n8. **Height after the seventh day**: The height doubles again, so it becomes \\(256 \\times 2 = 512\\) feet.\n9. **Height after the eighth day**: The height doubles again, so it becomes \\(512 \\times 2 = 1024\\) feet.\n10. **Height after the ninth day**: The height doubles again, so it becomes \\(1024 \\times 2 = 2048\\) feet.\n\nWe see that after the ninth day, the height of the beanstalk is 2048 feet, which is greater than 20 feet. Therefore, it will take 9 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
    "answer": "To find the beanstalk's height after one day, multiply the starting height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet\nTo find its height after two days, multiply the height after one day by 2: 8 feet * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 feet\nTo find its height after three days, multiply the height after two days by 2: 16 feet * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 feet. This is taller than the window, so it took three days for the beanstalk to pass the window.\n#### 3"
