    "question": "A pencil cost $0.50, and an eraser cost $0.25. If you bought 6 pencils and 8 erasers and paid $10, how much change would you get?",
    "completion": "To determine the change you would get, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the pencils.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the erasers.\n3. Add the total costs of the pencils and erasers to find the total amount spent.\n4. Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount paid to find the change.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The cost of one pencil is $0.50. If you bought 6 pencils, the total cost of the pencils is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 0.50 = 3.00\n   \\]\n\n2. The cost of one eraser is $0.25. If you bought 8 erasers, the total cost of the erasers is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 0.25 = 2.00\n   \\]\n\n3. The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the pencils and the cost of the erasers:\n   \\[\n   3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00\n   \\]\n\n4. The initial amount paid is $10.00. To find the change, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount paid:\n   \\[\n   10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the change you would get is \\(\\boxed{5.00}\\).",
    "answer": "6 pencils cost 6 x $0.50 = $<<6*0.5=3>>3.\n8 erasers cost 8 x $0.25 = $<<8*0.25=2>>2.\nThus, you spent $3 + $2 = $<<3+2=5>>5.\nTherefore, you would get $10 - $5 = $<<10-5=5>>5 change.\n#### 5"
