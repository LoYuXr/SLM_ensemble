    "question": "There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. If both aquariums have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are there in each aquarium?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \\( F \\).\n\nFirst, we know that there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is given as twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation for the difference as:\n\\[ 32 - 4 = 2F \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 28 = 2F \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( F \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ F = \\frac{28}{2} = 14 \\]\n\nSo, the number of fish in each aquarium is \\( 14 \\).\n\nTo verify, we can check the total number of snails and fish in both aquariums:\n- Total number of snails: \\( 4 + 32 = 36 \\)\n- Total number of fish: \\( 14 + 14 = 28 \\)\n\nThe difference between the number of snails and fish is:\n\\[ 36 - 28 = 8 \\]\n\nSince the difference is twice the number of fish, and we have 14 fish, the difference is indeed twice 14, confirming our solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
    "answer": "The difference between the number of snails is 32 - 4 = <<32-4=28>>28 snails.\nThere are 28/2 = <<28/2=14>>14 fish in both aquariums.\nThere are 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 fish in each aquarium.\n#### 7"
