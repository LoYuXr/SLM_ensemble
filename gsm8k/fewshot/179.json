    "question": "Lloyd earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring.  He tutored 5 hours for the first week and 8 hours for the second week. How much did he earn for the first two weeks?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the earnings for the first week:\n- Lloyd earns $10 per hour.\n- He tutored for 5 hours in the first week.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings for the first week} = 5 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$10/\\text{hour} = \\$50\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the earnings for the second week:\n- Lloyd also tutored for 8 hours in the second week.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings for the second week} = 8 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$10/\\text{hour} = \\$80\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the earnings from both weeks to find the total earnings for the first two weeks:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings} = \\$50 + \\$80 = \\$130\n\\]\n\nThus, Lloyd earned a total of \\(\\boxed{130}\\) dollars for the first two weeks of tutoring.",
    "answer": "Lloyd tutored 5 + 8 = <<5+8=13>>13 hours for the first two weeks.\nTherefore, he earned 13 x $10 = $<<13*10=130>>130 for the first two weeks.\n#### 130"
