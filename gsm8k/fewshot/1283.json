    "question": "Frances sells 20 cupcakes for $2 for each cupcake and  40  cookies at $1 each.  She buys five trays at $4 for each tray. How much money does Frances have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Frances has left after selling and buying items, we need to calculate her total earnings and then subtract her expenses.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cupcakes:\n- Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each.\n\\[\n20 \\text{ cupcakes} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per cupcake} = \\$40\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cookies:\n- Frances sells 40 cookies at $1 each.\n\\[\n40 \\text{ cookies} \\times \\$1 \\text{ per cookie} = \\$40\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cupcakes and cookies:\n\\[\n\\$40 \\text{ (cupcakes)} + \\$40 \\text{ (cookies)} = \\$80\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the trays:\n- Frances buys 5 trays at $4 each.\n\\[\n5 \\text{ trays} \\times \\$4 \\text{ per tray} = \\$20\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total expenses:\n\\[\n\\$80 \\text{ (revenue)} - \\$20 \\text{ (trays)} = \\$60\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the amount of money Frances has left:\n\\[\n\\$80 \\text{ (revenue)} - \\$60 \\text{ (expenses)} = \\$20\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Frances has left is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
    "answer": "20 cupcakes cost 20 x $2 =$<<20*2=40>>40.\n40 cookies cost 40 x $1 = $<<40*1=40>>40.\nSo, Frances earns $40 + $40 = $<<40+40=80>>80 for selling cupcakes and cookies.\nThe cost of five trays is 5 x $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.\nTherefore, France will have $80 - $20 = $<<80-20=60>>60 left.\n#### 60"
