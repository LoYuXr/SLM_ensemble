    "question": "Jack decides to visit a museum 150 miles from home.  He drives 75 mph there and back.  He spends 6 hours at the museum.  How long is he gone from home?",
    "completion": "To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time he spends driving and at the museum, and then add that to the time he spends at the museum.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n\\]\n\nSo, the time spent driving is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time driving} = \\frac{150 \\text{ miles}}{75 \\text{ mph}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time spent at the museum is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time at the museum} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the time spent driving and at the museum to find the total time Jack is gone from home:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\text{Time driving} + \\text{Time at the museum} = 2 \\text{ hours} + 6 \\text{ hours} = 8 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time Jack is gone from home is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",
    "answer": "He drove a total of 150+150=<<150+150=300>>300 miles\nSo he drove for 300/75=<<300/75=4>>4 hours\nThat means he was gone from home for 4+6=<<4+6=10>>10 hours\n#### 10"
