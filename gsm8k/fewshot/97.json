    "question": "When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes that she uses contains three tomatoes. Freda\u2019s last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda use?",
    "completion": "To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes in the 32 ounces of sauce:**\n   Each can of tomato sauce contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes in 32 ounces is:\n   \\[\n   32 \\text{ ounces} \\times 3 \\text{ tomatoes/ounce} = 96 \\text{ tomatoes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the volume of the sauce:**\n   The problem states that the last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. This matches our calculation from step 1.\n\n3. **Calculate the volume of the sauce in terms of the number of cans:**\n   Since each can contains 16 ounces of sauce, the total volume of the sauce in terms of cans is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{32 \\text{ ounces}}{16 \\text{ ounces/can}} = 2 \\text{ cans}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can:**\n   Each can contains 3 tomatoes.\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used:**\n   Since there are 2 cans and each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ cans} \\times 3 \\text{ tomatoes/can} = 6 \\text{ tomatoes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Freda used \\(\\boxed{6}\\) tomatoes.",
    "answer": "Tomatoes lose half their volume when made into sauce, so Freda started with 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 ounces of tomatoes.\nAt 16 ounces per can, she used 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 cans of tomatoes.\nAt 3 tomatoes a can, Freda used 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 tomatoes.\n#### 12"
