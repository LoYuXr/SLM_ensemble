    "question": "A tomato vendor decides to switch who he buys his tomatoes for.  He sells 500 tomatoes a day.  He used to buy them for $.5 each but he gets a new vendor who sells them for $.4 each.  How much money does he save a week?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total revenue from selling tomatoes.\n2. Calculate the total cost of buying tomatoes.\n3. Determine the savings by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling tomatoes.**\n\nThe vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day at $0.4 each.\n\\[\n\\text{Total revenue per day} = 500 \\times 0.4 = 200 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of buying tomatoes.**\n\nThe vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.5 each, but he now buys them for $0.4 each.\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost per day} = 500 \\times 0.4 = 200 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the savings by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Savings per day} = 200 - 200 = 0 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSince the vendor sells tomatoes every day, the savings per week (7 days) is:\n\\[\n\\text{Savings per week} = 0 \\times 7 = 0 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the vendor saves \\(\\boxed{0}\\) dollars a week.",
    "answer": "He buys 500*7=<<500*7=3500>>3500\nHe used to pay 3500*.5=$<<3500*.5=1750>>1750\nHe now pays 3500*.4=$<<3500*.4=1400>>1400\nSo he saves 1750-1400=$<<1750-1400=350>>350\n#### 350"
