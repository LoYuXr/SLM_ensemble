    "question": "Belen has two kinds of pennies, a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, what is the combined weight of the two pennies?",
    "completion": "To determine the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the weight of the 1959 penny:**\n   The problem states that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.\n\n2. **Determine the weight of the 2010 penny:**\n   The problem also states that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Therefore, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight of the 2010 penny} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\text{Weight of the 1959 penny} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 48 \\text{ grains}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the right-hand side:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight of the 2010 penny} = \\frac{3 \\times 48}{4} = \\frac{144}{4} = 36 \\text{ grains}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the combined weight of the two pennies:**\n   The combined weight of the two pennies is the sum of the weight of the 2010 penny and the weight of the 1959 penny:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Combined weight} = \\text{Weight of the 2010 penny} + \\text{Weight of the 1959 penny} = 36 \\text{ grains} + 48 \\text{ grains} = 84 \\text{ grains}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the combined weight of the two pennies is \\(\\boxed{84}\\) grains.",
    "answer": "If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, the 2010 penny weighs 3/4 * 48 grains = <<48*3/4=36>>36 grains\nThe combined weight for the two is 36 grains + 48 grains = <<36+48=84>>84 grains\n#### 84"
