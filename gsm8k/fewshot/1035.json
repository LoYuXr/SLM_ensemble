    "question": "Richard wants to make a video to share online of him doing a science experiment that creates a fountain of diet soda after placing a specific branded candy inside it. Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet of the driveway. After starting at the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. How many seconds total will it take Richard to set off all the soda fountains?",
    "completion": "To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard needs:**\n   - Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide.\n   - He places a bottle of soda every 3 feet.\n   - Therefore, the number of bottles is \\( \\frac{24}{3} = 8 \\).\n\n2. **Determine the time to go from one bottle to the next:**\n   - It takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next.\n\n3. **Calculate the total time for all bottles:**\n   - Since there are 8 bottles, the total time is \\( 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\) seconds.\n\nThus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \\(\\boxed{40}\\) seconds.",
    "answer": "If Richard's driveway is 24 feet long and he puts a bottle of soda every 3 feet, then out of 24 feet total there are 24 / 3 feet between each bottle = <<24/3=8>>8 bottles.\nIf Richard starts at 0 seconds with the first bottle and it takes him 5 seconds to go onto the next bottle to drop the candy, then it will take him 5 seconds x 7 bottles = 35 seconds total.\n#### 35"
