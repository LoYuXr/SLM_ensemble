    "question": "Ariadne has a shop selling hats of two different colors, red and green. Her sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Calculate the total amount she made in two months if in the second month her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( R \\) be the total amount Ariadne made in the first month.\n   - Let \\( G \\) be the total amount Ariadne made in the second month.\n\n2. **Calculate the Sales from Red Hats:**\n   - In the first month, Ariadne sold \\( R \\) red hats.\n   - In the second month, she sold \\( \\frac{1}{2}R \\) red hats.\n   - The sales from red hats in the second month is \\( \\frac{1}{2}R \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Sales from Green Hats:**\n   - In the first month, Ariadne sold \\( G \\) green hats.\n   - In the second month, she sold \\( \\frac{3}{4}G \\) green hats.\n   - The sales from green hats in the second month is \\( \\frac{3}{4}G \\).\n\n4. **Set Up the Equation for Total Sales:**\n   - The total sales from both months is the sum of the sales from red hats and green hats.\n   - Therefore, we have:\n     \\[\n     R + \\frac{1}{2}R + \\frac{3}{4}G = R + \\frac{1}{2}R + \\frac{3}{4}G\n     \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the Equation:**\n   - Combine the terms involving \\( R \\):\n     \\[\n     R + \\frac{1}{2}R + \\frac{3}{4}G = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)R + \\frac{3}{4}G = \\frac{3}{2}R + \\frac{3}{4}G\n     \\]\n   - The equation simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3}{2}R + \\frac{3}{4}G = R + \\frac{1}{2}R + \\frac{3}{4}G\n     \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\( G \\):**\n   - Subtract \\( \\frac{1}{2}R + \\frac{3}{4}G \\) from both sides:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3}{2}R + \\frac{3}{4}G - \\left(\\frac{1",
    "answer": "Since the total sales of red hats were half that of green hats in the first month, she made 2*$400=$<<2*400=800>>800 from green hats.\nHer total sales in the first month are $800+$400=$<<800+400=1200>>1200.\nIn the second month, she made 3/4*1200=$<<3/4*1200=900>>900.\nThe total amount of money Ariadne made from two months of sales is $1200+$900=$<<1200+900=2100>>2100.\n#### 2100"
