    "question": "Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles.  But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%.  If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?",
    "completion": "To determine how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after his diet improvement, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Lee's original time:**\n   Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. If Lee runs in 38 seconds, then Gerald's original time is:\n   \\[\n   38 \\text{ seconds} + 2 \\text{ seconds} = 40 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Lee's new time with the improved diet:**\n   The diet improvement increases Lee's speed by 10%. Therefore, Lee's new time is:\n   \\[\n   38 \\text{ seconds} \\times 1.10 = 41.8 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine Gerald's new time with the improved diet:**\n   Since Lee's new time is 41.8 seconds, and Lee's original time was 40 seconds, Gerald's new time is:\n   \\[\n   41.8 \\text{ seconds} - 40 \\text{ seconds} = 1.8 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in \\boxed{1.8} seconds with his improved diet.",
    "answer": "If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles, then Gerald initially would run the 400-meter hurdles in 38+2=<<38+2=40>>40 seconds.\n10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.\nThe improved diet reduced Gerald's race time to 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 seconds.\n#### 36"
