    "question": "Bud makes homemade macaroni and cheese once a week.  The pasta costs $1.00 a box, and he spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount for the gruyere cheese.  How much money does Bud spend on making macaroni and cheese in one year?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the pasta.\n2. Calculate the cost of the cheddar cheese.\n3. Calculate the cost of the gruyere cheese.\n4. Sum up the costs of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese to get the total annual cost.\n\nLet's start with the cost of the pasta:\nThe cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box.\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the cheddar cheese:\nThe cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00.\n\nThen, we calculate the cost of the gruyere cheese:\nThe cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 \\times 2 = $6.00.\n\nNow, we sum up the costs of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese to get the total annual cost:\nTotal annual cost = Cost of pasta + Cost of cheddar cheese + Cost of gruyere cheese\nTotal annual cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00\nTotal annual cost = $10.00\n\nTherefore, Bud spends \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars on making macaroni and cheese in one year.",
    "answer": "The gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the $3.00 cheddar cheese so it costs 2*3 = $<<2*3=6.00>>6.00\nThe pasta costs $1.00, the cheddar cheese costs $3.00 and the gruyere cheese is $6.00 for a total of 1+3+6 = $<<1+3+6=10.00>>10.00\nThere are 52 weeks in a year and he makes this dish once a week so it will cost him 52*10 = $<<52*10=520.00>>520.00 in one year\n#### 520"
