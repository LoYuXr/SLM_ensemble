    "question": "Jo has been making face masks. She can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material and 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. How much material would she need to make 20 small and 8 large masks for her class?",
    "completion": "To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:\n- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.\n- Therefore, the material needed for one small mask is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2 \\text{ yards}}{4 \\text{ masks}} = 0.5 \\text{ yards per mask}\n  \\]\n- For 20 small masks, the total material needed is:\n  \\[\n  20 \\text{ masks} \\times 0.5 \\text{ yards per mask} = 10 \\text{ yards}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:\n- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.\n- Therefore, the material needed for one large mask is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2.25 \\text{ yards}}{3 \\text{ masks}} = 0.75 \\text{ yards per mask}\n  \\]\n- For 8 large masks, the total material needed is:\n  \\[\n  8 \\text{ masks} \\times 0.75 \\text{ yards per mask} = 6 \\text{ yards}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the material needed for both types of masks:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ yards} + 6 \\text{ yards} = 16 \\text{ yards}\n\\]\n\nThus, Jo would need a total of \\boxed{16} yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.",
    "answer": "It takes 2 yards of material / 4 small masks = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 yards of material per mask.\nIt takes 2.25 yards of material / 3 large masks = <<2.25/3=0.75>>0.75 yards of material per mask.\nFor the small masks, it will take 20 masks x 0.5 yards = <<20*0.5=10>>10 yards of material.\nFor the large masks, it will take 8 masks x 0.75 yards = <<8*0.75=6>>6 yards of material.\nIn all, it will take 10 yards + 6 yards = <<10+6=16>>16 yards of material.\n#### 16"
