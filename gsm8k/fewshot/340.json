    "question": "Josh decides to take up juggling to perform at the school talent show a month in the future.  He starts off practicing juggling 3 balls, and slowly gets better adding 1 ball to his juggling act each week.  After the end of the fourth week the talent show begins, but when Josh walks on stage he slips and drops three of his balls.  2 of them are caught by people in the crowd as they roll off the stage, but one gets lost completely since the auditorium is dark.  With a sigh, Josh starts to juggle on stage with how many balls?",
    "completion": "To determine how many balls Josh has after the talent show, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of balls he juggling each week.\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Josh starts with 3 balls.\n\n2. **Week 1:**\n   - Josh juggling 3 balls.\n   - Total balls: 3\n\n3. **Week 2:**\n   - Josh juggling 4 balls.\n   - Total balls: 3 + 4 = 7\n\n4. **Week 3:**\n   - Josh juggling 5 balls.\n   - Total balls: 7 + 5 = 12\n\n5. **Week 4:**\n   - Josh juggling 6 balls.\n   - Total balls: 12 + 6 = 18\n\n6. **After the Talent Show:**\n   - Josh slips and drops 3 of his balls.\n   - Total balls: 18 - 3 = 15\n\nTherefore, after the talent show, Josh has 15 balls juggling on stage.",
    "answer": "Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks for a total of 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7\nJosh drops 3 balls when he trips on stage leaving him with 7-3= <<7-3=4>>4 balls\n#### 4"
