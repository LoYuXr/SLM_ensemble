    "question": "Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. They have a total of 70 legs, all together. How many of the animals are chickens?",
    "completion": "To determine how many of the animals on Farmer Brown's farm are chickens, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( c \\) as the number of chickens.\n- \\( k \\) as the number of cows.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1. The total number of animals is 20.\n2. The total number of legs is 70.\n\nSince each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs, we can write the following equations:\n1. \\( c + k = 20 \\)\n2. \\( 2c + 4k = 70 \\)\n\nWe can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 2:\n\\[ c + 2k = 35 \\]\n\nNow we have a system of linear equations:\n1. \\( c + k = 20 \\)\n2. \\( c + 2k = 35 \\)\n\nTo eliminate \\( c \\), we can subtract the first equation from the second:\n\\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \\]\n\\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \\]\n\\[ k = 15 \\]\n\nSo, there are 15 cows on the farm. Now we substitute \\( k = 15 \\) back into the first equation to find \\( c \\):\n\\[ c + 15 = 20 \\]\n\\[ c = 20 - 15 \\]\n\\[ c = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of chickens on the farm is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
    "answer": "Let C be the number of chickens.\nThere are 20-C cows.\nThe cows have 4*(20-C) legs.\nThe cows have 2C legs.\nThe total number of legs is 2C+4(20-C)=70.\n2C+80-4C=70\n2C=10\nC=<<5=5>>5\n#### 5"
