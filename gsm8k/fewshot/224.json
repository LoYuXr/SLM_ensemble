    "question": "Carlos and Benji are at the beach. Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour. If Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and Benji uses the raft for 5 hours, how much will they pay for their rentals, altogether?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost for Carlos and Benji's rentals, we need to calculate the cost for each of their activities separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost for Carlos's rental:\n- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour.\n- Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours.\n- Therefore, the cost for Carlos's rental is:\n  \\[\n  30 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost for Benji's rental:\n- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 per hour.\n- Benji uses the raft for 5 hours.\n- Therefore, the cost for Benji's rental is:\n  \\[\n  18 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 5 \\text{ hours} = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the costs for both Carlos and Benji to find the total cost:\n\\[\n90 \\text{ dollars} + 90 \\text{ dollars} = 180 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{180}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Carlos would have to pay $30 x 3 = $<<30*3=90>>90\nBenji would have to pay $18 x 5 = $<<18*5=90>>90\nAll together, Carlos and Benji will have to pay $90 + $90 = $<<90+90=180>>180\n#### 180"
