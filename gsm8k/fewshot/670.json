    "question": "Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy after Halloween. If they decide to pool and share their candy equally with each other, how much candy would each of them have?",
    "completion": "To determine how much candy each person would have if they pool and share it equally, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of candy they have together.\n2. Divide the total amount of candy by the number of people (which is 3).\n\nFirst, let's find the total amount of candy:\n- Robert has 3 pounds of candy.\n- Cindy has 5 pounds of candy.\n- Aaron has 4 pounds of candy.\n\nAdding these amounts together:\n\\[ 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we need to divide the total amount of candy by 3 to find out how much each person would have:\n\\[ \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSo, each person would have \\(\\boxed{4}\\) pounds of candy.",
    "answer": "Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy which equals 3 + 5 + 4 = <<3+5+4=12>>12 pounds of candy\nSince there are three of them (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron), they divide the candy into 3 equal portions. 12/3 = <<12/3=4>>4 pounds of candy\n#### 4"
