    "question": "Rozanne is making eggnog for her family. She uses 4 dozen eggs that were in cases and another 2 eggs that were loose in the cupboard. She puts out trays that each hold 5 glasses of eggnog. If each glass needs 5 eggs, how many trays can Rozanne put out?",
    "completion": "To determine how many trays Rozanne can put out, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has.\n2. Determine how many glasses of eggnog can be made from the total number of eggs.\n3. Calculate how many trays are needed to hold the number of glasses of eggnog.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:\n- She uses 4 dozen eggs in cases.\n- She uses 2 eggs that are loose in the cupboard.\n\nSince 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs are:\n\\[ 4 \\times 12 = 48 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nAdding the 2 loose eggs:\n\\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog can be made from 50 eggs. Each glass needs 5 eggs:\n\\[ \\frac{50}{5} = 10 \\text{ glasses} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many trays are needed to hold 10 glasses of eggnog. Each tray holds 5 glasses:\n\\[ \\frac{10}{5} = 2 \\text{ trays} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",
    "answer": "As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.\nShe therefore has a total of 48 eggs in cases + 2 loose eggs = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs.\nSo she can make 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass of eggnog = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.\nThis means she can put out 10 glasses of eggnog / 5 glasses per tray = <<10/5=2>>2 trays.\n#### 2"
