    "question": "A company decided to take its employees on a tour to explore an ancient site. The employees were divided into 3 groups of 200 employees. Each group was assigned 7 tour guides. How many is the total number of people going on this tour?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tour guides assigned to the groups.\n2. Determine the total number of people in each group.\n3. Calculate the total number of people going on the tour by multiplying the number of groups by the total number of people in each group.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of tour guides assigned to the groups:**\n   Each group is assigned 7 tour guides, and there are 3 groups.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of tour guides} = 7 \\times 3 = 21\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of people in each group:**\n   Each group consists of 200 employees, and there are 3 groups.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of people in each group} = 200 \\times 3 = 600\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of people going on the tour:**\n   There are 3 groups, and each group has 600 people.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of people going on the tour} = 3 \\times 600 = 1800\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of people going on the tour is \\(\\boxed{1800}\\).",
    "answer": "The number of employees is 3 groups * 200 employees/group = <<3*200=600>>600 employees.\nThe number of tour guides is 3 groups * 7 guides/group = <<3*7=21>>21 guides.\nThe total number of people going on this tour is 600 employees + 21 guides = <<600+21=621>>621 people.\n#### 621"
