    "question": "Lana is brewing cups of tea for her friends. She has 27 cups, and she divides these into 3 rows. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. She then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. How many cups of mint tea are in each row?",
    "completion": "To determine how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cups used for cinnamon tea:**\n   Lana uses a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea.\n\n2. **Determine the number of cups used for chamomile tea:**\n   Since the total number of cups used for cinnamon tea is 15, and she has 27 cups in total, the number of cups used for chamomile tea is:\n   \\[\n   27 - 15 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of cups used for mint tea:**\n   Since the total number of cups used for cinnamon tea is 15 and the number of cups used for chamomile tea is 12, the number of cups used for mint tea is:\n   \\[\n   15 - 12 = 3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of cups in each row:**\n   Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows. To find out how many cups are in each row, we divide the total number of cups by the number of rows:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{27}{3} = 9\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
    "answer": "If there are 15 cups of cinnamon tea, then there are a total of 27 \u2013 15 = <<27-15=12>>12 cups of chamomile or mint tea.\nAs there are equal amounts of chamomile tea and mint tea, there is a total of 12 cups / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cups of mint tea.\nDividing these into rows shows that each row holds 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 cups of mint tea.\n#### 2"
