    "question": "Kira bought 3 apples, 5 bananas and 6 oranges at the grocery store. Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit. How many pieces are left?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pieces of fruit are left after Lola ate some, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pieces of fruit Kira initially bought.\n2. Subtract the number of pieces of fruit Lola ate from the total number of pieces of fruit Kira initially bought.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of pieces of fruit Kira initially bought:\n- Kira bought 3 apples.\n- Kira bought 5 bananas.\n- Kira bought 6 oranges.\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\\[ 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 \\]\nSo, Kira initially bought 14 pieces of fruit.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of pieces of fruit Lola ate from the total number of pieces of fruit Kira initially bought:\n- Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit.\n\nSubtracting 2 from 14 gives:\n\\[ 14 - 2 = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of fruit left is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
    "answer": "Kira bought 3 + 5 + 6 = <<3+5+6=14>>14 pieces of fruit.\nAfter Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit there are 14 - 2 = <<14-2=12>>12 pieces of fruit.\n#### 12"
