    "question": "Conor lives near a beach and loves going there every day to have fun. On a particular week, he found 50 people at the beach on the first day. The next day, 20 more people were present at the beach than on the first day, and on the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day. If Conor saw an average of 60 people each day the rest of the week, calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week.",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of people Conor saw at the beach over the week, we need to calculate the number of people at the beach each day and then sum them up.\n\n1. **First Day:**\n   - Number of people: 50\n\n2. **Second Day:**\n   - Number of people: 50 + 20 = 70\n\n3. **Third Day:**\n   - Number of people: 2 * 70 = 140\n\n4. **Fourth Day:**\n   - Number of people: 2 * 140 = 280\n\n5. **Fifth Day:**\n   - Number of people: 2 * 280 = 560\n\nNow, we sum the number of people from all five days:\n\n\\[\n50 + 70 + 140 + 280 + 560\n\\]\n\nLet's add these step by step:\n\n\\[\n50 + 70 = 120\n\\]\n\\[\n120 + 140 = 260\n\\]\n\\[\n260 + 280 = 540\n\\]\n\\[\n540 + 560 = 1100\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is \\(\\boxed{1100}\\).",
    "answer": "There were 50 people at the beach on the first day. On the second day, the number of people at the beach increased to 50 people + 20 people = <<50+20=70>>70 people\nThe third day, the total number of people at the beach was twice the number on the second day: thus, 2 * 70 people = <<70*2=140>>140 people\nFor the remaining days of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people per day, for a total of 60 people/day * 4 days = <<60*4=240>>240 people\nConor saw a total of 240 people + 140 people + 70 people + 50 people = <<240+140+70+50=500>>500 people\n#### 500"
