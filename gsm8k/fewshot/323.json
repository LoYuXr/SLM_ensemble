    "question": "Shannon makes herself iced coffee by brewing hot coffee and adding ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees but makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Any added liquid also weakens the coffee. How many milliliters weaker is Shannon\u2019s iced coffee when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream?",
    "completion": "To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the effect of the iced coffee cooling by 65 degrees:**\n   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.\n   - The coffee is 12 milliliters weaker when cooled by 65 degrees.\n   - Therefore, the total effect of the cooling is \\(13 \\text{ degrees} \\times 65 = 845 \\text{ degrees}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream:**\n   - Each added milliliter of cream weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters.\n   - The total effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream is \\(15 \\text{ milliliters} \\times 12 = 180 \\text{ milliliters}\\).\n\n3. **Determine the net effect of the cooling and cream:**\n   - The net effect is the total effect of the cooling minus the total effect of the cream.\n   - Net effect = \\(845 \\text{ degrees} - 180 \\text{ milliliters} = 665 \\text{ degrees}\\).\n\n4. **Convert the net effect back to milliliters:**\n   - Since 1 degree is equal to 1000 milliliters, the net effect in milliliters is \\(665 \\text{ degrees} \\times 1000 = 665000 \\text{ milliliters}\\).\n\nTherefore, Shannon's iced coffee is \\(\\boxed{665000}\\) milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream.",
    "answer": "Shannon\u2019s iced coffee has 65 / 13 = <<65/13=5>>5 ice cubes in it.\nThe ice makes the coffee 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 milliliters weaker.\nAfter adding cream, Shannon\u2019s iced coffee is 60 + 15 = <<60+15=75>>75 milliliters weaker.\n#### 75"
