Add the number of roses and dahlias together to find the total number of flowers.\n\nStep 1: Identify the number of roses.\nThe problem states that there are 4 roses in the vase.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of dahlias.\nThe problem also states that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Therefore, we add 7 to the number of roses:\n\\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \\]\nSo, there are 11 dahlias in the vase.\n\nStep 3: Add the number of roses and dahlias together.\n\\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \\]\nSo, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]",
    "answer": "There are 4 + 7 = <<4+7=11>>11 dahlias in the vase.\nIn total there are 4 + 11 = <<4+11=15>>15 flowers in the vase.\n#### 15"
