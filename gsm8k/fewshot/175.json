    "question": "Juan and his brother Carlos are selling lemonade. For each gallon they make it costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. If they made $25 in profit, how much did they spend on lemons?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Juan and his brother spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade:**\n   - They sell each glass for $0.50.\n   - They sell 20 glasses per gallon.\n   - They make a profit of $25.\n   - Therefore, the total revenue is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Revenue} = \\text{Profit} + \\text{Cost of lemons} + \\text{Cost of sugar}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Revenue} = 25 + 3 + 2 = 30\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of glasses sold:**\n   - They sell each glass for $0.50.\n   - They sell 20 glasses per gallon.\n   - Therefore, the total number of glasses sold is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Number of Glasses} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Price per Glass}}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Number of Glasses} = \\frac{30}{0.50} = 60\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of gallons sold:**\n   - They sell each gallon for $3.\n   - Therefore, the number of gallons sold is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of Gallons} = \\frac{\\text{Total Number of Glasses}}{\\text{Price per Gallon}}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of Gallons} = \\frac{60}{3} = 20\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the cost of lemons:**\n   - They get 20 glasses per gallon.\n   - They sell each glass for $0.50.\n   - Therefore, the total cost of lemons is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of Lemons} = \\text{Number of Gallons} \\times \\text{Price per Glass}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of Lemons} = 20 \\times 0.50 = 10\n     \\]\n\nThus, the amount spent on lemons is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
    "answer": "Each gallon sells for a total of $10 because 20 x .5 = <<20*.5=10>>10\nEach gallon costs $5 to make because 3 + 2 = <<5=5>>5\nThey make $5 off each gallon because 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5\nThey made and sold 5 gallons because 25 / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5\nThey spent $15 on lemons because 5 x 3 = <<5*3=15>>15\n#### 15"
