    "question": "Dale is selling butterscotch candies to raise money for his club at school. He doesn't have the candies yet and is instead just taking orders. He started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. Then he ordered 100 more. How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?",
    "completion": "To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of candies Dale has after his initial orders:**\n   - Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies.\n   - He ordered 100 more butterscotch candies.\n   - Therefore, the total number of candies Dale has is:\n     \\[\n     100 + 100 = 200\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many candies Dale still needs to sell:**\n   - Dale sold a total of 150 butterscotch candies.\n   - Dale has 200 candies in total.\n   - Therefore, the number of candies Dale still needs to sell is:\n     \\[\n     200 - 150 = 50\n     \\]\n\nSo, Dale still needs to sell \\boxed{50} butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.",
    "answer": "Dale starts off selling 100 butterscotch candies that he ordered, but ends up selling 150, 100 - 150 = <<100-150=-50>>-50 candies.\nSo Dale orders 100 more candies to make up for the deficit and to sell even more, -50 candies + 100 candies = <<100-50=50>>50 candies Dale has left and still needs to sell.\n#### 50"
