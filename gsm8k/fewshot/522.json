    "question": "It's strawberry-picking time on Grandma Concetta's farm.  Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour, while Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony.  Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, and Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy.  In total, how many quarts of strawberries can Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries picked by Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm, we need to calculate the hourly rates for each person and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Tony's Rate:**\n   Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.\n\n2. **Bobby's Rate:**\n   Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony. Therefore, Bobby's rate is:\n   \\[\n   6 - 1 = 5 \\text{ quarts per hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Kathy's Rate:**\n   Kathy picks twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby. Therefore, Kathy's rate is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ quarts per hour}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Ricky's Rate:**\n   Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy. Therefore, Ricky's rate is:\n   \\[\n   10 - 2 = 8 \\text{ quarts per hour}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum up the rates of all four individuals to find the total number of quarts picked per hour:\n\\[\n6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 \\text{ quarts per hour}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of quarts of strawberries picked per hour by Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy is \\(\\boxed{29}\\).",
    "answer": "Bobby picks one fewer quart of strawberries per hour than the 6 quarts of berries per hour that Tony can pick, for a total of 6-1=<<6-1=5>>5 quarts per hour.\nKathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, for a total of 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 quarts per hour.\nRicky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, or a total of 10-2=8 quarts per hour. Thus, in total, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick 6+5+10+8=<<6+5+10+8=29>>29 quarts of strawberries per hour.\n#### 29"
