    "question": "Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly\u2019s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples she has, and then subtract this total from her budget of $65.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the bacon:\n- Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.\n- Each pack of bacon costs $10.\n- Therefore, the total cost of the bacon is \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the chicken:\n- Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.\n- Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, which is \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) dollars.\n- Therefore, the total cost of the chicken is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) dollars.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the strawberries:\n- Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.\n- Each pack of strawberries costs $4.\n- Therefore, the total cost of the strawberries is \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the apples:\n- Kelly has 7 packs of apples.\n- Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is \\(4 / 2 = 2\\) dollars.\n- Therefore, the total cost of the apples is \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\) dollars.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:\n- The total cost of the bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples is \\(50 + 120 + 12 + 14 = 186\\) dollars.\n\nFinally, let's subtract this total cost from Kelly's budget to find out how much money she has left:\n- Kelly's budget is $65.\n- The amount of money left is \\(65 - 186 = -121\\).\n\nSince the result is negative, it means Kelly has $121 less than her budget. Therefore, she does not have enough money to cover all the items she has. She would need an additional $121 to cover the cost of the bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples.",
    "answer": "Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.\nSo each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.\nAll of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.\nThe strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.\nEach pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.\nSo all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.\nIn total, Kelly\u2019s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.\nShe therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.\n#### 5"
