    "question": "Poppy is solving a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, then her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. How many jigsaw pieces are left to be placed?",
    "completion": "To determine how many jigsaw pieces are left to be placed, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial number of pieces**: Poppy starts with 1000 pieces.\n\n2. **Pieces placed by Poppy**: Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1000 = 250\n   \\]\n   So, the number of pieces left after Poppy places her pieces is:\n   \\[\n   1000 - 250 = 750\n   \\]\n\n3. **Pieces placed by Poppy's mom**: Poppy's mom then places a third of the remaining pieces.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pieces placed by Poppy's mom} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 750 = 250\n   \\]\n   So, the number of pieces left after Poppy's mom places her pieces is:\n   \\[\n   750 - 250 = 500\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is \\(\\boxed{500}\\).",
    "answer": "Poppy has placed 1000 pieces / 4 = <<1000/4=250>>250 pieces.\nThis means there are 1000 \u2013 250 = <<1000-250=750>>750 pieces remaining.\nHer mom therefore places 750 / 3 = <<750/3=250>>250 pieces.\nThis leaves a total of 750 \u2013 250 = <<750-250=500>>500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.\n#### 500"
