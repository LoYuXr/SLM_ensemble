    "question": "Bobby takes a 30 min lunch and 2 15 minutes break per day at the office.  After 5 days, how many hours do his lunches and breaks add up to?",
    "completion": "To determine the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks over 5 days, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total time spent on lunch per day:**\n   - Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch break.\n   - Bobby takes a 215-minute lunch.\n   - Total time spent on lunch per day = 30 minutes + 215 minutes = 245 minutes.\n\n2. **Calculate the total time spent on lunch over 5 days:**\n   - Total time spent on lunch over 5 days = 245 minutes/day \u00d7 5 days = 1225 minutes.\n\n3. **Convert the total time spent on lunch from minutes to hours:**\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n   - Total time spent on lunch in hours = 1225 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes/hour = 20.4167 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks over 5 days is approximately 20.42 hours.",
    "answer": "He has 2 15 minutes breaks per day so together they add up to 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 minutes\nHe also has a 30-minute lunch every day so together with his 30-minute break he has a 30+30 = 60-minute break each day\nEvery day his breaks total 60 minutes and he takes these breaks 5 days per week so he takes 60*5 = <<60*5=300>>300 minutes of break time\n60 minutes is in an hour so 300/60 = <<300/60=5>>5 hours of break time\n#### 5"
