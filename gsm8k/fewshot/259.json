    "question": "Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and half as many bananas as Jamal. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. How many fruits are there if Andrea has 52 apples?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the number of apples that Jamal has as \\( A \\), the number of bananas that Jamal has as \\( B \\), and the number of apples that Andrea has as \\( A' \\). We are given the following information:\n\n1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.\n2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.\n3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.\n4. Andrea has 52 apples.\n\nFrom the information, we can write the following equations:\n\n1. \\( A' = A + 8 \\)\n2. \\( A' = \\frac{B}{2} \\)\n3. \\( B = A + 4 \\)\n4. \\( A' = 52 \\)\n\nFirst, we substitute \\( A' = 52 \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 52 = \\frac{B}{2} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( B \\):\n\n\\[ B = 2 \\times 52 = 104 \\]\n\nNow we know that Jamal has 104 bananas. Next, we substitute \\( B = 104 \\) into the third equation:\n\n\\[ 104 = A + 4 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( A \\):\n\n\\[ A = 104 - 4 = 100 \\]\n\nNow we know that Jamal has 100 apples. We can now find the number of bananas that Jamal has:\n\n\\[ B = 104 \\]\n\nFinally, we can find the number of apples that Andrea has:\n\n\\[ A' = 52 \\]\n\nSo, Andrea has 52 apples. Now we can find the total number of fruits:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total fruits} = A' + B + A = 52 + 104 + 100 = 256 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of fruits is 256.",
    "answer": "Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal has 52-8 = <<52-8=44>>44 apples.\nThe total number of apples is 44+52 = <<44+52=96>>96\nJamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44+4 = 48 bananas.\nAndrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which totals 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 bananas.\nThere are a total of 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 bananas.\nAltogether, there are 96 apples + 72 bananas = <<96+72=168>>168 fruits\n#### 168"
