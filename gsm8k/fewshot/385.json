    "question": "Lisa is part of a choir that has 52 members, 50% of which are boys and 50% of which are girls.  The choir decides to perform with just its female members.  On the day of the performance, however, half the people performing can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down.  The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. How many people sang in the performance?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of boys and girls in the choir.\n2. Determine how many of the choir members can perform.\n3. Calculate how many of the choir members can perform with the bus breakdown.\n4. Determine how many of the choir members can perform with the teachers.\n5. Calculate the total number of people who sang in the performance.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of boys and girls in the choir.\n   - The choir has 52 members.\n   - 50% of the members are boys, so the number of boys is \\(52 \\times 0.5 = 26\\).\n   - 50% of the members are girls, so the number of girls is \\(52 \\times 0.5 = 26\\).\n\n2. Determine how many of the choir members can perform.\n   - Half of the choir members can perform, so the number of choir members who can perform is \\(52 \\times 0.5 = 26\\).\n\n3. Calculate how many of the choir members can perform with the bus breakdown.\n   - Half of the choir members can perform with the bus breakdown, so the number of choir members who can perform with the bus breakdown is \\(26 \\times 0.5 = 13\\).\n\n4. Determine how many of the choir members can perform with the teachers.\n   - The 3 teachers decide to sing with them, so the number of choir members who can perform with the teachers is \\(26 - 13 = 13\\).\n\n5. Calculate the total number of people who sang in the performance.\n   - The total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the choir members who can perform, the choir members who can perform with the bus breakdown, and the choir members who can perform with the teachers.\n   - Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is \\(26 + 13 + 13 = 52\\).\n\nThe total number of people who sang in the performance is \\(\\boxed{52}\\).",
    "answer": "The 50 person choir is 50% female, so if the performance is just women there will be 52/2=26 people performing.\nIf half of those people can't make it to the performance, then there will be 26/2= <<26/2=13>>13 people performing.\nWhen the 3 teachers decide to participate, the performance now has 13+3=<<13+3=16>>16 people singing.\n#### 16"
