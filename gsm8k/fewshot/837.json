    "question": "Erika is saving for a new laptop. The laptop she wants costs $600. The sales assistant told her that if she traded in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200. She thinks this is a good deal and agrees to do it. She already has some savings in her purse, and has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. Her mom agrees to give her $80 to help her. If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the new laptop:**\n   The new laptop costs $600.\n\n2. **Determine the total amount Erika needs:**\n   Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount Erika has already saved:**\n   Erika has already saved $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total saved} = 150 + 80 = 230\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the remaining amount Erika needs:**\n   Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining amount} = 600 - 50 = 550\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the amount Erika has in her purse:**\n   Erika has already saved $230 and has $550 left to buy the laptop.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount in purse} = 230 + 550 = 780\n   \\]\n\nThus, Erika has \\(\\boxed{780}\\) dollars in her purse.",
    "answer": "Selling the old laptop reduced the cost of the new laptop to $600 \u2013 $200 = $<<600-200=400>>400 dollars.\nWe know she doesn't have all the money yet, so she actually has $400 \u2013 $50 = $<<400-50=350>>350 dollars.\nSome of this money came from her mom, so the money she had herself was $350 \u2013 $80 = $<<350-80=270>>270.\nSubtracting her part-time wages shows that she had $270 \u2013 $150 = $<<270-150=120>>120 in her purse.\n#### 120"
