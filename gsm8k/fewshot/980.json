    "question": "Adrianne is collecting different kinds of beads for making bracelets. Her mother gave her 20 metallic beads. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, and her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave.  How many beads did Adrianne have altogether?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from her mother, her sister, and her friend, and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. **Beads from her mother:**\n   Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.\n\n2. **Beads from her sister:**\n   Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother. Therefore, the number of beads from her sister is:\n   \\[\n   20 + 10 = 30\n   \\]\n\n3. **Beads from her friend:**\n   Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother. Therefore, the number of beads from her friend is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 20 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total number of beads:**\n   To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we sum the beads from her mother, her sister, and her friend:\n   \\[\n   20 + 30 + 40 = 90\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of beads Adrianne has is \\(\\boxed{90}\\).",
    "answer": "Adrianne received 20 +10 = <<20+10=30>>30 beads from her sister.\nAnd, she received 2 x 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 beads from her friend.\nTherefore, Adrianne had 20 + 30 + 40 = <<20+30+40=90>>90 beads altogether.\n#### 90"
