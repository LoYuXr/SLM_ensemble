    "question": "Mr. Jackson\u2019s fourth-grade class has 27 students. He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. The glue sticks come in packs of 8. How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?",
    "completion": "To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed for the class.\n2. Determine how many packs are required to get at least 2 glue sticks per student.\n3. Ensure that there is enough glue sticks left over.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.**\n\nThere are 27 students, and each student needs 2 glue sticks. So, the total number of glue sticks needed is:\n\\[ 27 \\times 2 = 54 \\text{ glue sticks} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many packs are required.**\n\nEach pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:\n\\[ \\frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \\]\n\nSince Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.\n\n**Step 3: Ensure there is enough glue sticks left over.**\n\nIf Mr. Jackson buys 7 packs, he will have:\n\\[ 7 \\times 8 = 56 \\text{ glue sticks} \\]\nThis means he will have 4 glue sticks left over. Since he needs at least 2 glue sticks per student, he will have enough glue sticks for all 27 students.\n\nTherefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy \\(\\boxed{7}\\) packs of glue sticks.",
    "answer": "Mr. Jackson will need 27 x 2 = <<27*2=54>>54 glue sticks.\nDivide the number of glue sticks by the amount in each pack, 54 / 8 = <<54/8=6.75>>6.75 packs.\nSince Mr. Jackson must buy whole packs, you must round 6.75 up to the next highest whole number, 7.\nMr. Jackson must buy 7 packs of glue sticks.\n#### 7"
