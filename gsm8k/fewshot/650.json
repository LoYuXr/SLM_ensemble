    "question": "On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. At the till she got $2 off because she had a voucher. The next day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, but the store also offered a 10% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 20 pomegranates. What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?",
    "completion": "To determine the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day and then find the difference.\n\n**Day 1:**\n1. Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost on Day 1} = 20 \\times 20 = 400 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. Clara received a $2 discount.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final price on Day 1} = 400 - 2 = 398 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n**Day 2:**\n1. The price of each pomegranate increased to $30.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost on Day 2} = 20 \\times 30 = 600 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount} = 0.10 \\times 600 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final price on Day 2} = 600 - 60 = 540 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n**Difference between the final prices:**\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 540 - 398 = 142 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is \\(\\boxed{142}\\).",
    "answer": "On Tuesday, the pomegranates cost Clara 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranates = $<<20*20=400>>400\nUsing the voucher, she paid $400 - $2 = $<<400-2=398>>398\nOn Wednesday, the pomegranates cost Sheila 20 pomegranates * $30 = $<<20*30=600>>600.\nShe then got a discount of 10/100 * $600 = $<<10/100*600=60>>60\nSheila ended up paying $600 - $60 = $<<600-60=540>>540\nThe difference is therefore $540 - $398 = $<<540-398=142>>142\n#### 142"
