    "question": "The area of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet. If the length of his room is 3 yards, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?",
    "completion": "To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the width of the room:**\n   The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width}\n   \\]\n   We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ yards} \\times 3 \\text{ feet/yard} = 9 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   Now we can use the area formula to find the width:\n   \\[\n   360 \\text{ square feet} = 9 \\text{ feet} \\times \\text{Width}\n   \\]\n   Solving for the width, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Width} = \\frac{360 \\text{ square feet}}{9 \\text{ feet}} = 40 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the perimeter of the room:**\n   The perimeter \\(P\\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width})\n   \\]\n   Substituting the length and width we found:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (9 \\text{ feet} + 40 \\text{ feet}) = 2 \\times 49 \\text{ feet} = 98 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the room is \\(\\boxed{98}\\) feet.",
    "answer": "The length of the room is 3 yards * (3 feet / 1 yard) = <<3*(3/1)=9>>9 feet.\nThe width of the room is 360 square feet / 9 feet = <<360/9=40>>40 feet.\nThe room's perimeter is 2(40+9) = 98\n#### 98"
