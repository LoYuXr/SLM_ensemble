    "question": "Benny saw a 10-foot shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?",
    "completion": "To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that is occupied by the remoras, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the length of the shark to inches:**\n   - The shark is 10 feet long.\n   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the shark is \\(10 \\times 12 = 120\\) inches long.\n\n2. **Convert the length of each remora to inches:**\n   - Each remora is 6 inches long.\n\n3. **Calculate the total length occupied by the remoras:**\n   - The total length occupied by the remoras is \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\) inches.\n\n4. **Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras:**\n   - The percentage is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total length of remoras}}{\\text{Total length of shark}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the values, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{12}{120} \\right) \\times 100 = 10\\%\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the shark's body length that is occupied by the remoras is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
    "answer": "First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<6*2=12>>12 inches\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1=1>>1 foot\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 10 feet * 100% = 10%\n#### 10"
