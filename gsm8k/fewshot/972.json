    "question": "Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges at the market. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each. Then she kept 1/4 of the oranges and sold the rest. How many oranges did Mrs. Harrington sell if each box contains 20 oranges?",
    "completion": "To determine how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought.\n2. Determine how many boxes she gave to her mom and her sister.\n3. Calculate how many boxes she kept.\n4. Determine how many boxes she sold.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ boxes} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many boxes she gave to her mom and her sister:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ boxes} \\text{ (to her mom)} + 2 \\text{ boxes} \\text{ (to her sister)} = 4 \\text{ boxes} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate how many boxes she kept:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ boxes} - 4 \\text{ boxes} = 8 \\text{ boxes} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many boxes she sold. Since she kept 1/4 of the oranges, we calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 8 \\text{ boxes} = 2 \\text{ boxes} \\]\n\nEach box contains 20 oranges, so the number of oranges she sold is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ boxes} \\times 20 \\text{ oranges/box} = 40 \\text{ oranges} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",
    "answer": "Mrs. Harrington gave a total of 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 boxes of oranges to her mom and sister.\nShe then had 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 boxes of oranges left.\nShe kept 8 x 1/4 = <<8*1/4=2>>2 boxes of oranges.\nSo, she had 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 boxes of oranges to be sold.\nHence, Mrs. Harrington sold 6 boxes x 20 oranges = <<6*20=120>>120 oranges.\n#### 120"
