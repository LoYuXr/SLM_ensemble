    "question": "Chase and Rider can ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days; but on two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. How many times do they ride their bikes a week?",
    "completion": "To determine how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days:\n- They ride thrice a day for 5 days.\n- So, the total number of times they ride on the usual days is \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the two other days:\n- They ride twice the times they do on usual days.\n- So, the number of times they ride on these two days is \\(2 \\times 15 = 30\\).\n\nNow, let's find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week:\n- The total number of times they ride on the usual days is 15.\n- The total number of times they ride on the two other days is 30.\n- Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is \\(15 + 30 = 45\\).\n\nSo, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
    "answer": "Each person rides his bike 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 times for 5 days.\nTogether, they ride 15+15 = <<15+15=30>>30 times for five days.\nEach person rides his bike 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 times for every day of the other two days.\nThis means each person rides 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 times on each day of the other two days.\nThe total for the other two days is 12+12 = <<12+12=24>>24\nFor the whole week the together ride 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 times\n#### 54"
