    "question": "Will buys 15 oranges. When he gets home, he asks his 2 sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old. The oldest son is 8 years old, the youngest is half as old as the oldest. How many oranges are left unwashed?",
    "completion": "To determine how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the age of the youngest son.\n2. Determine the total number of oranges washed by the sons.\n3. Subtract the number of unwashed oranges from the total number of oranges bought.\n\nFirst, let's find the age of the youngest son. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son. Since the oldest son is 8 years old, the youngest son is:\n\\[ \\text{Age of youngest son} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of oranges washed by the sons. The oldest son washes 15 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges washed is:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of oranges washed} = 15 + 4 = 19 \\text{ oranges} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of unwashed oranges from the total number of oranges bought. The total number of oranges bought is 15, so the number of unwashed oranges is:\n\\[ \\text{Number of unwashed oranges} = 15 - 19 = -4 \\]\n\nSince it is not possible to have a negative number of unwashed oranges, it means that the sons washed more oranges than the total number of oranges bought. Therefore, the number of unwashed oranges is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]",
    "answer": "The older son washes 8 oranges, so the younger son washes 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges.\nTogether they wash 8 oranges + 4 oranges =<<8+4=12>>12 oranges\nThere are 15 oranges - 12 oranges = <<15-12=3>>3 oranges left unwashed.\n#### 3"
