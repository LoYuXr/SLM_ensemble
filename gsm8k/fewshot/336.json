    "question": "Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each. The stock price increases 50% the first year Maria holds it, then decreases 25% in the second year. What is the final value of all Maria's shares?",
    "completion": "To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value of each share after the given price changes and then sum these values.\n\n1. **Initial Purchase:**\n   Maria buys 8 shares of the stock for $8 each.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial value} = 8 \\times 8 = 64 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **First Year:**\n   The stock price increases by 50%.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Increase in value} = 64 \\times 0.50 = 32 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{New value} = 64 + 32 = 96 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Second Year:**\n   The stock price decreases by 25%.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Decrease in value} = 96 \\times 0.25 = 24 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final value} = 96 - 24 = 72 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final value of all Maria's shares is \\(\\boxed{72}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "First find the initial total value of Maria's purchase: 8 shares * $8/share = $<<8*8=64>>64\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: $64 * .5 = $<<64*.5=32>>32\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: $64 + $32 = $<<64+32=96>>96\nThen multiply that amount by 25% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: $96 * 25% = $<<96*25*.01=24>>24\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: $96 - $24 = $<<96-24=72>>72\n#### 72"
