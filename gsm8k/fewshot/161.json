    "question": "Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. While Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. How many fish were they able to catch?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish each of them caught and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Anakin:\n- Anakin caught 10 starfish.\n- Anakin caught 6 sea horses.\n- Anakin caught 3 clownfish.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin:\n- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin. Therefore, Locsin caught \\(10 - 5 = 5\\) starfish.\n- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin. Therefore, Locsin caught \\(6 - 3 = 3\\) sea horses.\n- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin. Therefore, Locsin caught \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) clownfish.\n\nNow, we sum the number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:\n- Anakin caught \\(10 + 6 + 3 = 19\\) fish.\n- Locsin caught \\(5 + 3 + 5 = 13\\) fish.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin is:\n\\[19 + 13 = 32\\]\n\nThus, the total number of fish they were able to catch is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
    "answer": "Locsin caught 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 starfishes.\nThey caught 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 starfishes.\nLocsin caught 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 seahorses\nThey caught 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 seahorses\nLocsin caught 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 clownfish.\nSo, they caught 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 clownfish.\nTherefore, Anakin and Locsin were able to catch a total of 15 + 9 + 8 = <<15+9+8=32>>32 fish.\n#### 32"
