    "question": "John drinks a bottle of water every half hour.  A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes.  An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long.  How many bottles of water does he drink in that time?",
    "completion": "To determine how many bottles of water John drinks in the time it takes him to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle:**\n   - An extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 4 times the time it takes to solve a normal Sudoku puzzle.\n   - A normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes.\n   - Therefore, the time to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 45 \\text{ minutes} = 180 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes:**\n   - John drinks a bottle of water every half hour.\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n   - Therefore, in 180 minutes, John drinks:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{180 \\text{ minutes}}{0.5 \\text{ minutes per bottle}} = 360 \\text{ bottles}\n     \\]\n\nThus, John drinks \\(\\boxed{360}\\) bottles of water in the time it takes him to solve an extreme Sudoku puzzle.",
    "answer": "He drinks a bottle of water every 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 minutes\nIt takes him 45*4=<<45*4=180>>180 minutes to solve an extreme sudoku\nSo he drinks 180/30=<<180/30=6>>6 bottles in that time\n#### 6"
