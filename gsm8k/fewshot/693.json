    "question": "Brittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares. The comforter had 14 red squares, 4 more blue squares than red squares, 6 more green squares than blue squares, and 12 fewer white squares than green squares.  How many square feet is Brittany's comforter?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of square feet in Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color of square and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Red Squares:**\n   - The comforter has 14 red squares.\n\n2. **Blue Squares:**\n   - The comforter has 4 more blue squares than red squares.\n   - Number of blue squares = 14 (red squares) + 4 = 18 blue squares.\n\n3. **Green Squares:**\n   - The comforter has 6 more green squares than blue squares.\n   - Number of green squares = 18 (blue squares) + 6 = 24 green squares.\n\n4. **White Squares:**\n   - The comforter has 12 fewer white squares than green squares.\n   - Number of white squares = 24 (green squares) - 12 = 12 white squares.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of square feet in the quilted comforter by multiplying the number of each color of square by the area of one square (which is 1 square foot).\n\n- **Red Squares:**\n  - Area = 14 square feet.\n\n- **Blue Squares:**\n  - Area = 18 square feet.\n\n- **Green Squares:**\n  - Area = 24 square feet.\n\n- **White Squares:**\n  - Area = 12 square feet.\n\nNow, we sum up the areas of all the squares:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Area} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Area} = 68 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of square feet in Brittany's quilted comforter is \\(\\boxed{68}\\).",
    "answer": "With 4 more blue than red squares, the comforter has 14+4=<<14+4=18>>18 blue squares.\nWith 6 more green than blue squares, the comforter has 24 green squares.\nWith 12 fewer white squares than green squares, the comforter has 12 white squares.\nIn total, the comforter has 14+18+24+12 = <<14+18+24+12=68>>68 squares that are 1-foot by 1-foot in size.\nSince each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, then each square equals one square foot.\nThus, the comforter is 68 square feet.\n#### 68"
