    "question": "Jerry has two pools, both with leaks emptying them out at 4 gallons/minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool as \\( S \\) gallons. According to the problem, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago. Therefore, the amount of water in the big pool four minutes ago was \\( 2S \\) gallons.\n\nSince Jerry's pools have leaks that empty them out at 4 gallons per minute, the rate at which the water leaks out of the big pool is \\( 4 \\) gallons per minute, and the rate at which the water leaks out of the small pool is \\( 4 \\) gallons per minute. The difference in the amount of water in the big pool and the small pool is the amount of water that leaks out each minute.\n\nThe difference in the amount of water in the big pool and the small pool is:\n\\[ 2S - S = S \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nThis difference of \\( S \\) gallons per minute is equal to the amount of water that leaks out each minute. Since the leaks are happening at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water that leaks out each minute is:\n\\[ \\frac{S}{4} \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nSince this amount of water leaks out each minute, the amount of water that leaks out in 4 minutes is:\n\\[ 4 \\times \\frac{S}{4} = S \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nThis means that the big pool has \\( S \\) gallons less water than the small pool. Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool now is:\n\\[ S + S = 2S \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nSo, the small pool now has \\(\\boxed{2S}\\) gallons of water.",
    "answer": "First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons\nLet b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)\nMultiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32\nSubtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32\nSubtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16\nDividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8\n#### 8"
