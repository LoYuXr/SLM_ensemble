    "question": "Annika brought $50 to the town fair. She spent half of it on food and snacks, and an additional $10 for rides. How much, in dollars, is left?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Annika has left after her expenditures, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount spent on food and snacks.\n2. Subtract the amount spent on food and snacks from the total amount brought by Annika.\n\nFirst, we know that Annika brought $50 to the town fair. She spent half of this amount on food and snacks. So, we calculate the amount spent on food and snacks as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount spent on food and snacks} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the $10 she spent on rides to the $25 she spent on food and snacks:\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount spent} = 25 + 10 = 35 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount of money Annika brought:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount left} = 50 - 35 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money left with Annika is \\boxed{15}.",
    "answer": "She spent 50/2=$<<50/2=25>>25 on the food.\nThen 50-25-10=$<<50-25-10=15>>15 are left.\n#### 15"
