    "question": "If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, how much would a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the compounded effect of a 20% increase every two months. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Price**: The original price of the bag of marbles is $20.\n\n2. **First Two Months**: The price increases by 20%.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price after 2 months} = 20 + 0.20 \\times 20 = 20 + 4 = 24\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Two Months**: The price increases by another 20%.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price after 4 months} = 24 + 0.20 \\times 24 = 24 + 4.8 = 28.8\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Two Months**: The price increases by another 20%.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price after 6 months} = 28.8 + 0.20 \\times 28.8 = 28.8 + 5.76 = 34.56\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Two Months**: The price increases by another 20%.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price after 8 months} = 34.56 + 0.20 \\times 34.56 = 34.56 + 6.912 = 41.472\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Two Months**: The price increases by another 20%.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price after 10 months} = 41.472 + 0.20 \\times 41.472 = 41.472 + 8.2944 = 49.7664\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Two Months**: The price increases by another 20%.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price after 12 months} = 49.7664 + 0.20 \\times 49.7664 = 49.7664 + 9.95328 = 59.71968\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Two Months",
    "answer": "When the price of the bag of marble increase by 20%, the price increases by 20/100*20 = $<<20/100*20=4>>4\nIf the price increases after every two months, in 36 months, it will increase 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 times.\nIf each increase is $4, the total amount the price of the bag of marbles will have increased by after 36 months is 18*$4 = $<<18*4=72>>72\nAfter the total increase of the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, the total cost will be $20+$72 = $<<20+72=92>>92\n#### 92"
