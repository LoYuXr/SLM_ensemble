    "question": "In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. In how many years will her age be thrice her present age?",
    "completion": "To determine in how many years Melanie's age will be thrice her present age, we start by defining her current age as \\( x \\). According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ x + 10 = 18 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ x = 18 - 10 \\]\n\\[ x = 8 \\]\n\nSo, Melanie's current age is 8. We need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. This means we need to find \\( y \\) such that:\n\n\\[ x + y = 3x \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 8 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 8 + y = 3 \\times 8 \\]\n\\[ 8 + y = 24 \\]\n\nTo find \\( y \\), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ y = 24 - 8 \\]\n\\[ y = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, in 10 years, Melanie's age will be three times her present age. The answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Melanie's present age is 18 - 10 = <<18-10=8>>8.\nThrice Melanie's present age is 8 x 3 = <<8*3=24>>24.\nSo, she will be thrice her present age in 24 - 8 = 16 years.\n#### 16"
