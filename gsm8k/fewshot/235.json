    "question": "John orders some pizzas to share with his friends.  There are 20 friends in total, and John wants to make sure each can have 4 slices.  Pizzas are only sold sliced into 8 portions.  How many Pizzas does John need to order?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.\n2. Determine how many slices each pizza provides.\n3. Calculate the number of pizzas required based on the total number of slices needed.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of pizza slices needed. Since there are 20 friends and each friend wants 4 slices, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices each friend wants:\n\n\\[ 20 \\text{ friends} \\times 4 \\text{ slices per friend} = 80 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many slices each pizza provides. Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:\n\n\\[ \\frac{80 \\text{ slices}}{8 \\text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \\text{ pizzas} \\]\n\nTherefore, John needs to order \\(\\boxed{10}\\) pizzas.",
    "answer": "John's 20 friends each need 4 slices, so that means 4*20= <<4*20=80>>80 slices are needed\nEach pizza has 8 slices, so to get 80 slices in total 80/8= <<80/8=10>>10 pizzas are needed\n#### 10"
