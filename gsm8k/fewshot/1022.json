    "question": "Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $120 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $4. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?",
    "completion": "To determine how many small stuffed animals Teresa sold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( L \\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.\n   - Let \\( S \\) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations:**\n   - The price of a large stuffed animal is $4.\n   - The price of a small stuffed animal is three times the price of a large stuffed animal, so it is \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\) dollars.\n   - Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so \\( S = 2L \\).\n\n3. **Total Earnings Equation:**\n   - The total earnings from selling the stuffed animals is $120.\n   - The total earnings from selling large stuffed animals is \\( 4L \\).\n   - The total earnings from selling small stuffed animals is \\( 12S \\).\n   - Therefore, the total earnings equation is:\n     \\[\n     4L + 12S = 120\n     \\]\n\n4. **Substitute \\( S \\) with \\( 2L \\):**\n   - Substitute \\( S = 2L \\) into the earnings equation:\n     \\[\n     4L + 12(2L) = 120\n     \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the Equation:**\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     4L + 24L = 120\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     28L = 120\n     \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\( L \\):**\n   - Divide both sides by 28:\n     \\[\n     L = \\frac{120}{28}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     L = \\frac{30}{7}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     L \\approx 4.29\n     \\]\n\n7. **Calculate \\( S \\):**\n   - Since \\( S = 2L \\):\n     \\[\n     S = 2 \\times \\frac{30}{7}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{60}{7}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     S \\approx 8.57\n     \\]\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - Teresa sold approximately 4 large stuffed animals and 8.57 small stuffed",
    "answer": "Let A be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.\nThus, she sold 2A small stuffed animals.\nLarge stuffed animals cost 3 * 4 = $<<3*4=12>>12.\nShe earned 12A + 4 * 2A = 12A + 8A = 20A = $120 from selling stuffed animals today.\nThus, she sold A = 120 / 20 = <<120/20=6>>6 large stuffed animals today.\nTeresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, so she sold 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 small stuffed animals today.\n#### 12"
