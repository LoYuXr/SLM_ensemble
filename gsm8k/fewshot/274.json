    "question": "It's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season. She has bought 20 packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. If a packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30, how much money did she use to buy the seeds?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of the seeds Mrs. Rylan bought, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:\n- Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.\n- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the tomato seeds is:\n  \\[\n  20 \\text{ packets} \\times \\$40 \\text{ per packet} = \\$800\n  \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the celery seeds:\n- Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds.\n- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the celery seeds is:\n  \\[\n  80 \\text{ packets} \\times \\$30 \\text{ per packet} = \\$2400\n  \\]\n\nNow, we add the total costs of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds to find the overall cost:\n\\[\n\\$800 + \\$2400 = \\$3200\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is \\(\\boxed{3200}\\).",
    "answer": "The total amount of money she used to buy the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40/packet = $<<20*40=800>>800\nThe celery seeds cost her 80 packets * $30/packet = $<<80*30=2400>>2400\nFor the seeds, Mrs. Rylan paid $2400 + $800 = $<<2400+800=3200>>3200\n#### 3200"
