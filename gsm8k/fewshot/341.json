    "question": "A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the same as a green toad, 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, but 20 pounds more than a red bird. If the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal if the container also weighs 20 pounds.",
    "completion": "To determine the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to first find the weights of the pink frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, the yellow snake, and the red bird. We know the following:\n\n1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.\n2. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle.\n3. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad.\n4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake.\n5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird.\n\nLet's denote the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird as \\( P \\), \\( B \\), \\( G \\), \\( Y \\), and \\( R \\) respectively. We know that \\( P = 50 \\) pounds. From the information given, we can write the following equations:\n\n1. \\( P = B \\)\n2. \\( P = G \\)\n3. \\( P = Y - 10 \\)\n4. \\( P = R + 20 \\)\n\nSince \\( P = 50 \\) pounds, we can substitute this value into the equations to find the weights of the other animals:\n\n1. \\( B = 50 \\) pounds\n2. \\( G = 50 \\) pounds\n3. \\( Y = P + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 \\) pounds\n4. \\( R = P - 20 = 50 - 20 = 30 \\) pounds\n\nNow, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total weight} = P + B + G + Y + R = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is \\(\\boxed{240}\\) pounds.",
    "answer": "Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.\nThe pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.\nIf you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.\nThe pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.\nAll the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds\nIf the animals are in a container weighing 20 pounds, the total weight of the full container is 240+20 = 260 pounds\n#### 260"
