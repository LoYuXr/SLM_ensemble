    "question": "Nancy is returning her overdue books to the library. She owes $0.50 cents each on 8 books, plus a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. How much does she have to pay total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate each part carefully.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the books:**\n   Nancy owes $0.50 cents each on 8 books. First, we need to convert this cost into dollars:\n   \\[\n   0.50 \\text{ cents} = 0.005 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Now, we calculate the total cost for 8 books:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 0.005 = 0.04 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add the flat fee:**\n   Nancy also has a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that is over a week overdue. Therefore, we add this flat fee to the cost of the books:\n   \\[\n   0.04 + 2.00 = 2.04 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2.04}\n\\]",
    "answer": "First multiply the late fee per book by the number of books: $0.50/book * 8 books = $<<0.5*8=4.00>>4.00\nThen add the \"more than a week overdue\" fee to the answer from the previous step to find the total: $4.00 + $2.00 = $<<4+2=6.00>>6.00\n#### 6"
