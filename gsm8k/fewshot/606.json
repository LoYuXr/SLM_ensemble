    "question": "Every 2 miles a car drives the tires rotate 725 times.  Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.  If each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations how many years before the tire needs to be replaced?",
    "completion": "To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tires will make over the course of 400 miles of driving and then find out how many years it will take for the tire to make that many rotations.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of rotations the tires will make over 400 miles of driving:\n\\[ 400 \\text{ miles} \\times 725 \\text{ rotations per mile} = 280,000 \\text{ rotations} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tire to make 280,000 rotations. We know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. Therefore, the number of years required is:\n\\[ \\frac{280,000 \\text{ rotations}}{10,440,000 \\text{ rotations per year}} \\approx 0.0271 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nTo convert this time into years and months, we note that 0.0271 years is approximately 0.0271 years, which is 2 years and 3 months (since 0.0271 years is approximately 2 years and 3 months).\n\nTherefore, the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2.71} \\]",
    "answer": "Jeremy drives 400/2=<<400/2=200>>200 segments of 2 miles\nThat means each month the car undergoes 200*725=<<200*725=145000>>145,000 rotations\nSo the tire can last for 10,440,000/145,000=<<10440000/145000=72>>72 months\nThat means the tires will last 72/12=<<72/12=6>>6 years\n#### 6"
