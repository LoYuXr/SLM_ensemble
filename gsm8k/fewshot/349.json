    "question": "Every month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog. Food costs $25 per week. Treats cost $20 per month. Medicine costs $100 per month. How much money does Madeline spend on her dog per year if there are 4 weeks in a month?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply by the number of months in a year.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the monthly expenses:\n- Food costs $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly food cost is:\n  \\[\n  25 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 100 \\text{ dollars/month}\n  \\]\n- Treats cost $20 per month.\n- Medicine costs $100 per month.\n\nNext, we sum up the monthly expenses:\n\\[\n100 \\text{ dollars/month} + 20 \\text{ dollars/month} + 100 \\text{ dollars/month} = 220 \\text{ dollars/month}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the annual expenses by multiplying the monthly expense by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):\n\\[\n220 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 2640 \\text{ dollars/year}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Madeline spends \\(\\boxed{2640}\\) dollars on her dog per year.",
    "answer": "Madeline spends$25*4=$<<25*4=100>>100 on food for her dog per month.\nShe spends $100+$20+$100=$<<100+20+100=220>>220 on her dog per month.\nShe will spend $220*12=$<<220*12=2640>>2640 on her dog per year\n#### 2640"
