    "question": "A three-toed sloth moves very slowly, and only eats when he is up in his tree.  For a meal of berries, it takes the sloth 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.  Assuming he picks the same number of berries on each trip, what is the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours?",
    "completion": "To determine the least number of berries the three-toed sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total time available for the sloth:**\n   The sloth has 8 hours to collect berries.\n\n2. **Determine the time required to collect 24 berries:**\n   Since the sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip, we need to find the time required to collect 24 berries.\n\n3. **Calculate the time per trip:**\n   The sloth takes 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up. Therefore, the time per trip is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time per trip} = \\frac{4 \\text{ hours}}{2} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of berries collected per trip:**\n   Since the sloth collects 24 berries in 8 hours, the number of berries collected per trip is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Berries per trip} = \\frac{24 \\text{ berries}}{8 \\text{ hours}} = 3 \\text{ berries per hour}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of berries collected in 8 hours:**\n   If the sloth collects 3 berries per hour, the total number of berries collected in 8 hours is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total berries} = 3 \\text{ berries per hour} \\times 8 \\text{ hours} = 24 \\text{ berries}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
    "answer": "If one trip is 4-hours long, in 8 hours he can make 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 trips.\nTo collect 24 berries per 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 berries per trip.\n#### 12"
