    "question": "Miss Albert's class is composed of 12 boys and 12 girls. One-third of the girls and one-fourth of the boys are on varsity. How many students are not on varsity?",
    "completion": "To determine how many students are not on varsity, we need to calculate the number of students on varsity and then subtract that from the total number of students.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many girls are on varsity. Since one-fourth of the girls are on varsity, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls on varsity} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 = 3\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many boys are on varsity. Since one-third of the boys are on varsity, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of boys on varsity} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 = 4\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls on varsity and the number of boys on varsity:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of students on varsity} = 3 + 4 = 7\n\\]\n\nFinally, to find the number of students who are not on varsity, we subtract the total number of students on varsity from the total number of students:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students not on varsity} = 12 + 12 - 7 = 17\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of students who are not on varsity is \\boxed{17}.",
    "answer": "There are 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 students in Miss Albert's class.\n12 x 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 girls are on varsity.\n12 x 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 boys are on varsity.\nA total of 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 students in Miss Albert's class are on varsity.\nTherefore, 24 - 7 = <<24-7=17>>17 students are not on varsity.\n#### 17"
