    "question": "In a jewelers store, the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell. The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold. If a diamond Jewell is $2000, find the total price for all three jewels.",
    "completion": "To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to determine the price of each type of jewel and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Price of a diamond Jewell:**\n   The price of a diamond Jewell is given as $2000.\n\n2. **Price of a gold Jewell:**\n   The price of a gold Jewell is \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) times the price of a diamond Jewell.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price of gold Jewell} = \\frac{4}{5} \\times 2000 = \\frac{4 \\times 2000}{5} = \\frac{8000}{5} = 1600\n   \\]\n\n3. **Price of a silver Jewell:**\n   The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price of silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total price for all three jewels:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total price} = \\text{Price of diamond Jewell} + \\text{Price of gold Jewell} + \\text{Price of silver Jewell}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total price for all three jewels is \\(\\boxed{4800}\\).",
    "answer": "If a diamond Jewellcosts $2000, the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5*$2000 = $1600\nSilver costs $400 less than gold Jewell, which means a silver Jewell costs $1600-$400 = $1200\nThe price of the three jewels combined is $1200+$1600+$2000 = $<<1200+1600+2000=4800>>4800\n#### 4800"
