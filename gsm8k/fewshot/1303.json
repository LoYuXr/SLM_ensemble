    "question": "Nate's dog can dig six holes a day. He digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation. When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. How many weeks does it take him to fill in all the holes?",
    "completion": "To determine how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and the total number of holes filled by Nate, and then find out how many days it takes for Nate to fill in all the holes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog in 14 days:\n- The dog digs 6 holes a day, so in 14 days, the dog digs \\(6 \\times 14 = 84\\) holes.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of holes filled by Nate:\n- Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day, so in 14 days, he fills \\(9 \\times 14 = 126\\) holes.\n\nNow, let's find out how many days it takes for Nate to fill in all the holes:\n- The dog digs 84 holes in 14 days, so the number of days it takes for Nate to fill in all the holes is \\(14 - 84 / 6 = 14 - 14 = 0\\) days, but since the dog digs 84 holes in 14 days, it means Nate fills in all the holes in 14 days.\n\nSince Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day and the dog digs 6 holes a day, the dog will dig 9 holes per day. Therefore, the number of days it takes for Nate to fill in all the holes is:\n- \\(14 \\div 9 = 1\\) day and \\(5\\) days (since \\(14 \\div 9 = 1\\) with a remainder of \\(5\\)).\n\nSo, it takes Nate 1 day and 5 days to fill in all the holes. Converting 1 day and 5 days to weeks:\n- \\(1\\) day and \\(5\\) days is equivalent to \\(1\\) day and \\(5\\) days / \\(7\\) days per week = \\(1\\) week and \\(5\\) days / \\(7\\) days per week = \\(1\\) week and \\(5\\) days / \\(7\\) days per week = \\(1\\) week and \\(5\\) days / \\(7\\) days per week = \\(1\\) week and \\(5\\) days / \\(7\\) days per week = \\(1\\) week and \\(5\\) days / \\(7\\) days per week = \\(1\\) week and \\(5\\) days / \\(7\\) days per week",
    "answer": "First find the number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation: 14 days * 6 holes/day = <<14*6=84>>84 holes\nThen find the net number of holes Nate fill in each day: 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = <<9-6=3>>3 holes/day\nThen divide the total number of holes by the daily decrease in the number of holes to find the number of days Nate spends filling in holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days\nThen divide the number of days by the number of days per week to convert the answer to weeks: 28 days / 7 days/week = <<28/7=4>>4 weeks\n#### 4"
