    "question": "Bernie has 4 dogs. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The first needs to walk 1 mile. The second needs to walk 4 miles. The third needs to walk 3 miles. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. How many miles does the last dog need?",
    "completion": "To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we start by calculating the total number of miles the first three dogs need to walk. The first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second dog needs to walk 4 miles, and the third dog needs to walk 3 miles. Adding these together, we get:\n\n\\[1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \\text{ miles}\\]\n\nNext, we know that the average number of miles each dog needs to walk per day is 3 miles. To find the total number of miles the dogs need to walk in a day, we multiply the average number of miles per dog by the number of dogs:\n\n\\[3 \\text{ miles/dog} \\times 4 \\text{ dogs} = 12 \\text{ miles}\\]\n\nSince the total number of miles the dogs need to walk in a day is 12 miles, and we already calculated that the first three dogs need to walk 8 miles, the last dog must have walked the remaining miles. Therefore, the last dog needs to walk:\n\n\\[12 \\text{ miles} - 8 \\text{ miles} = 4 \\text{ miles}\\]\n\nSo, the last dog needs to walk \\(\\boxed{4}\\) miles.",
    "answer": "The total walk distance must be 12 miles because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12\nThe first three walk a total of 8 miles because 1 + 4 + 3 = <<1+4+3=8>>8\nThe last one needs 4 miles because 12 - 8 = <<12-8=4>>4\n#### 4"
