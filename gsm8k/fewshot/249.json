    "question": "On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 the next day. If 1 cookie has 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue consume than her sister?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Tuesday.\n2. Determine the total number of cookies eaten by both Sue and her sister.\n3. Calculate the total number of calories consumed by both.\n4. Find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate on Tuesday. According to the problem, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday. Since her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, Sue ate:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ cookies} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of cookies eaten by both Sue and her sister. The sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, so the total number of cookies eaten by the sister is:\n\\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \\text{ cookies} \\]\nThe total number of cookies eaten by Sue is:\n\\[ 10 + 18 = 28 \\text{ cookies} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of calories consumed by both. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total number of calories consumed by Sue is:\n\\[ 28 \\times 200 = 5600 \\text{ calories} \\]\nThe total number of calories consumed by her sister is:\n\\[ 18 \\times 200 = 3600 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister:\n\\[ 5600 - 3600 = 2000 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nThus, Sue consumed \\(\\boxed{2000}\\) more calories than her sister.",
    "answer": "Sue\u2019s Monday cookie intake is 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20.\nSue\u2019s Tuesday cookie intake is 2*13 = <<2*13=26>>26.\nTotal cookies Sue consumed is 20+26 = <<20+26=46>>46.\nSue\u2019s sister ate a total of 5+13 = <<5+13=18>>18 cookies.\nSue ate 46-18=<<46-18=28>>28 more cookies.\nSue consumed 28*200=<<28*200=5600>>5,600 more calories.\n#### 5,600"
