    "question": "In a certain school, two classes have a total of 80 students. Each class has the same amount of students, and in each class 40% of the students are girls. How many boys are in each class?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of boys in each class, we start by defining the number of students in each class as \\( x \\). Since each class has the same number of students, the total number of students in both classes is given by:\n\n\\[ 2x = 80 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{80}{2} = 40 \\]\n\nSo, each class has 40 students. Next, we need to find out how many girls and boys are in each class. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:\n\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 40 = 16 \\]\n\nSince the total number of students in each class is 40, the number of boys in each class is:\n\n\\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \\]\n\nThus, the number of boys in each class is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
    "answer": "If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.\nThe girls in each class make up to 40%, so there are 40/100 * 40 = <<40/100*40=16>>16 girls in each of them.\nThat means the rest of the class are boys, so there are 40 - 16 = <<40-16=24>>24 boys in each class.\n#### 24"
