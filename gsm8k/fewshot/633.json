    "question": "Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, driving 55 miles per hour. Tom is driving 70 miles per hour. How long will it take Tom to catch up with Bob?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to cover the initial distance between them, which is 75 miles, at his speed of 70 miles per hour.\n\nThe formula to calculate time is:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{75 \\text{ miles}}{70 \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]\n\nPerforming the division:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{75}{70} \\approx 1.0714 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, it will take Tom approximately 1.0714 hours to catch up with Bob. To convert this time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\\[ 1.0714 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} \\approx 64.284 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest minute, it will take Tom approximately 64 minutes to catch up with Bob.",
    "answer": "Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour to Bob's 55 miles per hour, meaning Tom is gaining at a rate of 70 mph - 55 mph = <<70-55=15>>15 mph.\nBob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, and if Tom is gaining 15 mph on him, it will take Tom 75 miles / 15 mph = <<75/15=5>>5 hours to catch up with Bob.\n#### 5"
