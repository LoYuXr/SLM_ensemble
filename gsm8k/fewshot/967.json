    "question": "Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. What is the total age of all three of the family members?",
    "completion": "To determine the total age of all three family members, we need to calculate the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister step by step.\n\n1. **Nani's Age:**\n   Nani is 8 years old.\n\n2. **Brother's Age:**\n   Nani's brother is twice Nani's age.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Brother's age} = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sister's Age:**\n   Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. This means she is 75% of Nani's age.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \\times 8 = 6 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Age of All Three Family Members:**\n   Now, we sum the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 20 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total age of all three family members is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
    "answer": "Nani's brother is 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 years old.\nNani's sister is 25/100 * 8 = <<25/100*8=2>>2 years younger than he is.\nThat means she is 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 years old.\nIn total all mentioned family members, are 16 + 6 + 8 = <<16+6+8=30>>30 years old.\n#### 30"
