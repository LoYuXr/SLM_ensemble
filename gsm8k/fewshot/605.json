    "question": "For four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup.  In the next two hours, he sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup.  How much money did Patrick earn, in dollars, from selling lemonade for 6 hours?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to calculate the total earnings from each segment of his sales and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the earnings from the first segment of his sales:\n- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour for 4 hours.\n- The price per cup is $0.50.\n- Therefore, the total earnings from the first segment are:\n  \\[\n  15 \\text{ cups/hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$0.50 \\text{ per cup} = 15 \\times 4 \\times 0.50 = 30 \\times 0.50 = \\$15\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the earnings from the second segment of his sales:\n- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour for 2 hours.\n- The price per cup is $0.60.\n- Therefore, the total earnings from the second segment are:\n  \\[\n  10 \\text{ cups/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$0.60 \\text{ per cup} = 10 \\times 2 \\times 0.60 = 20 \\times 0.60 = \\$12\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the earnings from both segments to find the total earnings:\n\\[\n\\$15 + \\$12 = \\$27\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is \\(\\boxed{27}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Patrick earned $0.50 x 15 = $<<0.5*15=7.50>>7.50 from selling the lemonade for $0.50 per cup.\nSo for four hours, his total earnings are $7.50 x 4 = $<<7.5*4=30>>30.\nHe earned $0.60 x 10 = $<<0.60*10=6>>6 from selling the lemonade for $0.60 per cup.\nSo for two hours, his total earnings are $6 x 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.\nTherefore, Patrick earn a total of $30 + $12 = $<<30+12=42>>42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.\n#### 42"
