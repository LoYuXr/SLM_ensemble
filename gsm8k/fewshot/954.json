    "question": "Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. If he has two dozen cups and gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons for his birthday, calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining.",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has.\n2. Determine the total number of utensils before Pedro receives any.\n3. Subtract the number of utensils Pedro receives from the total number of utensils.\n\nFirst, we know that Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Since he has 2 dozen cups, he has:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ measuring cups} \\]\n\nLet \\( M \\) be the number of measuring spoons. According to the problem, \\( M = \\frac{2}{3}M \\). To find \\( M \\), we can solve the equation:\n\\[ M = \\frac{2}{3}M \\]\n\\[ M - \\frac{2}{3}M = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3}M = 0 \\]\n\\[ M = 0 \\]\n\nThis means that Jonathan has 0 measuring spoons. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is 0.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of utensils before Pedro receives any. Since he has 0 measuring spoons, he has:\n\\[ 0 + 24 = 24 \\text{ utensils} \\]\n\nPedro receives 6 measuring spoons, so the total number of utensils he has is:\n\\[ 24 + 6 = 30 \\text{ utensils} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of utensils Pedro receives from the total number of utensils:\n\\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]",
    "answer": "A dozen measuring cups are 12, and if Jonathan has two dozens, he has 2*12 = 24 cups.\nJonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, so he has 2/3*24 = <<2/3*24=16>>16 measuring spoons.\nWhen he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he remains with 16-6 = <<16-6=10>>10 measuring spoons.\nHe now has a total of 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = <<10+24=34>>34 utensils\n#### 34"
