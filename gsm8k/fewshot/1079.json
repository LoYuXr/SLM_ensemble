    "question": "A $2000 watch was put on sale so that Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it. What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?",
    "completion": "To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the original price of the watch:**\n   The watch was originally priced at $2000.\n\n2. **Determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch:**\n   Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \\times 0.75 = 1500\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for:**\n   Mr. Rogers sold the watch at 120% of the price he bought it for.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price Mr. Rogers sold} = 1500 \\times 1.20 = 1800\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend:**\n   The discount is the difference between the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for and the original price.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount} = 1800 - 2000 = -200\n   \\]\n   Since the discount is negative, it means Mr. Rogers' friend received a discount of $200.\n\n5. **Calculate the percentage discount:**\n   The percentage discount is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Discount} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Discount}}{\\text{Original Price}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Discount} = \\left( \\frac{-200}{2000} \\right) \\times 100 = -10\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \\boxed{-10\\%}.",
    "answer": "Mr. Roger bought the perfume at $2000 x 75/100 = $<<2000*75/100=1500>>1500.\nHe then sold it to his friend at $1500 x 120/100 = $<<1500*120/100=1800>>1800\nSo, Mr. Roger's friend paid $2000 - $1800 = $<<2000-1800=200>>200 less than the original price.\nSo, his friend got $200/$2000 x 100% = <<200/2000*100=10>>10% discount.\n#### 10"
