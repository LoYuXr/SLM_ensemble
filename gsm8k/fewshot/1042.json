    "question": "Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the first race, he lost $5. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?",
    "completion": "To determine Johnny's dad's average loss over the three races, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.\n\n1. **First Race:**\n   Johnny lost $5.\n\n2. **Second Race:**\n   Johnny won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\n   \\]\n   So, Johnny won $11 in the second race.\n\n3. **Third Race:**\n   Johnny lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost:\n   \\[\n   1.5 \\times 11 = 16.5\n   \\]\n   So, Johnny lost $16.5 in the third race.\n\nNext, we sum up the losses from all three races:\n\\[\n5 + 11 + 16.5 = 32.5\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the average loss by dividing the total loss by the number of races:\n\\[\n\\frac{32.5}{3} = \\frac{65}{6} \\approx 10.83\n\\]\n\nThus, Johnny's dad's average loss over the three races is \\(\\boxed{10.83}\\).",
    "answer": "On the second race he won $11 because 1+ 5 x 2 = <<1+5*2=11>>11\nOn the third race he lost $15 because 10 x 1.5 = <<10*1.5=15>>15\nHe lost a total of $20 on the first and third races because 15 + 5 = <<15+5=20>>20\n\nHe lost $9 that day because 11 - 20 = <<11-20=-9>>-9\nHe lost an average of $3 per race because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3\n#### 3"
