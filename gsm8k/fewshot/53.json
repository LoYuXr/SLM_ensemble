    "question": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on Friday compared to Thursday, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:\n- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, and each truck tire costs $60.\n- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires, and each car tire costs $40.\n- Total revenue for Thursday = (Number of truck tires repaired) \u00d7 (Cost per truck tire) + (Number of car tires repaired) \u00d7 (Cost per car tire)\n- Total revenue for Thursday = (6 \u00d7 60) + (4 \u00d7 40)\n- Total revenue for Thursday = 360 + 160\n- Total revenue for Thursday = $520\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:\n- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires, and each car tire costs $40.\n- Total revenue for Friday = (Number of car tires repaired) \u00d7 (Cost per car tire)\n- Total revenue for Friday = 12 \u00d7 40\n- Total revenue for Friday = $480\n\nNow, we find the difference in revenue between Friday and Thursday:\n- Difference in revenue = Total revenue on Friday - Total revenue on Thursday\n- Difference in revenue = $480 - $520\n- Difference in revenue = -$40\n\nSince the difference is negative, it means the mechanic earned $40 less on Friday compared to Thursday.\n\nTherefore, the mechanic earned \\(\\boxed{40}\\) dollars less on Friday compared to Thursday.",
    "answer": "On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $<<6*60+4*40=520>>520.\nOn Friday the mechanic charged a total of 12*40 = $<<12*40=480>>480.\nThus, on Thursday, the day with higher revenue, the mechanic had 520-480 = $<<520-480=40>>40 more revenue than on Friday.\n#### 40"
