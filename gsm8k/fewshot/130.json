    "question": "Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her department store's Santa village. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them, then 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. How many elves are left?",
    "completion": "To determine how many elves are left after the specified events, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial number of elves**: 60 elves.\n2. **Elves who quit after vomiting**: A third of the elves quit.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\text{ elves}\n   \\]\n3. **Remaining elves after vomiting**: Subtract the 20 elves who quit.\n   \\[\n   60 - 20 = 40 \\text{ elves}\n   \\]\n4. **Elves who quit after kicking their shins**: 10 of the remaining 40 elves quit.\n   \\[\n   40 - 10 = 30 \\text{ elves}\n   \\]\n5. **Remaining elves after kicking their shins**: Subtract the 10 elves who quit.\n   \\[\n   30 - 10 = 20 \\text{ elves}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of elves left is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
    "answer": "First, divide the starting number of elves by 3 to find out how many quit after being vomited on, which is 60 elves / 3 = <<60/3=20>>20 elves.\nThen subtract that number from the starting number of elves to find out how many are left: 60 elves - 20 elves = <<60-20=40>>40 elves.\nThen subtract the number of elves who quit after being kicked to find the total number who left: 40 elves - 10 elves = <<40-10=30>>30 elves.\n#### 30"
