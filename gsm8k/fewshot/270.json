    "question": "Mary buys 3 bags of M&Ms. The first bag has 300 M&Ms in it. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, and the third bag has a hole in it, so it only has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. How many M&Ms did Mary get total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary bought, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.\n\n1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.\n2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag. Therefore, the number of M&Ms in the second bag is:\n   \\[\n   300 + 12 = 312\n   \\]\n3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. Therefore, the number of M&Ms in the third bag is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{300}{2} = 150\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of M&Ms in all three bags:\n\\[\n300 + 312 + 150 = 762\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is \\(\\boxed{762}\\).",
    "answer": "First Bag:300\nSecond Bag:300+12=<<300+12=312>>312\nThird Bag:300/2=<<300/2=150>>150\nTotal number of M&M's: 300+312+150=<<300+312+150=762>>762 M&M's\n#### 762"
