    "question": "A stickler for health, Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. By contract, Octavia\u2019s husband Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks. Juan\u2019s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. By how many cups must Juan reduce his daily coffee intake?",
    "completion": "To determine by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Juan's current daily coffee consumption:**\n   - Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks.\n   - Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee.\n   - Therefore, Juan drinks \\( 10 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 5 \\) cups of coffee per day.\n\n2. **Determine the recommended daily coffee consumption:**\n   - The recommended daily coffee consumption is 4 cups.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference between Juan's current consumption and the recommended consumption:**\n   - Juan's current consumption is 5 cups.\n   - The recommended consumption is 4 cups.\n   - The difference is \\( 5 - 4 = 1 \\) cup.\n\nThus, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by \\(\\boxed{1}\\) cup.",
    "answer": "Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups of coffee, Octavia drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups\nJuan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which translates to 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cups\nSubtracting the daily recommended amount from Juan\u2019s current coffee intake gives 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups\nJuan must therefore reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups\n#### 16"
