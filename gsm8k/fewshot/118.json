    "question": "A customs officer at the main port of SeaSide clearances counted 2 containers of imported vehicles, each having 5 vehicles inside. The next day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Calculate the number of containers that were imported on the second day, assuming all the containers contain 5 vehicles.",
    "completion": "To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of vehicles imported on the first day.\n2. Determine the number of vehicles imported on the second day based on the total number of vehicles and the number of vehicles per container.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of vehicles imported on the first day. The first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles imported on the first day is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ containers} \\times 5 \\text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \\text{ vehicles} \\]\n\nNext, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port on the second day is 30. Since all the containers contain 5 vehicles, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:\n\\[ \\frac{30 \\text{ vehicles}}{5 \\text{ vehicles per container}} = 6 \\text{ containers} \\]\n\nThus, the number of containers imported on the second day is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]",
    "answer": "On the first day, 2*5 = <<2*5=10>>10 vehicles were Imported,\nOn the next day, the number of vehicles imported through the port is 30-10 = <<30-10=20>>20 vehicles\nIf each container has 5 vehicles, the number is 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 containers.\n#### 4"
