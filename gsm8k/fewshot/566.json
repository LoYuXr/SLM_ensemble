    "question": "Shiloh is 44 years old today.  In 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew.  How old is his nephew today?",
    "completion": "To determine the current age of Shiloh's nephew, we can set up an equation based on the information given.\n\nLet's denote the current age of Shiloh's nephew as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\n\\[ 44 + 7 = 3(x + 7) \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ \\frac{51}{3} = x + 7 \\]\n\n\\[ 17 = x + 7 \\]\n\nThen, subtract 7 from both sides to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 17 - 7 = x \\]\n\n\\[ x = 10 \\]\n\nSo, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.",
    "answer": "In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = <<44+7=51>>51 years old.\nIn 7 years, his nephew will be 51 / 3 = <<51/3=17>>17 years old.\nToday, his nephew is 17 - 7 = <<17-7=10>>10 years old.\n#### 10"
