    "question": "Mary and John got married last weekend.  There were 20 private cars and 12 buses parked outside the church.  After the ceremony, each bus carried 35 people and each car carried 3 people. How many people were inside the church?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people carried by the buses and the number of people carried by the cars, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of people carried by the buses:\n- There were 12 buses parked outside the church.\n- Each bus carried 35 people.\nSo, the total number of people carried by the buses is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ buses} \\times 35 \\text{ people/bus} = 420 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of people carried by the cars:\n- There were 20 private cars parked outside the church.\n- Each car carried 3 people.\nSo, the total number of people carried by the cars is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ cars} \\times 3 \\text{ people/car} = 60 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the number of people carried by the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:\n\\[ 420 \\text{ people} + 60 \\text{ people} = 480 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of people inside the church is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{480}\n\\]",
    "answer": "There were 20 private cars * 3 people = <<20*3=60>>60 people.\nThere were 12 buses * 35 people = <<12*35=420>>420 people.\nTotal inside the church was 60 people + 420 people = <<60+420=480>>480 people.\n#### 480"
