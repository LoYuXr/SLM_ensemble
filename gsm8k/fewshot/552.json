    "question": "A marketing company pays its employees on a commission-based salary system. If you sell goods worth $1000, you earn a 30% commission. Sales over $1000 get you an additional 10% commission. Calculate the amount of money Antonella earned if she sold goods worth $2500.",
    "completion": "To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to consider both the base commission and the additional commission for sales over $1000. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Base Commission:**\n   Antonella earns a 30% commission on the $1000 she sold.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Base Commission} = 0.30 \\times 1000 = 300\n   \\]\n\n2. **Additional Commission:**\n   For sales over $1000, Antonella earns an additional 10% commission on the $2500 she sold.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional Commission} = 0.10 \\times 2500 = 250\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Commission:**\n   To find the total commission, we add the base commission and the additional commission.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Commission} = 300 + 250 = 550\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Antonella earned a total of $550.",
    "answer": "Since Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, she got the first 30% commission, which is 30/100*$1000 = $<<30/100*1000=300>>300\nSince goods worth over $1000 earn you a 10% commission, she was entitled to earn an additional 10% commission per $500 on $2500-$1000 = $1500 worth of goods.\nThis amounts to $1500 * 10% = $<<1500*10*.01=150>>150\nIn total, Antonella earned $300 from the first commission and $150 from the second commission for a total of $150 + $300 = $<<300+150=450>>450\n#### 450"
