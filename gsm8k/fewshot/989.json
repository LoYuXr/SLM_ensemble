    "question": "Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute and saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and cook 90 shrimp?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate her total work rate and then use that to find the time required.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Emily's work rate:\n- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.\n- Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.\n\nThe total work rate is the sum of the work rates for peeling and sauteing:\n\\[ \\text{Total work rate} = 6 \\text{ shrimp/minute} + 30 \\text{ shrimp/minute} = 36 \\text{ shrimp/minute} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it will take her to peel and cook 90 shrimp. We can use the total work rate to find the time required:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of shrimp}}{\\text{Total work rate}} = \\frac{90 \\text{ shrimp}}{36 \\text{ shrimp/minute}} \\]\n\nNow, we perform the division:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{90}{36} = 2.5 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Emily \\boxed{2.5} minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.",
    "answer": "First find how long it takes Emily to peel the shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes\nThen find how many batches of shrimp she needs to cook: 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp/batch = <<90/30=3>>3 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 3 batches * 10 minutes/batch = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Emily spends: 30 minutes + 15 minutes = <<30+15=45>>45 minutes\n#### 45"
