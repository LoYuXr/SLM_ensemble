    "question": "Maggie's oven is malfunctioning. When she sets it to 450 the actual temperature is 468. If it's off by the same percentage for any recipe, what temperature should she set it at if her recipe calls for 520 degrees?",
    "completion": "To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we need to calculate the percentage deviation from the desired temperature of 520 degrees. The actual temperature of 468 degrees is 468 degrees below the desired temperature.\n\nFirst, we calculate the percentage deviation:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage deviation} = \\left( \\frac{468 - 520}{520} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage deviation} = \\left( \\frac{-52}{520} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage deviation} = -10\\%\n\\]\n\nA negative percentage deviation means the actual temperature is 10 degrees below the desired temperature. Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 450 degrees minus 10 degrees, which is 440 degrees.\n\nSo, the temperature Maggie should set her oven at is \\boxed{440}.",
    "answer": "The oven off by 18 degrees because 468 - 450 = <<468-450=18>>18\nThe oven is off by 4% because 18 / 450 x 100 = <<18/450*100=4>>4%\nTherefore X + .04X = 520\nTherefore 1.04X = 520\nThe temperature to set it is 500 because 520 / 1.04 = <<520/1.04=500>>500\n#### 500"
