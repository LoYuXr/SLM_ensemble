    "question": "In the first half of a soccer match, team A scores 4 goals while team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A. In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. What's the total number of goals scored in the match?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves of the game and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the goals scored by team B in the first half:\nTeam A scored 4 goals in the first half.\nTeam B scored 2 goals fewer than team A, so:\n\\[ \\text{Goals scored by team B in the first half} = 4 - 2 = 2 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the goals scored by team B in the second half:\nTeam B scored \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the number of goals scored by team A in the second half.\n\\[ \\text{Goals scored by team B in the second half} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 2 = 0.5 \\]\nSince the number of goals scored must be a whole number, we assume the problem implies the second half is scored as 0.5 goals, which is not possible in a real match but we will proceed with the given information.\n\nNow, let's calculate the goals scored by team A in the second half:\nTeam A scored \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half.\n\\[ \\text{Goals scored by team A in the second half} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 0.5 = 0.125 \\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by both teams in the match:\n\\[ \\text{Total goals scored} = \\text{Goals scored by team A in the first half} + \\text{Goals scored by team A in the second half} + \\text{Goals scored by team B in the first half} + \\text{Goals scored by team B in the second half} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total goals scored} = 4 + 0.125 + 2 + 0.5 = 6.625 \\]\n\nSince the problem implies the total number of goals scored is a whole number, we can conclude that the total number of goals scored in the match is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6.625} \\]",
    "answer": "In the first half, team B scores 4 goals - 2 goals = <<4-2=2>>2 goals.\nThe total number of goals scored in the first half is 2 goals + 4 goals = <<2+4=6>>6 goals\nDuring the second half, team B scores 4 goals * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 goals.\nTeam A 1/4 * 8 goals = <<1/4*8=2>>2 goals in the second half.\nThe total number of goals in the second half is 8 goals + 2 goals = <<8+2=10>>10 goals\nThe total number of goals in the match is 6 goals + 10 goals = <<6+10=16>>16 goals\n#### 16"
