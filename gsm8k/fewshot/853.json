    "question": "There are 90 rooms at the KozyInn Motel. It takes housekeeping 20 minutes to clean each room. How many hours would it take to clean one-half of the rooms?",
    "completion": "To determine how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of rooms at the motel.\n2. Determine the number of rooms to be cleaned.\n3. Calculate the time required to clean one-half of the rooms.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 90 rooms at the motel.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many rooms are to be cleaned. Since we are cleaning one-half of the rooms, we calculate:\n\\[ \\text{Number of rooms to be cleaned} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45 \\]\n\nNow, we know that it takes housekeeping 20 minutes to clean each room. To find out how many hours it would take to clean 45 rooms, we use the following calculation:\n\\[ \\text{Time in minutes} = 45 \\times 20 = 900 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the time from minutes to hours:\n\\[ \\text{Time in hours} = \\frac{900}{60} = 15 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, it would take \\(\\boxed{15}\\) hours to clean one-half of the rooms.",
    "answer": "90 * 20 = <<90*20=1800>>1800 minutes\n1800/2 = <<1800/2=900>>900 minutes\n900 minutes = <<900/60=15>>15 hours\nIt would take 15 hours to clean 45 rooms at the KozyInn Motel.\n#### 15"
