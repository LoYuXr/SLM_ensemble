    "question": "A cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. A dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes. Calculate the average time the two take the eat the sausages.",
    "completion": "To determine the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the time it takes for the cat to eat the sausages:**\n   The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes for the cat to eat the sausages is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for cat} = \\frac{30 \\text{ minutes}}{9 \\text{ sausages}} = \\frac{10}{3} \\text{ minutes per sausage}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages:**\n   The dog can eat the same number of sausages in \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) the amount of time it takes the cat. So, the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for dog} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{10}{3} \\text{ minutes per sausage} = \\frac{20}{9} \\text{ minutes per sausage}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages:**\n   To find the average time, we add the time it takes for the cat and the time it takes for the dog, and then divide by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average time} = \\frac{\\frac{10}{3} + \\frac{20}{9}}{2}\n   \\]\n   To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 9 is 9. So, we convert \\(\\frac{10}{3}\\) to a fraction with a denominator of 9:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{10 \\times 3}{3 \\times 3} = \\frac{30}{9}\n   \\]\n   Now we can add the fractions:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{30}{9} + \\frac{20}{9} = \\frac{50}{9}\n   \\]\n   Then we divide by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average time} = \\frac{\\frac{50}{9}}{2} = \\frac{5",
    "answer": "If the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, the dog takes 2/3*30 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 minutes.\nThe total amount of time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.\nThe average time in minutes that the two take to eat the sausages is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.\n#### 25"
