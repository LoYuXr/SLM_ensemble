    "question": "Each person in a certain household consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal. Supposing 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, how many weeks will a 42 kg bag of rice last?",
    "completion": "To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.\n2. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last based on the weekly consumption.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household. Since each of the 5 members eats 0.2 kg of rice every meal, the total weekly consumption is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ members} \\times 0.2 \\text{ kg/member} = 1 \\text{ kg/week} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:\n\\[ \\frac{42 \\text{ kg}}{1 \\text{ kg/week}} = 42 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nTherefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \\(\\boxed{42}\\) weeks.",
    "answer": "Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.\nSo, the 5 members consume 0.4 kg/day/person x 5 people = <<0.4*5=2>>2 kg of rice per day.\nIn a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.\nThus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.\n#### 3"
