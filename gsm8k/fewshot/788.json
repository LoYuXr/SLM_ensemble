    "question": "John is raising money for a school trip. He has applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover half the cost of the trip. How much money is John missing if he has $50 and the trip costs $300?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the trip.\n2. Determine the amount of money the school will cover.\n3. Find out how much John needs to contribute.\n4. Calculate the difference between what John needs to contribute and what he has.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the trip. The trip costs $300, and the school will cover half of this cost:\n\\[\n\\text{School's contribution} = \\frac{300}{2} = 150\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that John has $50. To find out how much more money John needs to contribute, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost of the trip:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount John needs to contribute} = 300 - 50 = 250\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much John is missing. Since the school will cover half of the trip cost, John is missing half of the trip cost:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount John is missing} = \\frac{300}{2} = 150\n\\]\n\nTherefore, John is missing \\boxed{150} dollars.",
    "answer": "John's school has decided to pay 300 / 2 = $<<300/2=150>>150 for his trip.\nIn total John has covered 150 + 50 = $<<150+50=200>>200 for his trip\nTherefore, John needs 300 - 200 = $<<300-200=100>>100 more for the trip.\n#### 100"
