    "question": "John had a son James when he was 19.  James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years.  How old will John's youngest son, who was born when John was 32, be in 3 years?",
    "completion": "To determine how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine James's current age:**\n   - James is currently twice as old as his sister Dora.\n   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.\n   - Therefore, Dora's current age is \\(12 - 3 = 9\\) years old.\n   - Since James is twice as old as Dora, James's current age is \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\) years old.\n\n2. **Determine John's current age:**\n   - John was 32 years old when James was born.\n   - Since James is 18 years old now, John is \\(32 - 18 = 14\\) years old.\n\n3. **Calculate John's youngest son's current age:**\n   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.\n   - Therefore, John's youngest son is \\(32 - 1 = 31\\) years old.\n\n4. **Determine John's youngest son's age in 3 years:**\n   - John's youngest son is currently 31 years old.\n   - In 3 years, he will be \\(31 + 3 = 34\\) years old.\n\nThus, in 3 years, John's youngest son will be \\(\\boxed{34}\\) years old.",
    "answer": "Dora is 12-3=<<12-3=9>>9\nSo James is 9*2=<<9*2=18>>18 years old\nThat means John is 18+19=<<18+19=37>>37\nJohns youngest son is 37-32=<<37-32=5>>5 years old\nSo he will be 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 in 3 years\n#### 8"
