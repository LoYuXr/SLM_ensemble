    "question": "The elevator in Jack's building supports a maximum load of 700 kg. An adult weighs an average of 80 kg. If Jack rides the elevator with 8 other adults, by how much will they have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator?",
    "completion": "To determine by how much Jack and his 8 other adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total weight of the 8 adults:**\n   - Each adult weighs 80 kg.\n   - There are 8 adults.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight of adults} = 8 \\times 80 \\text{ kg} = 640 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add the weight of Jack and his 8 other adults:**\n   - Jack weighs 80 kg.\n   - There are 9 people in total (Jack and his 8 other adults).\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight of Jack and his 8 other adults} = 80 \\text{ kg} + 9 \\times 80 \\text{ kg} = 80 \\text{ kg} + 720 \\text{ kg} = 800 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compare the total weight to the maximum load of the elevator:**\n   - The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg.\n   - The total weight of the 8 adults and Jack is 800 kg.\n\n4. **Calculate the excess weight:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Excess weight} = \\text{Maximum load} - \\text{Total weight of adults and Jack}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Excess weight} = 700 \\text{ kg} - 800 \\text{ kg} = -100 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n\nSince the excess weight is negative, it means they have actually been less than the maximum load by 100 kg.\n\nTherefore, by the maximum load of the elevator, they will have exceeded the load by \\boxed{100 \\text{ kg}}.",
    "answer": "Jack and 8 other adults form a total of 8 adults + 1 adult = <<8+1=9>>9 adults.\nIn total, the 9 adults together weigh 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = <<9*80=720>>720 kg.\nThey have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 720 kg - 700 kg = <<720-700=20>>20 kg.\n#### 20"
