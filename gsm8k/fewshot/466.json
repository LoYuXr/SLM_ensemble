    "question": "Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. How much more did Kelly pay than Becky?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost for each of them and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost for Becky:\n- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.\n- The total cost for Becky is \\(20 \\times 45 = 900\\) cents.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost for Kelly:\n- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.\n- The total cost for Kelly is \\(20 \\times 50 = 1000\\) cents.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:\n- The difference in the total cost is \\(1000 - 900 = 100\\) cents.\n\nSince the discount is given in dollars, we need to convert the difference from cents to dollars. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:\n- \\(100\\) cents is equivalent to \\(1\\) dollar.\n\nTherefore, the amount more that Kelly paid than Becky is \\(\\boxed{1}\\) dollar.",
    "answer": "Before the discount, Becky would have paid 20 apples x $0.45/apple = $<<20*0.45=9>>9\nWith the discount, Becky paid $9 - $1 = $<<9-1=8>>8.\nBefore the discount Kelly would have paid 20 apples x $0.50/apple = $<<20*0.5=10>>10\nWith a 10 percent discount Kelly paid ($10 x 10)/100 = $<<(10*10)/100=1>>1 less\nIn total Kelly paid $10 - $1 = $<<10-1=9>>9.\nKelly paid $9 - $8 = $<<9-8=1>>1 more than Becky.\n#### 1"
