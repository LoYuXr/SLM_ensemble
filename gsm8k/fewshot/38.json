    "question": "John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs.  How fast does he run?",
    "completion": "To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide that distance by the number of days he runs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance John runs each day:\n- The first day he runs 3 hours.\n- The other two days he runs half as much as the first day, which is \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\) hours.\n\nNow, let's find the total distance he runs in a week:\n- The first day: 3 hours\n- The other two days: \\( 1.5 \\) hours/day \\(\\times 2\\) days = \\( 3 \\) hours/day \\(\\times 2\\) days = \\( 6 \\) hours\n\nAdding these together gives the total distance he runs in a week:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} + 6 \\text{ hours} = 9 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how fast he runs in miles per hour. Since he runs 9 hours in a week and 60 miles in that time, we can calculate his speed as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{9 \\text{ hours}}{60 \\text{ miles}} = 0.15 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, John runs at a speed of \\( 0.15 \\) miles per hour.",
    "answer": "He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.\nHe runs half of those so he runs 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 days.\nSo for two days, he runs 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours.\nSo in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.\nSo he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.\n#### 10"
