    "question": "Uncle Ben has four horses. Each horse can consume five pounds of oats per meal. He feeds his horses twice a day. If one bag contains 50-pounds of oats,  how many bags of oats does he need to fed his horses for five days?",
    "completion": "To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for one horse:**\n   Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and Uncle Ben feeds them twice a day.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily oats consumption for one horse} = 5 \\text{ pounds/meal} \\times 2 \\text{ meals/day} = 10 \\text{ pounds/day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for all four horses:**\n   Since there are four horses and each horse consumes 10 pounds of oats per day, the total daily consumption for all horses is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily oats consumption for all horses} = 10 \\text{ pounds/horse/day} \\times 4 \\text{ horses} = 40 \\text{ pounds/day}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total oats needed for five days:**\n   Since the horses consume 40 pounds of oats per day, the total oats needed for five days is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total oats needed for five days} = 40 \\text{ pounds/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 200 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of bags needed:**\n   Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find out how many bags are needed to get 200 pounds of oats, we divide the total oats needed by the amount of oats per bag:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bags needed} = \\frac{200 \\text{ pounds}}{50 \\text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \\text{ bags}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.",
    "answer": "The four horses can consume 4 x 5 pounds = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of oats per meal.\nThus, they can consume 2 x 20 pounds = <<2*20=40>>40 pounds of oats a day.\nSo, uncle Ben needs 5 x 40 pounds = <<5*40=200>>200 pounds of oats to fed his horses for five days.\nTherefore, uncle Ben needs 200/50 = <<200/50=4>>4 bags of oats.\n#### 4"
