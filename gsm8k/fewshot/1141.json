    "question": "If Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days and then increases it to 5 eggs a day for 30 days, how many dozens of eggs will Chester need for 60 days?",
    "completion": "To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60 days and then convert that into dozens.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ eggs/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 90 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ eggs/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 150 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of eggs consumed in both periods to find the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ eggs} + 150 \\text{ eggs} = 240 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nSince there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs into dozens:\n\\[ \\frac{240 \\text{ eggs}}{12 \\text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \\text{ dozens} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
    "answer": "He starts off eating 3 eggs a day for 30 days for a total of 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 eggs\nThen he increases it to 5 eggs a day for 30 days for a total of 5*30 = <<5*30=150>>150 eggs\nAll total he will eat 90+150 = <<90+150=240>>240 eggs\nThere are 12 eggs in 1 dozen and he will 240 eggs which is 240/12 = 20 dozen eggs\n#### 20"
