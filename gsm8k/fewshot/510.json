    "question": "For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. Today is December 31st. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?",
    "completion": "To determine Andy's daily calorie deficit to lose 30 lbs by his birthday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs:**\n   - Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound.\n   - To lose 30 lbs, he needs to burn \\( 3500 \\times 30 = 105000 \\) calories.\n\n2. **Determine the number of days Andy has until his birthday:**\n   - Andy's birthday is on December 31st.\n   - The current date is December 31st.\n   - Therefore, Andy has \\( 365 - 31 = 334 \\) days until his birthday.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn over these 334 days:**\n   - Total calories needed = 105000 calories.\n\n4. **Determine the daily calorie deficit:**\n   - Daily deficit = Total calories needed / Number of days\n   - Daily deficit = \\( \\frac{105000}{334} \\approx 319.02 \\) calories.\n\nTherefore, Andy needs to burn approximately 319.02 calories each day to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday.",
    "answer": "January, March, and May have 31 days, February has 28, and April and June have 30, and Andy's birthday is on the 19th day of July. So there are 3 * 31 days + 28 + 2 * 30 days + 19 days = 93 days + 28 + 60 days + 19 days = <<3*31+28+2*30+19=200>>200 days until Andy's birthday.\nHe wants to lose 30 lbs. At 3500 calories per pound, this is 30 * 3500 = <<30*3500=105000>>105,000 calories total,\nTo reach his goal, he will have to burn 105,000 calories / 200 days = <<105000/200=525>>525 calories per day more than he consumes.\n#### 525"
