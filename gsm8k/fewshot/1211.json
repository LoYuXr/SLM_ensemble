    "question": "For one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine 14 mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. How many mL of medicine would be in 8 doses?",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of the first medicine used in one dose.\n2. Calculate the amount of the second medicine used in one dose.\n3. Calculate the total amount of medicine used in one dose.\n4. Calculate the total amount of medicine used in 8 doses.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The amount of the first medicine used in one dose is 14 mL.\n2. The amount of the second medicine used in one dose is 3 times the amount of the first medicine, which is \\(3 \\times 14 = 42\\) mL.\n3. The total amount of medicine used in one dose is the sum of the amounts of the first and second medicines, which is \\(14 + 42 = 56\\) mL.\n4. The total amount of medicine used in 8 doses is the amount used in one dose multiplied by 8, which is \\(56 \\times 8 = 448\\) mL.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is \\(\\boxed{448}\\) mL.",
    "answer": "First medicine = <<14=14>>14 mL\nSecond medicine = 3 * 14 = <<3*14=42>>42 mL\nOne dose = 14 + 42 = <<14+42=56>>56 mL\nEight doses = 8 * 56 = <<8*56=448>>448 mL\nEight doses of Saanvi's medicine contained 448 mL of medicine.\n#### 448"
