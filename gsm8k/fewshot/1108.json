    "question": "My mom went to a gardening shop. She bought a set of pots for $19 and a sack of garden soil for $26. At checkout, she used a coupon for $7 off. How much money did my mom spend at the gardening shop?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the items before any discounts.\n2. Subtract the coupon value from the total cost to find the final amount spent.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the items before any discounts:\n- The cost of the pots is $19.\n- The cost of the sack of garden soil is $26.\n- Therefore, the total cost is $19 + $26 = $45.\n\nNext, we subtract the coupon value from the total cost:\n- The coupon value is $7.\n- So, the final amount spent is $45 - $7 = $38.\n\nThus, the amount of money your mom spent at the gardening shop is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",
    "answer": "The total cost of the pots and a sack of garden soil is $19 + $26 = $<<19+26=45>>45.\nSo, my mom spent $45 - $7 = $<<45-7=38>>38 at the gardening store.\n#### 38"
