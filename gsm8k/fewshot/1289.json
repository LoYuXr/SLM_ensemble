    "question": "Octavia wants to make a quilt for her sister. She is going to build it from small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with. A small t-shirt is 3 square feet of fabric. A medium one is 4 square feet. A large one is 6 square feet. If she uses 11 small shirts, 8 medium, and 6 large shirts, how many square feet is the quilt?",
    "completion": "To determine the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the area occupied by each type of t-shirt and then sum these areas.\n\n1. **Calculate the area of small t-shirts:**\n   - Each small t-shirt is 3 square feet.\n   - Octavia is using 11 small t-shirts.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of small t-shirts} = 11 \\times 3 = 33 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the area of medium t-shirts:**\n   - Each medium t-shirt is 4 square feet.\n   - Octavia is using 8 medium t-shirts.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of medium t-shirts} = 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the area of large t-shirts:**\n   - Each large t-shirt is 6 square feet.\n   - Octavia is using 6 large t-shirts.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of large t-shirts} = 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Sum the areas of all the t-shirts:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area} = \\text{Area of small t-shirts} + \\text{Area of medium t-shirts} + \\text{Area of large t-shirts}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area} = 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total square footage of the quilt is \\(\\boxed{101}\\) square feet.",
    "answer": "The quilt has 33 square feet from small shirts because 11 x 3 = <<11*3=33>>33\nThe quilt has 32 square feet from medium shirts because 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32\nThe quilt has 36 square feet from large shirts because 6 x 6 = <<6*6=36>>36\nThe quilt is 101 square feet because 33 + 32 + 36 = <<33+32+36=101>>101\n#### 101"
