    "question": "At a restaurant, Juice Box A is 4 dollars. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A. Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A. How much more is Juice box C than Juice Box B?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the price of Juice Box B.\n2. Calculate the price of Juice Box C.\n3. Find the difference between the price of Juice Box C and the price of Juice Box B.\n\nFirst, we know the price of Juice Box A is 4 dollars. Since Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, we can calculate the price of Juice Box B as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Price of Juice Box B} = \\text{Price of Juice Box A} + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we know the price of Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A. So, we can calculate the price of Juice Box C as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Price of Juice Box C} = \\text{Price of Juice Box A} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B. We do this by subtracting the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Price of Juice Box C} - \\text{Price of Juice Box B} = 11 - 9 = 2 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Juice Box C is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) dollars more than Juice Box B.",
    "answer": "Juice Box B is 4+5 = <<4+5=9>>9 dollars.\nJuice box C is 4+7 = <<4+7=11>>11 dollars.\nJuice box C is 11-9 = <<11-9=2>>2 dollars more than Juice box B.\n#### 2"
