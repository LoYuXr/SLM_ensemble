    "question": "Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. How many tubes of paint does Jasper have?",
    "completion": "To determine how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of tubes of blue paint Ben has.\n2. Use the information about the number of tubes of blue paint Ben has to find out how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has.\n3. Use the information about the number of tubes of yellow paint Ben has to find out how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has.\n4. Sum the tubes of blue and yellow paint to find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has in total.\n\nLet's start with the tubes of blue paint Ben has. Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint.\n\nNext, we know that Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben. Therefore, the number of tubes of blue paint Jasper has is:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\]\n\nNow, we know that Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Therefore, the number of tubes of yellow paint Jasper has is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\]\n\nTo find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has in total, we add the tubes of blue and yellow paint together:\n\\[ 2 + 12 = 14 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]",
    "answer": "Jasper has 4/2= <<4/2=2>>2 tubes of blue paint\nJasper has 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 tubes of yellow paint\nJasper has a total of 2+9 =<<2+9=11>>11 tubes of paint\n#### 11"
