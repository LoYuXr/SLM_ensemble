    "question": "James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. Each dog needs one toy. James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs, but there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of toys James needs, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial number of toys needed:**\n   - James has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs.\n   - Each dog needs one toy.\n   - Therefore, the total number of toys needed is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ toys/dog} \\times 4 \\text{ dogs} = 16 \\text{ toys}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of dogs after James came back:**\n   - Initially, there were 4 dogs.\n   - After James came back, there were 8 more dogs.\n   - Therefore, the total number of dogs now is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ dogs} + 8 \\text{ dogs} = 12 \\text{ dogs}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of toys needed after buying more:**\n   - James bought the toys for 12 dogs.\n   - Each dog needs one toy.\n   - Therefore, the total number of toys needed after buying more is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ toys}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of toys James bought:**\n   - James bought the toys for 12 dogs.\n   - He went back to see that there are twice as many dogs as when he left.\n   - Therefore, the number of dogs he had after buying more is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 12 \\text{ dogs} = 24 \\text{ dogs}\n     \\]\n   - The number of toys he bought is:\n     \\[\n     24 \\text{ dogs} \\times 1 \\text{ toy/dog} = 24 \\text{ toys}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of toys James needs:**\n   - The total number of toys needed is the sum of the toys he bought and the toys he had after buying more:\n     \\[\n     24 \\text{ toys} + 16 \\text{ toys} = 40 \\text{ toys}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of toys James needs is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
    "answer": "James has 4+8=<<4+8=12>>12 toys.\nThere were 12*2=<<12*2=24>>24 dogs.\nJames needed to buy 24-12=<<24-12=12>>12 more toys.\nThere are 36 total toys.\n36-3=<<36-3=33>>33 toys are now needed.\n#### 33"
