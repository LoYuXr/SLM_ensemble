    "question": "Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day from her parents. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each every day and saves the change in her piggy bank. How much money does she put in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Marisa spends on lollipops each day.\n2. Determine the total amount of money she saves over 5 days.\n3. Convert the total savings into the amount of money she puts in her piggy bank.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Marisa spends on lollipops each day. She buys 4 lollipops, each costing 25 cents. So, the total cost for the lollipops is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 25 = 100 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money she saves over 5 days. Since she saves the change in her piggy bank, the total amount of money she saves is the same as the total amount of money she spends, which is 100 cents.\n\nNow, we need to convert the total savings into the amount of money she puts in her piggy bank. Since 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar, the amount of money she puts in her piggy bank is:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ cents} = 1 \\text{ dollar} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",
    "answer": "If each lollipop costs 25 cents, 4 lollipops cost 4 * 25 cents = <<4*25=100>>100 cents\nSince 100 cents = $1 she spends $1 everyday.\nHer savings everyday is $5 - $1 = $<<5-1=4>>4\nIf she saves $4 every day for 5 days, she will have $4 * 5 = $<<4*5=20>>20\n#### 20"
