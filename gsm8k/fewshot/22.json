    "question": "Billy sells DVDs. He has 8 customers on Tuesday. His first 3 customers buy one DVD each.  His next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each.  His last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs. How many DVDs did Billy sell on Tuesday?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then sum them up.\n\n1. **First 3 customers:**\n   - Each of these 3 customers buys 1 DVD.\n   - Total DVDs sold to these customers: \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\).\n\n2. **Next 2 customers:**\n   - Each of these 2 customers buys 2 DVDs.\n   - Total DVDs sold to these customers: \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Last 3 customers:**\n   - Each of these 3 customers buys 0 DVDs.\n   - Total DVDs sold to these customers: \\(3 \\times 0 = 0\\).\n\nNow, we sum up the DVDs sold to all groups:\n\\[3 \\text{ (first 3 customers)} + 4 \\text{ (next 2 customers)} + 0 \\text{ (last 3 customers)} = 7\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
    "answer": "His first 3 customers buy 3 * 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 DVDs.\nHis next 2 buy 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 DVDs.\nHe sells a total of 3 + 4 + 0 = <<3+4+0=7>>7 DVDs.\n#### 7"
