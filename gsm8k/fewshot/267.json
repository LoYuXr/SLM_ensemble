    "question": "It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.  It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.  After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.  How much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken?",
    "completion": "To determine the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Time to heat up to 300 degrees:**\n   - It takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees.\n\n2. **Time to heat up to 400 degrees:**\n   - It takes 40% longer than 20 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.\n   - 40% of 20 minutes is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     0.40 \\times 20 = 8 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the time to heat up to 400 degrees is:\n     \\[\n     20 + 8 = 28 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Time to cook the chicken:**\n   - It takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat up the oil.\n   - The time to heat up the oil is 20 minutes.\n   - Therefore, the time to cook the chicken is:\n     \\[\n     20 - 5 = 15 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**\n   - The total time is the sum of the time to heat up the oil and the time to cook the chicken:\n     \\[\n     20 + 15 = 35 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is \\(\\boxed{35}\\) minutes.",
    "answer": "It takes 20*.4=8 more minutes to go from 300 to 400 degrees than from room temperature to 300\nSo it takes 20+8=<<20+8=28>>28 minutes to warm up\nSo the total warming time was 28+20=<<28+20=48>>48 minutes\nSo it took 48-5=<<48-5=43>>43 minutes to cook the chicken\nSo it took 48+43=<<48+43=91>>91 minutes to make the chicken.\n#### 91"
