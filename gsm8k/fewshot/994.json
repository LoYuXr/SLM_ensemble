    "question": "Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous are the three little wolves who live in the forest and howl at the moon every night. When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.  And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?",
    "completion": "To determine the combined length of time the three wolves' howls last, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum these durations.\n\n1. **Tobias's Howl:**\n   Tobias howls for 20 seconds.\n\n2. **Chikote's Howl:**\n   Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. Therefore, the duration of Chikote's howl is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 20 = 40 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Igneous's Howl:**\n   Igneous howls for as long as the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls. The combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls is:\n   \\[\n   20 + 40 = 60 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the duration of Igneous's howl is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Duration:**\n   To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls last, we sum the durations of their individual howls:\n   \\[\n   20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert to Minutes:**\n   Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 120 seconds to minutes by dividing by 60:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{120}{60} = 2 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the combined length of time the three wolves' howls last is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) minutes.",
    "answer": "Chikote howls for 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 seconds.\nIgneous howls for 20+40=<<20+40=60>>60 seconds.\nIn total, the combined length of time, in seconds, of the three wolves' howls is 20+40+60=<<20+40+60=120>>120 seconds.\nThus, the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 120/60=<<120/60=2>>2 minutes.\n#### 2"
