    "completion": "To determine the total cost for the family, we need to calculate the cost of the adult ticket, the child tickets, and the popcorns, and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. **Cost of an adult ticket:**\n   The cost of an adult ticket is $12.\n\n2. **Cost of a child ticket:**\n   The cost of a child ticket is $8.\n\n3. **Cost of the popcorns:**\n   The family buys 2 popcorns, and each popcorn costs $3.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of popcorns} = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total cost:**\n   Now, we sum the costs of the adult ticket, the child tickets, and the popcorns.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of adult ticket} + \\text{Cost of child tickets} + \\text{Cost of popcorns}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 12 + 8 + 6 = 26 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount they pay is \\(\\boxed{26}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Adult tickets cost 12*2=$<<12*2=24>>24\nPopcorns cost 2*3=$<<2*3=6>>6\nThey pay 24+8+6=$<<24+8+6=38>>38 in total.\n#### 38"
