    "question": "Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.  His laundry machine will only allow him to wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.  How many loads of laundry does he do in a year?",
    "completion": "To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a year.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of sheets Greg uses per week:\n- Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.\n- Therefore, the total number of sheets used per week is:\n  \\[\n  4 \\text{ sheets/twin bed} + 1 \\text{ sheet/bed} = 5 \\text{ sheets/week}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many sheets he uses per day:\n- There are 7 days in a week.\n- Therefore, the number of sheets used per day is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\text{ sheets/week} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 35 \\text{ sheets/day}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of sheets used per week:\n- Greg uses 35 sheets per day.\n- There are 52 weeks in a year.\n- Therefore, the number of sheets used per year is:\n  \\[\n  35 \\text{ sheets/day} \\times 52 \\text{ days/year} = 1820 \\text{ sheets/year}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year:\n- His laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.\n- Therefore, the number of loads of laundry per year is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1820 \\text{ sheets/year}}{2 \\text{ sheets/load}} = 910 \\text{ loads/year}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \\boxed{910}.",
    "answer": "He has to wash 4 twin size sheet sets each week and the machine will only let him do 2 sets at a time so he has to do 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 loads of twin size sheets\nHe does 2 loads of twin size sheets and 1 load for king size sheets every week for a total of 2+1 = <<2+1=3>>3 loads\nOver 52 weeks (1 year) he does 3 loads of laundry a week for a total of 52*3 = <<3*52=156>>156 loads of laundry\n#### 156"
