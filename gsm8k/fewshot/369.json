    "question": "44 seniors need to receive awards.  Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.  Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost per frame.  2 of the seniors will also receive pins that are $5.  1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each.  How much will be spent on the senior gifts?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses for each group of seniors and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Cost of Picture Frames:**\n   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.\n   - There are 44 seniors.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the picture frames is:\n     \\[\n     44 \\times 20 = 880 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Cost of Etched Logo Frames:**\n   - Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost.\n   - The cost of the etched logo for one picture frame is:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 0.20 = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the etched logo frames is:\n     \\[\n     44 \\times 4 = 176 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Cost of Pins:**\n   - 2 of the seniors will also receive pins that are $5 each.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the pins is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Cost of Cords:**\n   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each.\n   - The number of officers is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{44}{4} = 11 \\text{ seniors}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the cords is:\n     \\[\n     11 \\times 12 = 132 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nNow, we sum up all the costs:\n\\[\n880 + 176 + 10 + 132 = 1198 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1198}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The cost per picture frame is $20 * 1.20 = $<<20*1.20=24>>24.\nTotal cost for the senior's picture frames is 44 seniors * $24 = $<<44*24=1056>>1056.\nThe cost for pins will be 2 seniors * $5 = $<<2*5=10>>10.\nThe number of seniors receiving cords is 1/4 * 44 = <<1/4*44=11>>11 seniors.\nThe total cost of cords is 11 seniors * $12 = $<<11*12=132>>132.\nThe total cost of gifts for seniors is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $<<1056+10+132=1198>>1198.\n#### 1198"
