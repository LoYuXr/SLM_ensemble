    "question": "There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students to every teacher, how many teachers are there?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of boys:**\n   - We know there are 60 girls at the school.\n   - There are twice as many boys as girls.\n   - Therefore, the number of boys is \\( 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\).\n\n2. **Determine the total number of students:**\n   - We know there are 5 students for every teacher.\n   - Let \\( T \\) be the number of teachers.\n   - The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and the number of teachers.\n   - Therefore, the total number of students is \\( 120 + T \\).\n\n3. **Set up the equation:**\n   - Since the total number of students is 5 times the number of teachers, we can write:\n     \\[\n     120 + T = 5T\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( T \\):**\n   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \\( T \\):\n     \\[\n     120 = 5T - T\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     120 = 4T\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 4:\n     \\[\n     T = \\frac{120}{4}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     T = 30\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
    "answer": "There are twice as many boys as girls, so if there are 60 girls, there are 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 boys\nThere are 120 + 60 = <<120+60=180>>180 students in total\nIf there are 5 students to each teacher, then 180 students would need 180/5 = <<180/5=36>>36 teachers\n#### 36"
