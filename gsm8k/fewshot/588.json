    "question": "Jared is trying to increase his typing speed. He starts with 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons the next time he tests his typing speed it has increased to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, what will be the average of the three measurements?",
    "completion": "To determine the average of the three measurements, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the initial typing speed:**\n   Jared's initial typing speed is 47 words per minute (WPM).\n\n2. **Identify the final typing speed:**\n   After some lessons, his typing speed increased to 52 WPM.\n\n3. **Identify the increase in typing speed:**\n   The increase in typing speed is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   52 \\text{ WPM} - 47 \\text{ WPM} = 5 \\text{ WPM}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Identify the next increase in typing speed:**\n   After the increase in typing speed, he continues to increase his typing speed by 5 words each time.\n\n5. **Calculate the next increase in typing speed:**\n   The next increase in typing speed is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ WPM} + 5 \\text{ WPM} = 10 \\text{ WPM}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the average of the three measurements:**\n   The average is the sum of the three measurements divided by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average} = \\frac{47 \\text{ WPM} + 52 \\text{ WPM} + 10 \\text{ WPM}}{3}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Perform the addition and division:**\n   \\[\n   47 + 52 + 10 = 109\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{109}{3} \\approx 36.33\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average of the three measurements is approximately **36.33 WPM**.",
    "answer": "Jared types at 52 WPM and increases it by 5 WPM, 52 + 5 = <<52+5=57>>57 WPM.\nHis average over all his measured words-per-minute is 47 + 52 + 57 = <<47+52+57=156>>156.\nHis total is 156 / 3 typing speeds = <<156/3=52>>52 WPM as Jared's average typing speed.\n#### 52"
