    "question": "Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. He has twice as many chickens as cows. How many legs do the animals have, all together?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of legs on Farmer Brown's farm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( C \\) represent the number of cows.\n   - Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens \\( H \\) can be expressed as \\( H = 2C \\).\n\n2. **Set Up Equations:**\n   - The total number of animals is 60, so we can write:\n     \\[\n     C + H = 60\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( H = 2C \\) into the equation:\n     \\[\n     C + 2C = 60\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     3C = 60\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( C \\):**\n   - Divide both sides by 3:\n     \\[\n     C = 20\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Chickens and Cows:**\n   - Number of cows \\( C = 20 \\).\n   - Number of chickens \\( H = 2C = 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Number of Legs:**\n   - Chickens have 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from chickens is:\n     \\[\n     40 \\times 2 = 80\n     \\]\n   - Cows have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from cows is:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 4 = 80\n     \\]\n   - Add the legs from chickens and cows to get the total number of legs:\n     \\[\n     80 + 80 = 160\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs on Farmer Brown's farm is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",
    "answer": "There are 60*(2/3)=<<60*(2/3)=40>>40 chickens.\nThere are 60-40=<<60-40=20>>20 cows.\nThe chickens have 40*2=<<40*2=80>>80 legs.\nThe cows have 20*4=<<20*4=80>>80 legs.\nThey have 80+80=<<80+80=160>>160 legs altogether.\n#### 160"
