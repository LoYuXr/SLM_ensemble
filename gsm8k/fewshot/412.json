    "question": "Shannon makes her own madeleine cookies and eats 2 a night as a treat.  She wants to make enough cookies to last her for 30 days by storing them in the freezer. Her recipe makes 1 dozen madeleine cookies.  How many dozens of cookies will she need to make so she has enough for 30 days?",
    "completion": "To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make to last her 30 days, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cookies needed:**\n   Shannon wants to make enough cookies to last her for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, we need to find out how many cookies she will eat in 30 days.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cookies needed} = 2 \\text{ cookies/night} \\times 30 \\text{ nights} = 60 \\text{ cookies}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of dozens of cookies needed:**\n   Each dozen cookies contains 12 cookies. To find out how many dozens of cookies are needed, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per dozen.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of dozens needed} = \\frac{60 \\text{ cookies}}{12 \\text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \\text{ dozens}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Shannon will need to make \\boxed{5} dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days.",
    "answer": "She eats 2 cookies a night so for 30 nights she needs 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 cookies\nHer recipe makes 12 cookies and she needs to make 60 cookies so that's 60/12 = <<60/12=5>>5 dozen\n#### 5"
