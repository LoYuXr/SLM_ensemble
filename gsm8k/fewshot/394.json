    "question": "Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. How many books will she need to carry to complete her task?",
    "completion": "To determine how many books Wendy needs to place, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of books in the shelving system.\n2. Determine how many more books Wendy wants to place.\n3. Add the additional books to the total number of books in the system.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of books in the shelving system. The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more books Wendy wants to place. According to the problem, she wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the shelving system. So, we first calculate double the number of books:\n\\[ 2 \\times 36 = 72 \\]\nThen, we add 20 to this result:\n\\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of books Wendy needs to carry to complete her task is:\n\\[ \\boxed{92} \\]",
    "answer": "The capacity of the shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns is 6*6=<<6*6=36>>36 books.\nDouble the capacity of the shelving system is 2*36=<<2*36=72>>72\nIf Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns, she wants to place 20+72=92 books.\n#### 92"
