    "question": "Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food and 6 packages of dog food. Each package of cat food contained 11 tins, and each package of dog food contained 6 tins. How many more tins of cat food than dog food did Kimberly buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins of each type of food and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:\n- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.\n- Each package of cat food contains 11 tins.\n\\[\n8 \\text{ packages} \\times 11 \\text{ tins per package} = 88 \\text{ tins of cat food}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:\n- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.\n- Each package of dog food contains 6 tins.\n\\[\n6 \\text{ packages} \\times 6 \\text{ tins per package} = 36 \\text{ tins of dog food}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and the number of tins of dog food:\n\\[\n88 \\text{ tins of cat food} - 36 \\text{ tins of dog food} = 52 \\text{ tins of cat food}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Kimberly bought \\(\\boxed{52}\\) more tins of cat food than dog food.",
    "answer": "The number of cat food tins that Kimberley has bought is 8 \u00d7 11 = <<8*11=88>>88.\nWhilst the number of dog food tins she has bought is 6 \u00d7 6 = <<6*6=36>>36.\nThere are 88 - 36 = <<88-36=52>>52 more tins of cat food than dog food.\n#### 52"
