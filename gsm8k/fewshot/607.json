    "question": "The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.  The directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo and this will give you 120 washings.  If Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, how much will each pump cost, in cents?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost per pump of the shampoo, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of washings per pump:**\n   Jackie uses 1 pump per wash. The directions state that 2 pumps give 120 washings. Therefore, the number of washings per pump is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{120 \\text{ washings}}{2 \\text{ pumps}} = 60 \\text{ washings per pump}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the cost per pump:**\n   The total cost of the shampoo bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of washings per pump:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24.00 \\text{ dollars}}{60 \\text{ washings per pump}} = 0.40 \\text{ dollars per pump}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the cost per pump to cents:**\n   Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we convert $0.40 to cents:\n   \\[\n   0.40 \\text{ dollars} \\times 100 \\text{ cents per dollar} = 40 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost per pump of the shampoo is \\(\\boxed{40}\\) cents.",
    "answer": "2 pumps will give you 120 washes so if she only uses 1 pump per wash she doubles the number of washes so she now has 120*2 = <<120*2=240>>240 washes\nThe bottle costs $24.00 and she will 240 washes so each wash is 24/240 = $<<24/240=0.10>>0.10\n#### 10"
