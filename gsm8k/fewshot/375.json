    "question": "Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls for breakfast. After feeding her 6 children with one each, she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces and fed them to the chickens. How many pieces of rolls did she feed to the chickens?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pieces of bread Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bread rolls Mrs. Sherman made.\n2. Determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children.\n3. Calculate the total number of pieces of rolls that were broken into.\n\nFirst, we know that Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls. After feeding her 6 children, she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces. So, the number of rolls left is:\n\\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \\text{ rolls} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pieces of rolls were broken into. Since each of the 6 rolls was broken into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces broken into is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 8 = 48 \\text{ pieces} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of rolls that Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens is:\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]",
    "answer": "After feeding her children, Mrs. Sherman was left with 12 - 6 = <<12-6=6>>6 rolls\nShe fed 6 x 8 = <<6*8=48>>48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.\n#### 48"
