    "question": "Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week. He earns $10 per hour and gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Watson make in April if the company performed very well for the whole month?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Watson made in April if the company performed very well, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hours Watson works in April.\n2. Calculate the total earnings for the week.\n3. Calculate the total earnings for the month if the company performed very well.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Watson works in April.**\n\nApril has 30 days. Since Watson works 10 hours each day, the total number of hours he works in April is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 300 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total earnings for the week.**\n\nWatson earns $10 per hour. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ hours} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 3000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for the month if the company performed very well.**\n\nThe company performed very well for the whole month, so Watson earns a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total earnings for the month are:\n\\[ 3000 \\text{ dollars} + 300 \\text{ dollars} = 3300 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the total amount of money Watson made in April if the company performed very well is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3300} \\]",
    "answer": "In a day, Watson makes 10 * 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100\nIf he works five days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 5 * 4= <<5*4=20>>20 days.\nSince he makes $100 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 20 * 100= $<<20*100=2000>>2000.\nHe also got a 300 * 4 = $<<300*4=1200>>1200 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of April.\nAt the end of April, he earned 2000 +1200 = $<<2000+1200=3200>>3200.\n#### 3200"
