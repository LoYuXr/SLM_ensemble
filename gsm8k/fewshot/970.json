    "question": "Zeke's baseball team has 7 more players than Carlton's. If Carlton's team has 13 players, how many players are there in both teams combined?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of players in both teams combined, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of players in Carlton's team.\n2. Calculate the number of players in Zeke's team.\n3. Add the number of players in both teams together.\n\nFirst, we know that Carlton's team has 13 players. According to the problem, Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. Therefore, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of players in Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of players in both teams together:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of players} = \\text{Number of players in Carlton's team} + \\text{Number of players in Zeke's team} = 13 + 20 = 33 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of players in both teams combined is:\n\\[ \\boxed{33} \\]",
    "answer": "If Carlton's team has 13 players, Zeke's team has 7 players + 13 players = 20 players.\nIn total, the two teams have 20 players + 13 players = <<20+13=33>>33 players.\n#### 33"
