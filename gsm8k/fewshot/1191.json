    "question": "May is getting her hair cut and colored. It costs $40 for the color and $30 per inch of haircut. If her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8, how much did her cut and color cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to break down the costs step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total length of hair:**\n   - May's hair starts at 10 inches and ends at 8 inches.\n   - The total length of hair is \\( 10 + 8 = 18 \\) inches.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the color:**\n   - The color costs $30 per inch of hair.\n   - The total cost for the color is \\( 18 \\times 30 = 540 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the haircut:**\n   - The haircut costs $40 per inch of hair.\n   - The total cost for the haircut is \\( 18 \\times 40 = 720 \\) dollars.\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut.\n   - The total cost is \\( 540 + 720 = 1260 \\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of May's haircut and color is \\(\\boxed{1260}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "She had 2 inches cut because 10-8=<<10-8=2>>2\nIt cost $60 for the cut because 2 x 30 =<<2*30=60>>60\nIt cost $100 total because 40+60=<<40+60=100>>100\n#### 100"
