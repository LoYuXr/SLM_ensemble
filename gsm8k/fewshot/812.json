    "question": "Rose is out picking flowers for a vase she wants to fill.  She starts off by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial number of petals from the first set of flowers.\n2. Calculate the initial number of petals from the second set of flowers.\n3. Calculate the initial number of petals from the third set of flowers.\n4. Calculate the initial number of petals from the fourth set of flowers.\n5. Calculate the initial number of petals from the fifth set of flowers.\n6. Calculate the total number of petals from all the flowers initially.\n7. Subtract the number of petals that were dropped from the total number of petals.\n\nLet's start with the initial calculation:\n\n1. The first set of flowers has 3 flowers with 5 petals each:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 5 = 15 \\text{ petals}\n   \\]\n\n2. The second set of flowers has 4 flowers with 6 petals each:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 6 = 24 \\text{ petals}\n   \\]\n\n3. The third set of flowers has 5 flowers with 4 petals each:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 4 = 20 \\text{ petals}\n   \\]\n\n4. The fourth set of flowers has 6 flowers with 7 petals each:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 7 = 42 \\text{ petals}\n   \\]\n\n5. The fifth set of flowers has 6 flowers with 7 petals each, but 1 flower is dropped:\n   \\[\n   6 - 1 = 5 \\text{ petals}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's add up all the petals from the initial set:\n\\[\n15 + 24 + 20 + 42 + 5 = 106 \\text{ petals}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of petals that were dropped:\n\\[\n106 - 1 = 105 \\text{ petals}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{105}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.\nRose then picks 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 petals worth of the 6 petal flowers.\nRose then picks 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 petals worth of the 4 petal flowers.\nFinally, Rose picks 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 petals worth of the 7 petal flowers.\nRose carries 15+24+20+42=<<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals worth of flowers back to the vase.\nBut the wind blows 5+6+4+7=<<5+6+4+7=22>>22 petals worth of flowers away.\nSo Rose has 101-22=<<101-22=79>>79 petals worth remaining\n#### 79"
