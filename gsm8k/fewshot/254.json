    "question": "Shelly's 3 kids spent all day at the water park.  Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.  Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel and Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne.  How many times did Robert go down the water slide?",
    "completion": "To determine how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow the information given step by step.\n\n1. Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.\n2. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. This means Anne went down the slide 70% of what Mitchel did. Therefore, the number of times Anne went down the slide is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\times (1 - 0.30) = 30 \\times 0.70 = 21\n   \\]\n3. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Therefore, the number of times Robert went down the slide is:\n   \\[\n   21 \\times 4 = 84\n   \\]\n\nSo, Robert went down the water slide \\(\\boxed{84}\\) times.",
    "answer": "Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel who went down 30 times so that's .30*30 = <<30*.01*30=9>>9 times less\nMitchel went down 30 times and Anne went down 9 times less than him for a total of 30-9 = <<30-9=21>>21 times\nRobert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, who went down 21 times so Robert went down the slide 4*21 = <<4*21=84>>84 times\n#### 84"
