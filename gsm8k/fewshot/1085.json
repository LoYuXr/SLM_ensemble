    "question": "A crocodile grows 8 inches long in 4 years. At this rate, how many inches will it grow in 13 years?",
    "completion": "To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years at the current rate of 8 inches per year, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the current growth rate of the crocodile. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years.\n2. Calculate the number of years the crocodile will grow in 13 years. This is done by dividing 13 by the current growth rate of 8 inches per year:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{13}{8} = 1.625\n   \\]\n   This means the crocodile will grow 1.625 inches in 13 years.\n3. Since the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can find out how many times 8 inches fit into 1.625 inches:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1.625}{8} = 0.203125\n   \\]\n   This means the crocodile will grow 0.203125 times 8 inches in 13 years.\n4. To find the total growth in inches, we multiply 0.203125 by 8 inches:\n   \\[\n   0.203125 \\times 8 = 1.625\n   \\]\n   This confirms that the crocodile will grow 1.625 inches in 13 years.\n\nTherefore, the crocodile will grow \\boxed{1.625} inches in 13 years.",
    "answer": "Crocodile grows 8/4 = <<8/4=2>>2 inches a year.\nCrocodile grows 13*2 = <<13*2=26>>26 inches in 13 years.\n#### 26"
