    "question": "A salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. He sold 17 of them for $20 at a flash sale on Monday, and the rest were sold to a department store for $25 each throughout the rest of the week. How much money, in dollars, was the salesman's profit?",
    "completion": "To determine the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers.\n2. Subtract the cost of the sneakers from the total revenue to find the profit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers. The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each:\n\\[ 17 \\times 20 = 340 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the cost of the sneakers from the total revenue to find the profit:\n\\[ 340 - 576 = -236 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince the result is negative, it means the salesman actually spent more money than he earned. Therefore, the salesman's profit is:\n\\[ \\boxed{-236} \\]",
    "answer": "The salesman made 17 \u00d7 $20 = $<<17*20=340>>340 at the flash sale on Monday.\nThere were 48 - 17 = <<48-17=31>>31 sneakers left.\nAt the department store he made 31 \u00d7 $25 = $<<31*25=775>>775 throughout the week.\nIn total he made $340 + $775 = $<<340+775=1115>>1115.\nThe profit made by the salesman was $1115 - $576 = $<<1115-576=539>>539.\n#### 539"
