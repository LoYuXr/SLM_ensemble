    "question": "Paul needs 63 cupcakes for a birthday party happening on Saturday. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. How many more cupcakes should Paul buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of cupcakes he currently has. Paul already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. We can find the total number of cupcakes he currently has by adding these two quantities together:\n\n\\[ 8 + 40 = 48 \\]\n\nPaul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. To find out how many more cupcakes he needs to buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:\n\n\\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, Paul needs to buy \\(\\boxed{15}\\) more cupcakes.",
    "answer": "The total number of chocolate and toffee cupcakes is 8 + 40 = <<8+40=48>>48.\nPaul should buy 63 \u2212 48 = <<63-48=15>>15 more cupcakes.\n#### 15"
