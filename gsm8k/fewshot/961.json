    "question": "Amora, Lainey, and Collins wanted to share corn chips equally but then realized only two people would get an equal amount of corn chips, while the other person would receive 15 more corn chips than the number the others got. If Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, how many corn chips were there altogether?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of corn chips, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.\n\nLet:\n- \\( A \\) be the number of corn chips Amora got.\n- \\( L \\) be the number of corn chips Lainey got.\n- \\( C \\) be the number of corn chips Collins got.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so:\n   \\[\n   A + L = 70\n   \\]\n2. The total number of corn chips is 15 more than the number the others got, so:\n   \\[\n   A + L + C = 15\n   \\]\n\nWe also know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips each person got:\n\\[\nA + L + C = 15\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n1. \\( A + L = 70 \\)\n2. \\( A + L + C = 15 \\)\n\nWe can substitute the value of \\( A + L \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[\n70 + C = 15\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( C \\):\n\\[\nC = 15 - 70\n\\]\n\\[\nC = -55\n\\]\n\nThis result indicates that there is a contradiction because the total number of corn chips cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement and the equations.\n\nGiven the problem constraints, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. Let's reframe the problem to ensure it is solvable with the given constraints.\n\nIf we assume the problem meant to say that the total number of corn chips is 15 more than the number the others got, and we need to find the total number of corn chips, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Let \\( A \\) be the number of corn chips Amora got.\n2. Let \\( L \\) be the number of corn chips Lainey got.\n3. Let \\( C \\) be the number of corn chips Collins got.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. \\( A + L = 70 \\)\n2. \\( A + L + C = 15 \\)\n\nWe can solve these equations step-by-step.\n\nFirst, subtract the first equation from the second:\n\\[\n(A + L + C) - (",
    "answer": "If Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, they received a total of 70*2 = <<70*2=140>>140 corn chips.\nCollins received 70+15 = <<70+15=85>>85 corn chips.\nAltogether, there were 85+140 = <<85+140=225>>225 corn chips.\n#### 225"
