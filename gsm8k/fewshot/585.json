    "question": "Tabitha agreed to pay John and Jill $10 an hour to help clean out her attic and basement.  Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday.  John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday.  How much more money did John earn compared to Jill?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate the total earnings for both individuals and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Jill's total earnings:\n- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday.\n- Jill's total hours worked = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.\n\nNext, let's calculate John's total earnings:\n- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours.\n- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 1 * 3 = 3 hours.\n- John's total hours worked = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.\n\nNow, we calculate the total earnings for both individuals:\n- Jill's total earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.\n- John's total earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.\n\nFinally, we find the difference in earnings between John and Jill:\n- Difference in earnings = John's total earnings - Jill's total earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.\n\nTherefore, John earned $40 more than Jill.",
    "answer": "Jill worked 2 hours + 1 hour for a total of 3 hours.\nJill worked 3 hours at $10/hour so she made 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30\nJohn worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday so 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours\nJohn worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday so 3*1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours\nJohn worked 4 hours + 3 hours for 7 hours\nJohn worked 7 hours at $10/hour so he made 7*10 = $<<7*10=70>>70\nJohn made $70 while Jill made $30 so $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 more dollars\n#### 40"
