    "question": "The zookeeper feeds all the apes in the zoo. He orders all the bananas from a local farm every 2 months. If the monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas every month, how many bananas does he need to order to last for 2 months?",
    "completion": "To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required for all the apes in the zoo over 2 months. We know the number of bananas needed by each type of ape and the number of months between orders.\n\n1. The monkeys need 200 bananas per month.\n2. The gorillas need 400 bananas per month.\n3. The baboons need 100 bananas per month.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of bananas needed for the monkeys over 2 months:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ bananas/month} \\times 2 \\text{ months} = 400 \\text{ bananas} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of bananas needed for the gorillas over 2 months:\n\\[ 400 \\text{ bananas/month} \\times 2 \\text{ months} = 800 \\text{ bananas} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total number of bananas needed for the baboons over 2 months:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ bananas/month} \\times 2 \\text{ months} = 200 \\text{ bananas} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the bananas needed for all three types of apes to find the total number of bananas required for 2 months:\n\\[ 400 \\text{ bananas} + 800 \\text{ bananas} + 200 \\text{ bananas} = 1400 \\text{ bananas} \\]\n\nTherefore, the zookeeper needs to order \\boxed{1400} bananas to last for 2 months.",
    "answer": "The total number of bananas the prime apes need every month is 200+400+100= <<200+400+100=700>>700.\nTherefore in 2 months, the total number of bananas they need is 700x2= <<700*2=1400>>1400.\n#### 1400"
