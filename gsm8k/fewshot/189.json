    "question": "Three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. They also went on 2 different rides which costs $33 for each ride. If they agreed to split all the costs evenly, how much did each of them pay?",
    "completion": "To determine how much each friend paid, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the tickets:**\n   The total amount spent on tickets is $20.25. Since they bought 3 tickets, the cost of the tickets is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 20.25 = 60.75\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the food:**\n   The cost of food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets. Therefore, the cost of the food is:\n   \\[\n   60.75 - 4.50 = 56.25\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the rides:**\n   The cost of each ride is $33. Since they went on 2 rides, the total cost of the rides is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 33 = 66\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of all the expenses:**\n   The total cost of all the expenses is the sum of the cost of the tickets, the cost of the food, and the cost of the rides:\n   \\[\n   60.75 + 56.25 + 66 = 183\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the cost per person:**\n   The total amount spent is shared among 3 friends, so each person's share is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{183}{3} = 61\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each friend paid \\(\\boxed{61}\\).",
    "answer": "They spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $<<20.25-4.5=15.75>>15.75 on food.\nThey spent $33 x 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66 for the rides.\nThey spent a total of $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.\nSo each of them paid $102/3 = $<<102/3=34>>34.\n#### 34"
