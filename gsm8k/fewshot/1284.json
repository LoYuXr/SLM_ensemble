    "question": "An ice cream truck is traveling through a neighborhood. Children from various homes have started chasing the truck and, by the time the truck has reached the end of the first street, there are 5 children it. On the second street, each child is joined by another child and on the third street, each child in the existing group is joined by another 2 children. The original 5 children then give up and leave the group. How many children are now following the truck?",
    "completion": "To determine how many children are now following the ice cream truck, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The ice cream truck starts at the beginning of the first street.\n   - There are 5 children following the truck.\n\n2. **First Street:**\n   - Each child on the first street is joined by another child.\n   - This means the truck now has 6 children (5 original + 1 new child).\n\n3. **Second Street:**\n   - Each child on the second street is joined by another child.\n   - This means the truck now has 7 children (6 original + 1 new child).\n\n4. **Third Street:**\n   - Each child in the existing group (6 children) is joined by another 2 children.\n   - This means the truck now has 9 children (6 original + 2 new children).\n\n5. **Fourth Street:**\n   - Each child in the existing group (6 children) is joined by another 2 children.\n   - This means the truck now has 11 children (6 original + 2 new children).\n\n6. **Fifth Street:**\n   - Each child in the existing group (6 children) is joined by another 2 children.\n   - This means the truck now has 13 children (6 original + 2 new children).\n\nTherefore, after the truck has traveled through all the streets, the number of children now following the truck is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",
    "answer": "On the second street, each child is joined by another child so the group doubles to 5 children * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 children.\n\nOn the third street, each child is joined by 2 more so the group has tripled to 10 children * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 children.\nAfter the initial children leave, the group now has 30 children \u2013 5 original children = <<30-5=25>>25 children.\n#### 25"
