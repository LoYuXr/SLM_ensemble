    "question": "Jasmine's teacher gives stickers for reward. She was given 15 stickers for participating in class, but she lost 7 stickers during playtime. However, her teacher gave her another 5 stickers for helping her classmates. How many stickers does she have at the end?",
    "completion": "To determine how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of stickers Jasmine received.\n2. Subtract the number of stickers she lost during playtime.\n3. Add the number of stickers her teacher gave her for helping her classmates.\n\nLet's go through the calculations step by step:\n\n1. Initial number of stickers: 15\n2. Stickers lost during playtime: 7\n   \\[\n   15 - 7 = 8\n   \\]\n   So, after losing 7 stickers, Jasmine has 8 stickers left.\n3. Stickers given by the teacher for helping her classmates: 5\n   \\[\n   8 + 5 = 13\n   \\]\n   So, after receiving 5 stickers, Jasmine has 13 stickers in total.\n\nTherefore, the number of stickers Jasmine has at the end is \\boxed{13}.",
    "answer": "Jasmine had 15 stickers - 7 stickers = <<15-7=8>>8 stickers after losing 7.\nThen, she now has 8 stickers + 5 stickers = <<8+5=13>>13 stickers at the end.\n#### 13"
