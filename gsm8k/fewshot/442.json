    "question": "When Marcus wakes up, his house is 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the oven is on it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees. Then Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. What is the house's final temperature?",
    "completion": "To determine the house's final temperature, we need to account for the temperature changes over time. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Temperature**: Marcus's house is initially at 40 degrees.\n\n2. **Temperature Increase Due to Baking**: The oven is on for 3 hours, and each hour it is on raises the temperature by 5 degrees.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Temperature increase due to baking} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\times 5 \\text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n   So, the temperature after baking is:\n   \\[\n   40 \\text{ degrees} + 15 \\text{ degrees} = 55 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Temperature Decrease Due to Opening the Window**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Temperature decrease due to window opening} = \\left(\\frac{30 \\text{ minutes}}{10 \\text{ minutes/window}}\\right) \\times 2 \\text{ degrees} = 3 \\text{ windows} \\times 2 \\text{ degrees/window} = 6 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n   So, the temperature after the window is open is:\n   \\[\n   55 \\text{ degrees} - 6 \\text{ degrees} = 49 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the house's final temperature is \\(\\boxed{49}\\) degrees.",
    "answer": "First find the total temperature increase from the oven: 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees\nThen add that amount to the starting temperature: 15 degrees + 40 degrees = <<15+40=55>>55 degrees\nThen divide the time the window is open by 10 minutes to find how many 2-degree temperature decreases there are: 30 minutes / 10 minutes = <<30/10=3>>3\nThen multiply the number of decreases by the amount of each decrease: 3 * 2 degrees = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees\nThen subtract that amount from the house's temperature after baking to find the final temperature: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = <<55-6=49>>49 degrees\n#### 49"
