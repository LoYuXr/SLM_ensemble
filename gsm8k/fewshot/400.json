    "question": "A glass of milk is 8 ounces of milk.  John drinks 2 glasses of milk.  If milk has 3 calories per ounce how many calories did he consume?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of calories John consumed, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of milk John drinks.\n2. Determine the total calories from the milk he drinks.\n\nFirst, we know that John drinks 2 glasses of milk. Since each glass contains 8 ounces of milk, the total amount of milk he drinks is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ glasses} \\times 8 \\text{ ounces per glass} = 16 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nNext, we know that each ounce of milk contains 3 calories. Therefore, the total number of calories from the 16 ounces of milk is:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ ounces} \\times 3 \\text{ calories per ounce} = 48 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nSo, the total number of calories John consumed is:\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]",
    "answer": "He drank 8*2=<<8*2=16>>16 ounces of milk\nSo he drank 16*3=<<16*3=48>>48 calories of milk\n#### 48"
