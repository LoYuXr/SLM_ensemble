    "question": "John decides to take a cooking class.  The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time for 6 weeks.  If he learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, how many recipes does he learn?",
    "completion": "To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends in class each week.\n2. Determine how many hours John spends in class over the 6 weeks.\n3. Calculate how many recipes John learns based on the number of hours spent in class.\n\nFirst, we know that the class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. Therefore, the total number of hours John spends in class each week is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ times/week} \\times 2 \\text{ hours/time} = 8 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours John spends in class over the 6 weeks. Since he spends 8 hours each week, over 6 weeks he spends:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 6 \\text{ weeks} = 48 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nJohn learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. Therefore, the number of recipes he learns is:\n\\[ \\frac{48 \\text{ hours}}{1.5 \\text{ hours/reciprice}} = 32 \\text{ recipes} \\]\n\nSo, the total number of recipes John learns is:\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]",
    "answer": "He is in class for 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 hours per week\nSo he takes classes for 8*6=<<8*6=48>>48 hours\nThat means he learned 48/1.5=<<48/1.5=32>>32 recipes\n#### 32"
