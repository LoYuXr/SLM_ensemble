    "question": "A hotel in the Philippines charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay or 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. After 12 hours, visitors have the option to add 70 pesos for every additional hour. Cameron arrives at 5 pm at the hotel and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Cameron would save by choosing the option to add 70 pesos for every additional hour after 12 hours, we need to calculate the total cost for both scenarios and then find the difference.\n\n### Scenario 1: 12-hour stay\n- Cost for 12 hours: 1600 pesos\n- Cost for 13 hours: 1600 pesos + 70 pesos = 1670 pesos\n\n### Scenario 2: 24-hour stay\n- Cost for 24 hours: 1600 pesos\n\n### Cost Calculation\n1. **12-hour stay:**\n   - Cost: 1600 pesos\n\n2. **24-hour stay:**\n   - Cost: 1600 pesos\n\n3. **13-hour stay (additional 70 pesos):**\n   - Cost: 1600 pesos + 70 pesos = 1670 pesos\n\n### Total Cost for Both Options\n- Total cost for 12-hour stay: 1600 pesos\n- Total cost for 24-hour stay: 1600 pesos\n- Total cost for 13-hour stay: 1670 pesos\n\n### Savings Calculation\n- Savings: Total cost for 12-hour stay - Total cost for 24-hour stay\n- Savings: 1600 pesos - 1600 pesos = 0 pesos\n\n### Conclusion\nCameron would save 0 pesos by choosing the option to add 70 pesos for every additional hour after 12 hours.",
    "answer": "12 hours after 5 pm is 5 am.\nIf Cameron wants to leave at 10 am, he must pay for an additional 10 am - 5 am = <<10-5=5>>5 hours.\nThis means that he must pay an additional 70 pesos x 5 hours = <<70*5=350>>350 pesos.\nAltogether, he must pay 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = <<1000+350=1350>>1350 pesos.\nTherefore, he will save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = <<1600-1350=250>>250 pesos.\n#### 250"
