    "question": "Amalia, Megan, and Dior divided the home chores so that each person had something to do while the others were working. Amalia's work was to mow the lawn, which took her 4 hours. Megan had to walk the dog and this took her 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore. Dior's work was to do laundry and she took well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn. Calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether.",
    "completion": "To calculate the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we need to determine the time each person took to complete their respective chores and then sum these times.\n\n1. **Amalia's chores:**\n   - Amalia's work was to mow the lawn.\n   - It took her 4 hours to mow the lawn.\n   - Therefore, the time Amalia took to mow the lawn is 4 hours.\n\n2. **Megan's chores:**\n   - Megan had to walk the dog and this took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.\n   - Since Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn, Megan took \\(4 + 2 = 6\\) hours to walk the dog.\n   - Therefore, the time Megan took to walk the dog is 6 hours.\n\n3. **Dior's chores:**\n   - Dior's work was to do laundry.\n   - It took her well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn.\n   - Since Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn, Dior took \\(4 + 4 = 8\\) hours to do laundry.\n   - Therefore, the time Dior took to do laundry is 8 hours.\n\nNow, we sum the times for all three chores:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ hours (Amalia's lawn)} + 6 \\text{ hours (Megan's dog)} + 8 \\text{ hours (Dior's laundry)} = 18 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \\(\\boxed{18}\\) hours.",
    "answer": "Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to do her work, a total of 4+2 = 6 hours.\nAmalia and Megan's total time to finish their work is 6+4 = <<6+4=10>>10 hours.\nIf Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn, and Dior took 4 hours longer than her while doing laundry, Dior took 4+4 = <<4+4=8>>8 hours to do the laundry.\nIn total, they took 10+8 = <<10+8=18>>18 hours together doing their chores.\n#### 18"
