    "question": "Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a certain day. The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, how many doorbell rings did the doorbell make?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of doorbell presses made by each friend and then sum them up.\n\n1. **First Friend:**\n   - The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times.\n   - Number of doorbell presses: \\(20\\).\n\n2. **Second Friend:**\n   - The second friend pressed on the doorbell \\(1/4\\) times more than the first friend.\n   - Number of doorbell presses: \\(20 + \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\\).\n\n3. **Third Friend:**\n   - The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the second friend.\n   - Number of doorbell presses: \\(25 + 10 = 35\\).\n\n4. **Fourth Friend:**\n   - The fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times.\n   - Number of doorbell presses: \\(60\\).\n\nNow, we sum up the number of doorbell presses made by all four friends:\n\\[\n20 + 25 + 35 + 60\n\\]\n\nLet's add these step by step:\n\\[\n20 + 25 = 45\n\\]\n\\[\n45 + 35 = 80\n\\]\n\\[\n80 + 60 = 140\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of doorbell presses is \\(\\boxed{140}\\).",
    "answer": "The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, a total of 1/4*20=<<1/4*20=5>>5 times.\nJerome's second friend pressed on the doorbell 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25\nThe first two friends pressed on the doorbell 25+20=<<25+20=45>>45 times altogether before Jerome could open the door.\nJerome's third friend pressed on the doorbell 60+10=<<60+10=70>>70 times before Jerome could open the door.\nAltogether, Jerome's third and fourth friends pressed on the doorbell 70+60=<<70+60=130>>130 times before Jerome could open.\nThe number of doorbell rings that Jerome's friend made before Jerome could open the door is 130+45=<<130+45=175>>175 times.\n#### 175"
