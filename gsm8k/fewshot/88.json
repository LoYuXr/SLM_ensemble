    "question": "Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If they sold 88,000 copies combined, how many copies did Harald sell?",
    "completion": "To determine how many copies Harald sold, we start by defining the number of copies Harald sold as \\( H \\). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so the number of copies Marilyn sold is \\( 10H \\).\n\nThe total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald combined is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ H + 10H = 88000 \\]\n\nCombining like terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 11H = 88000 \\]\n\nTo find \\( H \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:\n\\[ H = \\frac{88000}{11} \\]\n\\[ H = 8000 \\]\n\nThus, Harald sold \\(\\boxed{8000}\\) copies.",
    "answer": "Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first, we get 10h + h = 88,000\nCombining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000\nDividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000\n#### 8000"
