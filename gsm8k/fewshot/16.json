    "question": "Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time. They begin traveling westward, both traveling for 80 miles. The next day, they travel northwards, covering 150 miles. What's the distance covered by each train in the two days?",
    "completion": "To determine the distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to consider the distance each train travels in the first day and the distance it travels in the second day.\n\n1. **First Day:**\n   - The first train travels westward for 80 miles.\n   - The second train travels northward for 150 miles.\n\n2. **Second Day:**\n   - The first train travels westward for 80 miles.\n   - The second train travels northward for 150 miles.\n\nSince the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is the sum of the distances they traveled in each day.\n\n**Distance covered by the first train in the two days:**\n\\[ 80 \\text{ miles (westward)} + 80 \\text{ miles (westward)} = 160 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\n**Distance covered by the second train in the two days:**\n\\[ 150 \\text{ miles (northward)} + 150 \\text{ miles (northward)} = 300 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the distance covered by the first train in the two days is \\(\\boxed{160}\\) miles, and the distance covered by the second train in the two days is \\(\\boxed{300}\\) miles.",
    "answer": "On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.\nThey also covered 150 miles/train * 2 trains = <<150*2=300>>300 miles together on the second day.\nThe combined distance the two trains covered in the two days is 300 miles + 160 miles = <<300+160=460>>460 miles\nThe average distance for the two days is 460 miles / 2 trains = <<460/2=230>>230 miles/train\n#### 230"
