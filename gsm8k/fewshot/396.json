    "question": "Jenny is dividing up a pizza with 12 slices. She gives 1/3 to Bill and 1/4 to Mark. If Jenny eats 2 slices, how many slices are left?",
    "completion": "To determine how many slices of pizza are left after Jenny eats some, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.\n2. Subtract the number of slices Jenny eats from the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark.\n3. Subtract the number of slices Jenny eats from the remaining slices to find out how many slices are left.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\nJenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill and 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. The total number of slices given to Bill and Mark is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{7}{12} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of slices Jenny eats from the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark:\n\\[ \\frac{7}{12} - 2 = \\frac{7}{12} - \\frac{24}{12} = \\frac{7 - 24}{12} = \\frac{-17}{12} \\]\n\nSince we cannot have a negative number of slices, it means that Jenny cannot give 2 slices to Mark and still have enough slices left. Therefore, the number of slices left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]",
    "answer": "First find how many slices 1/3 of the pizza is by multiplying 1/3 by the total number of slices: 12 slices * 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 slices\nDo the same thing to find how many slices 1/4 of the pizza is: 12 slices * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 slices\nThen subtract the slices each of the three people ate to find the remaining number of slices: 12 slices - 4 slices - 3 slices - 2 slices = <<12-4-3-2=3>>3 slices\n#### 3"
