    "question": "Helga was the fastest clog dancer in all of Slovenia. With both hands at her sides, she could tap her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute, while simultaneously tapping her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute.  When she raised her arms, her tap rate slowed down to 200 taps per minute with each foot.  If she dances a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised during only 2 of those minutes, what would be the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet?",
    "completion": "To determine the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of taps per minute for each foot:\n- Right foot: 300 taps per minute\n- Left foot: 250 taps per minute\n\nNext, we need to determine how many times each foot is tapped during the 5-minute dance period:\n- Total minutes danced: 5\n- Time spent raising arms: 2 minutes\n- Time spent tapping both feet: \\(5 - 2 = 3\\) minutes\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of taps per minute for each foot during the 3 minutes when both feet are tapped:\n- Right foot: \\(300 \\text{ taps/minute} \\times 3 \\text{ minutes} = 900 \\text{ taps}\\)\n- Left foot: \\(250 \\text{ taps/minute} \\times 3 \\text{ minutes} = 750 \\text{ taps}\\)\n\nNow, we need to determine how many times each foot is tapped during the 2 minutes when both feet are raised:\n- Right foot: \\(200 \\text{ taps/minute} \\times 2 \\text{ minutes} = 400 \\text{ taps}\\)\n- Left foot: \\(200 \\text{ taps/minute} \\times 2 \\text{ minutes} = 400 \\text{ taps}\\)\n\nFinally, we add the number of taps for both feet:\n- Total taps: \\(900 \\text{ taps} + 400 \\text{ taps} = 1300 \\text{ taps}\\)\n\nThus, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is \\(\\boxed{1300}\\).",
    "answer": "During the 5 minutes of dancing, 2 minutes were performed with hands raised and 5-2=3 minutes were performed without hands raised.\nWith hands not raised, her right foot tapped 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 times.\nWith hands not raised, her left foot tapped 3*250=<<3*250=750>>750 times.\nWith hands raised, her right foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.\nWith hands raised, her left foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.\nThus, in total, she tapped 900+750+400+400=<<900+750+400+400=2450>>2450 times\n#### 2450"
