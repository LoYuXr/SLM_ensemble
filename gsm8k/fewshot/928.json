    "question": "Rita hand-picks Junebugs off of her plants every summer.  On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.  On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday.  Thursday she removed 48 and on Friday she removed 57.  What is the average number of Junebugs that she removes per day?",
    "completion": "To find the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday:**\n   - Monday: 39 Junebugs\n   - Tuesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs\n   - Wednesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs\n   - Thursday: 48 Junebugs\n   - Friday: 57 Junebugs\n\n   Adding these together:\n   \\[\n   39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perform the addition step-by-step:**\n   \\[\n   39 + 78 = 117\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   117 + 78 = 195\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   195 + 48 = 243\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   243 + 57 = 290\n   \\]\n\n   So, the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday is 290.\n\n3. **Calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of Junebugs}}{\\text{Number of days}} = \\frac{290}{5}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the division:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{290}{5} = 58\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \\(\\boxed{58}\\).",
    "answer": "On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as the 39 on Monday so she removed 2*39 = <<2*39=78>>78 Junebugs\nAll total she has removed 39+78+78+48+57 = <<39+78+78+48+57=300>>300 Junebugs\nShe has removed 300 Junebugs over 5 days so she has removed, on average 300/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 Junebugs per day\n#### 60"
