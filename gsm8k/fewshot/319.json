    "question": "The ratio of the electric poles and electric wires needed to connect and supply the electricity in a certain neighborhood is 1:3. If the total number of electric wires needed to connect the electricity in the neighborhood is 45, calculate the total number of electric poles required by an electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood.",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of electric poles required to supply the electricity in the neighborhood, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of electric wires needed.\n\nThe ratio of the electric poles to the electric wires is given as 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. If the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.\n\nLet \\( P \\) be the number of electric poles and \\( W \\) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{P}{W} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\\[ P = \\frac{W}{3} \\]\n\nWe know that the total number of electric wires is 45, so:\n\\[ W = 45 \\]\n\nNow, substituting \\( W \\) into the equation \\( P = \\frac{W}{3} \\), we get:\n\\[ P = \\frac{45}{3} = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of electric poles required to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is:\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]",
    "answer": "The total ratio representing the number of electric poles and wires is 1+3=<<1+3=4>>4\nThe fraction representing the number of wires required to connect the neighborhood's electricity is <<3/4=3/4>>3/4\nIf 3/4 represents 45, the number of wires required for the connections, then the total fraction which is 4/4, representing the poles and wires needed, represents 4/4*45*4/3=60\nSince the total number of wires and poles required is 60, and the number of electric wires to be used is 45, the number of poles required is 60-45=<<60-45=15>>15\n#### 15"
