    "question": "The cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.  If Kate\u2019s 6 friends each eat 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, how many pizza pies does she need to buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices of cheese and pepperoni pizza that her friends will eat and then figure out how many whole pizza pies are required to provide that amount of pizza.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices:\n- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.\n- Kate has 6 friends, and each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices.\n\\[\n6 \\text{ friends} \\times 6 \\text{ cheese slices per friend} = 36 \\text{ cheese slices}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices:\n- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.\n- Kate has 4 friends, and each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices.\n\\[\n4 \\text{ friends} \\times 4 \\text{ pepperoni slices per friend} = 16 \\text{ pepperoni slices}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the total number of cheese and pepperoni slices to find the total number of slices needed:\n\\[\n36 \\text{ cheese slices} + 16 \\text{ pepperoni slices} = 52 \\text{ slices}\n\\]\n\nSince each pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to determine how many whole pizza pies are required to provide 52 slices:\n\\[\n\\frac{52 \\text{ slices}}{12 \\text{ slices per pizza}} = 4.3333 \\text{ pizzas}\n\\]\n\nSince we cannot buy a fraction of a pizza, Kate needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she needs to buy 5 whole pizza pies.\n\nThus, the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Kate\u2019s friends eat 6 x 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 cheese pizza slices.\nHer friends eat 6 x 4 = <<6*4=24>>24 pepperoni pizza slices.\nKate needs to buy 36 / 12 = <<36/12=3>>3 cheese pizza pies.\nShe needs to buy 24 / 8 = <<24/8=3>>3 pepperoni pizza pies.\nShe needs to buy a total of 3 + 3 = <<3+3=6>>6 pizza pies.\n#### 6"
