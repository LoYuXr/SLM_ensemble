    "question": "Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. This means that each hour the AC uses 900 watts of energy. If he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, how many kilowatts of electric energy will he save in 30 days?",
    "completion": "To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in one day.\n2. Determine the energy saved per day by reducing the usage.\n3. Calculate the total energy saved over 30 days.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in one day.**\n\nThe air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy for 8 hours a day. Therefore, the energy used per day is:\n\\[ 900 \\text{ watts} \\times 8 \\text{ hours} = 7200 \\text{ watt-hours} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the energy saved per day by reducing the usage.**\n\nIf Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the energy saved per day is:\n\\[ 7200 \\text{ watt-hours} \\times 5 \\text{ hours} = 36000 \\text{ watt-hours} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total energy saved over 30 days.**\n\nThe total energy saved over 30 days is:\n\\[ 36000 \\text{ watt-hours/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 1080000 \\text{ watt-hours} \\]\n\nSince 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watt-hours (Wh), we convert the total energy saved from watt-hours to kilowatt-hours:\n\\[ 1080000 \\text{ watt-hours} \\div 1000 = 1080 \\text{ kilowatt-hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total energy saved in 30 days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1080} \\]",
    "answer": "An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watts for 8 hours a day.\nAn air conditioner uses 900 x 5 = <<900*5=4500>>4500 watts for 5 hours a day.\nSo, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.\nThat is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.\nHence, in 30 days he will have 2.7 x 30 = <<2.7*30=81>>81 kilowatts of electric energy saved.\n#### 81"
