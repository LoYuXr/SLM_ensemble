    "question": "Jennifer bought 12 oranges from the market, she gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, and her only boy got 3 oranges. How many oranges did she remain with?",
    "completion": "To determine how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of oranges Jennifer gave to her three daughters.\n2. Add the number of oranges her only boy received to the total from the daughters.\n3. Subtract the total number of oranges given to her daughters and the only boy from the original number of oranges she bought.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. Jennifer bought 12 oranges and gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters. So, the total number of oranges given to her daughters is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ oranges/daughter} \\times 3 \\text{ daughters} = 6 \\text{ oranges}\n   \\]\n\n2. Her only boy received 3 oranges. So, the total number of oranges given to her boy is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ oranges}\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we add the oranges given to her daughters and the only boy to the original 12 oranges she bought:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ oranges} + 6 \\text{ oranges} + 3 \\text{ oranges} = 21 \\text{ oranges}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{21}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Her three daughters received a total of 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 oranges.\nShe gave her children 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 oranges in total.\nShe remained with 12 - 9 = <<12-9=3>>3 oranges.\n#### 3"
