    "question": "Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job. A blog article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and  2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.",
    "completion": "To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Monday:**\n   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.\n   - Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write.\n   - Total hours for Monday = 5 articles * 4 hours/article = 20 hours.\n\n2. **Tuesday:**\n   - Meredith wrote \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times more articles than on Monday.\n   - Number of articles on Tuesday = \\(5 \\times \\frac{2}{5} = 2\\) articles.\n   - Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write.\n   - Total hours for Tuesday = 2 articles * 4 hours/article = 8 hours.\n\n3. **Wednesday:**\n   - Meredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.\n   - Number of articles on Wednesday = \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) articles.\n   - Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write.\n   - Total hours for Wednesday = 4 articles * 4 hours/article = 16 hours.\n\n4. **Total hours for all three days:**\n   - Total hours = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday\n   - Total hours = 20 hours + 8 hours + 16 hours = 44 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is \\(\\boxed{44}\\).",
    "answer": "If she wrote five articles on Monday, then on Tuesday she wrote 2/5* 5 = 2 more articles.\nThe total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5+2 = <<5+2=7>>7\nOn Wednesday, the number of articles was twice the number she wrote on Tuesday, so it was 2*7 = <<2*7=14>>14 articles.\nOver the three days, she wrote 5+7 +14 = <<5+7+14=26>>26 articles.\nIf each article takes her 4 hours to research and write about, she spent 4*26 = <<4*26=104>>104 hours on all the articles.\n#### 104"
