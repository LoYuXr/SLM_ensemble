    "question": "Gabriel and Luri each own a portable media player that can store up to 100 songs. Gabriel has 20 songs on his player while Luri has 3 times as many songs. How many fewer songs can Luri add to his player than Gabriel can add to his?",
    "completion": "To determine how many fewer songs Luri can add to her player than Gabriel can add to his, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of songs Luri has.\n2. Determine how many songs Gabriel can add to his player.\n3. Determine how many songs Luri can add to her player.\n4. Find the difference between the number of songs Luri can add and the number of songs Gabriel can add.\n\nFirst, we know that Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. Therefore, we calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of songs Luri has} = 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many songs Gabriel can add to his player. Since Gabriel's player can store up to 100 songs, the number of songs Gabriel can add is:\n\\[ \\text{Number of songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many songs Luri can add to her player. Since Luri's player can store up to 100 songs, the number of songs Luri can add is:\n\\[ \\text{Number of songs Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40 \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the number of songs Luri can add and the number of songs Gabriel can add:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 40 - 80 = -40 \\]\n\nSince the question asks how many fewer songs Luri can add to her player than Gabriel can add, and the result is negative, it means Luri can add 40 fewer songs than Gabriel. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",
    "answer": "Gabriel can still store 100 - 20 = <<100-20=80>>80 songs.\nLuri has 20 x 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 songs stored in his player.\nThus, Luri can still store 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40 songs.\nLuri can add 80 - 40 = <<80-40=40>>40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel.\n#### 40"
