    "question": "Rose went to the store on Monday and bought 4 cakes. Tuesday she went to a different store and bought three times that number of cakes. On Wednesday she went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she did on Tuesday. How many cakes did she buy after all three days?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Monday:**\n   Rose bought 4 cakes.\n\n2. **Tuesday:**\n   Rose bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ cakes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Wednesday:**\n   Rose bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 12 = 60 \\text{ cakes}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of cakes bought each day to find the total:\n\\[\n4 + 12 + 60 = 76\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \\(\\boxed{76}\\).",
    "answer": "On Monday she bought 4 cakes\nOn Tuesday she bought 4*3=<<4*3=12>>12 cakes\nOn Wednesday she bought 12*5=<<12*5=60>>60 cakes\nRose bought a total of 4+12+60= <<4+12+60=76>>76 cakes during the three days\n#### 76"
