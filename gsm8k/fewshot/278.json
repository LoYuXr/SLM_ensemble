    "question": "Mico and Marco wanted to get to know each other. They realized that the sum of their ages is 20. What will be the sum of their ages in 10 years?",
    "completion": "To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the current ages of Mico and Marco:**\n   - Let \\( M \\) be Mico's current age.\n   - Let \\( R \\) be Marco's current age.\n\n2. **Set up the equation for their current sum of ages:**\n   \\[\n   M + R = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine their ages in 10 years:**\n   - In 10 years, Mico's age will be \\( M + 10 \\).\n   - In 10 years, Marco's age will be \\( R + 10 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate their ages in 10 years:**\n   \\[\n   M + 10 = M + 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   R + 10 = R + 10\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find the sum of their ages in 10 years:**\n   \\[\n   (M + 10) + (R + 10) = M + R + 20\n   \\]\n\n6. **Substitute the known sum of their current ages:**\n   \\[\n   20 + 20 = 40\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
    "answer": "There will be an additional 10 (for Mico) + 10 9for Marco) = <<10+10=20>>20 to Mico and Marco's current sum of ages in 10 years.\nTherefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years is 20 + 20 = <<20+20=40>>40.\n#### 40"
