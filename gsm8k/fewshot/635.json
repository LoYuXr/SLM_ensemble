    "question": "Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $10 per class, then they won't sign him up again. If there are 10 total classes, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?",
    "completion": "To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total cost of the classes:**\n   Manny signed up for 10 classes, and the total cost is $60.\n\n2. **Determine the maximum cost per class:**\n   Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the total cost of the classes exceeds $10 per class.\n\n3. **Calculate the maximum number of classes he can miss:**\n   To find out how many classes he can miss, we divide the total cost by the maximum cost per class:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of classes missed} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost}}{\\text{Maximum cost per class}} = \\frac{60}{10} = 6\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Manny can miss \\(\\boxed{6}\\) classes before his parents won't sign him up again.",
    "answer": "He must attend at least six classes, because 60 / 6 = <<60/6=10>>10\nHe can skip 4 class because 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6\n#### 4"
