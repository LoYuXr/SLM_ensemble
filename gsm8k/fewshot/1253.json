    "question": "Tim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones.  It takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call.  How many calls does he deal with during his 5 day work week?",
    "completion": "To determine how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hours Tim spends on calls in a day.\n2. Convert the daily call time into minutes.\n3. Multiply the daily call time in minutes by the number of days in a week.\n\nFirst, we know that Tim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the daily call time into minutes:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \\text{ minutes/day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many minutes Tim spends on calls in a week. Since there are 5 days in a work week, we multiply the daily call time by 5:\n\\[ 360 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 1800 \\text{ minutes/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1800} \\]",
    "answer": "He spends 6*60=<<6*60=360>>360 minutes dealing with calls\nSo he deals with 360/15=<<360/15=24>>24 calls a day\nSo he deals with 5*24=<<5*24=120>>120 calls a week\n#### 120"
