    "question": "Jen works for 7.5 hours a day 6 days a week. Her hourly rate is $1.5. Jen also receives an additional $10 if she has complete attendance. Suppose Jen did not incur any absences for  April, and there are exactly 4 weeks in April, how much will she receive?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Jen will receive for April, we need to calculate her total earnings based on her hourly rate and the additional $10 she receives for complete attendance.\n\nFirst, let's calculate her daily earnings:\n- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.\n- Her hourly rate is $1.5.\n- Therefore, her daily earnings are:\n  \\[\n  7.5 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 1.5 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 11.25 \\text{ dollars/day}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we calculate her weekly earnings for April. Since there are 4 weeks in April:\n\\[\n11.25 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days/week} = 45 \\text{ dollars/week}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to account for the additional $10 she receives for complete attendance. Since there are 4 weeks in April, the total additional amount she will receive is:\n\\[\n45 \\text{ dollars/week} + 4 \\text{ weeks} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars/week} = 45 \\text{ dollars/week} + 40 \\text{ dollars/week} = 85 \\text{ dollars/week}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate her total earnings for April by adding her weekly earnings to the additional amount:\n\\[\n45 \\text{ dollars/week} + 85 \\text{ dollars/week} = 130 \\text{ dollars/week}\n\\]\n\nThus, Jen will receive \\(\\boxed{130}\\) dollars for April.",
    "answer": "In a week, Jen works for 7.5 hours/day x 6 days = <<7.5*6=45>>45 hours/week\nSo in a month, she works for 45 hours/week x 4 weeks = <<45*4=180>>180 hours.\n180 hours of work is equal to 180 hours x $1.5 = $<<180*1.5=270>>270.\nSince she has complete attendance, she will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $<<270+10=280>>280.\n#### 280"
