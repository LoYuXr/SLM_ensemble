    "question": "Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Movie C was 1.25 hours. How many minutes long was Movie A?",
    "completion": "To determine the length of Movie A, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the length of Movie C:**\n   - We know that Movie C was 1.25 hours long.\n   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 1.25 hours to minutes:\n     \\[\n     1.25 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the length of Movie C is 75 minutes.\n\n2. **Determine the length of Movie B:**\n   - We know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C.\n   - Therefore, the length of Movie B is:\n     \\[\n     75 \\text{ minutes} + 5 \\text{ minutes} = 80 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the length of Movie A:**\n   - We know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B.\n   - Therefore, the length of Movie A is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{80 \\text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the length of Movie A is \\(\\boxed{20}\\) minutes.",
    "answer": "Movie C = 1.25 hours = 75 minutes\nMovie B = 75 + 5 = <<75+5=80>>80 minutes\nMovie A = (1/4) * 80 = <<(1/4)*80=20>>20 minutes\nMovie A was <<20=20>>20 minutes long.\n#### 20"
