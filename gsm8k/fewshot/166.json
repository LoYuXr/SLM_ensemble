    "question": "Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits their daughter. To make a Spanish flan, she needs 3 eggs. If Sandra has been tasked to make 15 Spanish flans for her school fundraiser, how many times does Sandra have to babysit?",
    "completion": "To determine how many times Sandra has to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed for 15 Spanish flans.\n2. Determine how many eggs Sandra needs to make 15 Spanish flans.\n3. Calculate how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get the required number of eggs.\n\nFirst, we know that each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 Spanish flans, Sandra needs:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ flans} \\times 3 \\text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Sandra's neighbor gives her 9 eggs every time she babysits her daughter. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:\n\\[ \\frac{45 \\text{ eggs}}{9 \\text{ eggs/babysitting session}} = 5 \\text{ sessions} \\]\n\nTherefore, Sandra has to babysit \\(\\boxed{5}\\) times.",
    "answer": "Sandra needs a total of 15 x 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 eggs.\nShe will have to babysit 45/9 = <<45/9=5>>5 times.\n#### 5"
