    "question": "Sarah went to buy books from the store and spent $300 on the books. If each book was $15 and she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, how many books did each child get?",
    "completion": "To determine how many books each of Sarah's kids received, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of books Sarah bought:**\n   Sarah spent $300 on books. Since each book costs $15, we can find the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per book.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of books} = \\frac{\\text{Total amount spent}}{\\text{Cost per book}} = \\frac{300}{15} = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many books each child received:**\n   Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child received, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of books per child} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of books}}{\\text{Number of kids}} = \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each child received \\(\\boxed{5}\\) books.",
    "answer": "Since she spent $300 on the books and each book's cost was $15, she bought $300/$15= <<300/15=20>>20 books.\nIf Sarah gave an equal number of books to each of her children, each kid received 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 books.\n#### 5"
