    "question": "David and Dasha went to the carnival, where there are 9 rides.  Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket.  You can also buy a ride bracelet for $30 which gives you 9 rides.  If David buys a ride bracelet and Dasha buys tickets, and they ride all 9 rides, how much money does David save?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both scenarios and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost for David:\n- David buys a ride bracelet for $30.\n- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.\n- Therefore, the cost of one ride is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) dollars.\n- Since David buys a bracelet, the total cost for David is \\(30 + 30 = 60\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost for Dasha:\n- Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides.\n- Each ticket costs $2.\n- Therefore, the total cost for Dasha is \\(9 \\times 2 = 18\\) dollars.\n\nNow, we find the difference in the total costs between David and Dasha:\n- David's total cost: $60\n- Dasha's total cost: $18\n- The difference is \\(60 - 18 = 42\\) dollars.\n\nThus, David saves \\(\\boxed{42}\\) dollars by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying tickets.",
    "answer": "Each ride cost 2 x $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.\nAll 9 rides cost $4 x 9 = $<<4*9=36>>36.\nBy bathing the ride bracelet, David saves $36 - $30 = $<<36-30=6>>6.\n#### 6"
