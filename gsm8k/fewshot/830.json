    "question": "Britany records 18 4-minute TikTok videos each week. She spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs to sing on TikTok, and 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup before filming herself for TikTok. How much time does Britany spend on TikTok in a month with four weeks?",
    "completion": "To determine how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to break down the weekly and monthly contributions to her TikTok activity.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok each week:\n- Britany records 18 videos each week.\n- She spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs.\n- She spends 15 minutes doing makeup each day, six days a week.\n\nFirst, convert the time spent writing songs into minutes:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, convert the time spent doing makeup into minutes:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 6 \\text{ days/week} = 90 \\text{ minutes/week} \\]\n\nNow, add the time spent writing songs and doing makeup to find the total time spent on TikTok each week:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ minutes} + 90 \\text{ minutes} = 210 \\text{ minutes/week} \\]\n\nSince there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:\n\\[ 210 \\text{ minutes/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 840 \\text{ minutes/month} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{840}\n\\]",
    "answer": "First find how long Britany spends recording the videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = <<18*4=72>>72 minutes\nThen find how long she spends writing songs in minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes\nThen find how long Britany spending doing her makeup in a week: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes/week\nThen add the time she spends on videos and song-writing to find the total time she spends on TikTok in a week: 72 minutes/week + 90 minutes/week + 120 minutes/week = <<72+90+120=282>>282 minutes/week\nThen multiply the time spent per week by the number of weeks per month to find the total time spent per month: 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = <<282*4=1128>>1128 minutes/month\n#### 1128"
