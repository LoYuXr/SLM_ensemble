    "question": "Candice put 80 post-it notes in her purse before she headed out to her job at the coffee shop.  On her way, she stopped off at the store and purchased a package of Post-it notes;  At work, she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.  If she had 23 post-it notes remaining overall, how many Post-it notes were in the package that she purchased?",
    "completion": "To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Total number of post-it notes before the purchase:**\n   Candice started with 80 post-it notes.\n\n2. **Total number of cups of coffee she placed on the cups:**\n   She placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.\n\n3. **Total number of post-it notes placed on the cups:**\n   Since she placed one post-it note on each of 220 cups, the total number of post-it notes placed on the cups is:\n   \\[\n   220 \\text{ post-it notes}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total number of post-it notes after the purchase:**\n   After purchasing the package of Post-it notes, she had 23 post-it notes remaining.\n\n5. **Total number of post-it notes before the purchase:**\n   The total number of post-it notes before the purchase is the sum of the post-it notes she had before the purchase and the post-it notes she placed on the cups:\n   \\[\n   80 \\text{ post-it notes} + 220 \\text{ post-it notes} = 300 \\text{ post-it notes}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased:**\n   The number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased is the total number of post-it notes before the purchase minus the total number of post-it notes she had before the purchase:\n   \\[\n   300 \\text{ post-it notes} - 300 \\text{ post-it notes} = 0 \\text{ post-it notes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",
    "answer": "Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.\nThen, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.\nAnd if she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left, then 80+x=220+23\nSubtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=<<220+23-80=163>>163 Post-it notes.\n#### 163"
