    "question": "Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest. Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?",
    "completion": "To determine the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we need to calculate the total distance each of them spat and then find the average of these distances.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey:\n- Zoey has 40 seeds.\n- Each seed is 10 feet long.\n- Therefore, the total distance spat by Zoey is:\n  \\[\n  40 \\text{ seeds} \\times 10 \\text{ feet/seed} = 400 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total distance spat by Sydney:\n- Sydney has 35 seeds.\n- Each seed is 12 feet long.\n- Therefore, the total distance spat by Sydney is:\n  \\[\n  35 \\text{ seeds} \\times 12 \\text{ feet/seed} = 420 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we find the average total distance spat by adding the distances spat by Zoey and Sydney and then dividing by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Average total distance} = \\frac{400 \\text{ feet} + 420 \\text{ feet}}{2} = \\frac{820 \\text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nThus, the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney is \\(\\boxed{410}\\) feet.",
    "answer": "Zoey spits a total distance of 400 feet because 40 x 10 = <<40*10=400>>400\nSydney spits a total distance of 420 feet because 35 x 12 = <<35*12=420>>420\nThis totals to 820 feet because 400 + 420 = <<400+420=820>>820\nThe average total distance is 410 because 820 / 2 = <<820/2=410>>410\n#### 410"
