    "question": "Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. If Gerald spent $10 on a book, how much money did he have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Gerald has left after spending $10 on a book, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total parts of the ratio:**\n   The ratio given is 3:2. This means that for every 3 parts Gerald gets, Julia gets 2 parts. Therefore, the total number of parts in the ratio is:\n   \\[\n   3 + 2 = 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the amount of money each person gets:**\n   Since the total amount of money is $100 and it is divided in the ratio 3:2, we can find out how much each part represents by dividing $100 by 5:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount per part} = \\frac{100}{5} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, each part is worth $20.\n\n3. **Calculate the amount of money Gerald gets:**\n   Gerald gets 3 parts, so we multiply the amount per part by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount Gerald gets} = 3 \\times 20 = 60\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the amount of money Gerald has left:**\n   Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract $10 from the amount he got:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount Gerald has left} = 60 - 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Gerald has left is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
    "answer": "The $100 was divided into 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 parts.\nSo each part is $100/5 = $<<100/5=20>>20.\nSo Gerald received $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.\nGerald bought a book at $<<10=10>>10.\nTherefore, Gerald was left with $60 - $10 = $<<60-10=50>>50.\n#### 50"
