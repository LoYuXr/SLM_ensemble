    "question": "Jen decides to travel to 3 different countries.  He has to pay $400 for the supplies he needs, in total.  The tickets for travel cost, in total, 50% more than the supplies.  How much does travel cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of the travel, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of the supplies.\n2. Calculate the cost of the travel tickets.\n3. Add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the travel tickets to get the total cost of the travel.\n\nLet's start with the cost of the supplies. According to the problem, the supplies cost $400.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost of the travel tickets. The problem states that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. This means the cost of the travel tickets is 150% of the supplies cost. We can calculate this as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of travel tickets} = \\text{Supplies cost} \\times (1 + 0.50) = 400 \\times 1.50 = 600 \\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the travel tickets to find the total cost of the travel:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost of travel} = \\text{Supplies cost} + \\text{Cost of travel tickets} = 400 + 600 = 1000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the travel is \\(\\boxed{1000}\\).",
    "answer": "He pays 400*.5=$<<400*.5=200>>200 more for tickets than supplies\nThat means the tickets cost 400+200=$<<400+200=600>>600\nSo it cost 600+400=$<<600+400=1000>>1000 in total.\n#### 1000"
