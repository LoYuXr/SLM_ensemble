    "question": "Wayne and Bernadette are movie stars heading to the premiere of their latest film. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. The drive from Bernadette\u2019s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne\u2019s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?",
    "completion": "To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to arrive at the premiere theater first, we need to calculate the total travel time for both Wayne and Bernadette and then find the difference in their travel times.\n\n1. **Calculate the total travel time for Wayne:**\n   - Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater.\n   - The drive from Wayne's hotel takes four times as long as the drive from Bernadette's apartment.\n   - Therefore, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) minutes.\n   - The total travel time for Wayne is \\(4 + 16 = 20\\) minutes.\n\n2. **Calculate the total travel time for Bernadette:**\n   - Bernadette takes 5 minutes to drive to the theater.\n   - The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 16 minutes.\n   - The total travel time for Bernadette is \\(5 + 16 = 21\\) minutes.\n\n3. **Determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne:**\n   - The difference in travel time between Wayne and Bernadette is \\(21 - 20 = 1\\) minute.\n   - Therefore, Bernadette should leave 1 minute earlier than Wayne to arrive at the theater first.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",
    "answer": "Bernadette takes 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 minutes to get to the theater.\nHer ride takes 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 minutes longer than Wayne\u2019s to get to the theater.\nThus, she should leave 12 + 5 = <<12+5=17>>17 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater 5 minutes sooner than he does.\n#### 17"
