    "question": "Tobias bought a big pizza with 60 pieces. He ate 2/5 of the pieces on the first day, 10 pieces on the second day, and 7/13 of the remaining pieces on the third day. How many pizza pieces has he eaten so far?",
    "completion": "To determine how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the first day.\n2. Determine the number of pieces remaining after the first day.\n3. Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the second day.\n4. Determine the number of pieces remaining after the second day.\n5. Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the third day.\n6. Determine the number of pieces remaining after the third day.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Tobias ate \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the pizza on the first day. The number of pieces he ate on the first day is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{5} \\times 60 = 24 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\n2. The number of pieces remaining after the first day is:\n   \\[\n   60 - 24 = 36 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\n3. Tobias ate 10 pieces on the second day. The number of pieces remaining after the second day is:\n   \\[\n   36 - 10 = 26 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\n4. Tobias ate \\(\\frac{7}{13}\\) of the remaining pieces on the third day. The number of pieces he ate on the third day is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7}{13} \\times 26 = 14 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\n5. The number of pieces remaining after the third day is:\n   \\[\n   26 - 14 = 12 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total number of pieces Tobias has eaten so far is:\n\\[\n24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \\text{ pieces}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far is \\(\\boxed{48}\\).",
    "answer": "On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5*60 = <<2/5*60=24>>24 pieces of the pizza.\nOn the second day, Tobias ate 10 more pieces of the pizza, totaling 24+10 = <<24+10=34>>34 pieces\nThe number of pieces of pizza remaining is 60-34 = <<60-34=26>>26\nOn the third day, Tobias ate 7/13*26 = <<7/13*26=14>>14 pieces of pizza.\nSo far, he has eaten 14+34 = <<14+34=48>>48 pieces of the pizza he bought.\n#### 48"
