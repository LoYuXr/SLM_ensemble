    "question": "Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does he need to pay for them?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost of each glass and then sum these costs.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of one second glass. The problem states that every second glass costs 60% of the price of a first glass. Since a first glass costs $5, the cost of a second glass is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 0.60 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of 16 glasses. Since each second glass costs $3, the cost for 16 glasses is:\n\\[ 16 \\times 3 = 48 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Kylar needs to pay \\(\\boxed{48}\\) dollars for 16 glasses.",
    "answer": "The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.\nIf every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.\nSo for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.\nAnd for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.\nSo in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.\n#### 64"
