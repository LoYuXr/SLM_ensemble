    "question": "Tyler wants to buy a dictionary that costs $18, a dinosaur book that costs $13, and a children's cookbook that costs $8. He has saved $14 from his allowance. If Tyler earns $5 per hour, how many hours does he have to work to afford his books?",
    "completion": "To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books he wants to buy. The cost of the dictionary is $18, the cost of the dinosaur book is $13, and the cost of the children's cookbook is $8. Adding these amounts together gives:\n\n\\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \\]\n\nSo, the total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has saved $14 from his allowance. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $39, we divide the total cost of the books by the amount he has saved:\n\n\\[ \\frac{39}{14} \\approx 2.7857 \\]\n\nSince Tyler cannot work a fraction of an hour, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, Tyler needs to work 3 hours to afford his books.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Tyler wants to purchase books that cost $18 + $13 + $8 = $<<18+13+8=39>>39.\nTyler needs $39 and currently has $14, so he needs to earn $39 - $14 = $<<39-14=25>>25.\nTyler can earn $25 at a rate of $5 per hour by doing 25 / $5 = <<25/5=5>>5 hours of work.\n#### 5"
