    "question": "Elly is organizing her books on the new bookcases her parents bought her. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?",
    "completion": "To determine how many bookcases Elly needs to hold all her books, we need to calculate the number of books each shelf can hold and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of books on the middle shelf.\n- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as the middle shelf, so the bottom shelf can hold \\( 2x \\) books.\n- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so the top shelf can hold \\( 2x - 5 \\) books.\n\nSince each bookcase can hold 10 books, the total number of books Elly needs to hold is the sum of the books on all three shelves:\n\\[ 10x + 2x + (2x - 5) = 110 \\]\n\nNow, let's simplify and solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ 10x + 2x + 2x - 5 = 110 \\]\n\\[ 14x - 5 = 110 \\]\n\\[ 14x = 115 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{115}{14} \\]\n\\[ x = 8.214285714285714 \\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a book), we need to check if 8 or 9 books on the middle shelf is a reasonable number. Let's check both:\n\nIf \\( x = 8 \\):\n\\[ 10 \\times 8 + 2 \\times 8 + (2 \\times 8 - 5) = 80 + 16 + (16 - 5) = 80 + 16 + 11 = 107 \\]\nThis is less than 110, so 8 books on the middle shelf is not enough.\n\nIf \\( x = 9 \\):\n\\[ 10 \\times 9 + 2 \\times 9 + (2 \\times 9 - 5) = 90 + 18 + (18 - 5) = 90 + 18 + 13 = 111 \\]\nThis is more than 110, so 9 books on the middle shelf is enough.\n\nTherefore, Elly needs 9 bookcases to hold all her",
    "answer": "The bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.\nThe 2 middle shelves can hold a total of 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.\nThe top shelf can hold 20 \u2013 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 books.\nEach bookcase can hold a total of 20 books + 20 books + 15 books = <<20+20+15=55>>55 books.\nTo hold all of her books, she needs 110 / 55 = <<110/55=2>>2 bookcases.\n#### 2"
