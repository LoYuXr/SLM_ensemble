    "question": "In a family of 5, three people eat three eggs each day while the rest eat two eggs each day. If they eat eggs every day, how many eggs will the family consume in a week?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of people in the family:**\n   The family consists of 5 people.\n\n2. **Determine the number of eggs consumed by the people who eat 3 eggs each day:**\n   Each of the 5 people eats 3 eggs per day. Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed by these people in a day is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ people} \\times 3 \\text{ eggs/person/day} = 15 \\text{ eggs/day}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of eggs consumed by the people who eat 2 eggs each day:**\n   Each of the 5 people eats 2 eggs per day. Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed by these people in a day is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ people} \\times 2 \\text{ eggs/person/day} = 10 \\text{ eggs/day}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by all the people in a day:**\n   Adding the eggs consumed by both groups of people, we get:\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ eggs/day} + 10 \\text{ eggs/day} = 25 \\text{ eggs/day}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed in a week:**\n   Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is:\n   \\[\n   25 \\text{ eggs/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 175 \\text{ eggs/week}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the family will consume \\(\\boxed{175}\\) eggs in a week.",
    "answer": "Three persons eat 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 eggs each day.\nSo, 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 persons eat two eggs in a day.\nThus, 2 x 2 = 4 eggs are consumed by the two other people in a day.\nSo the family consumes 9 + 4 = <<9+4=13>>13 eggs each day.\nTherefore, 13 x 7 = <<13*7=91>>91 eggs will be consumed by the family in a week.\n#### 91"
