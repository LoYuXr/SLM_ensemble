    "question": "A store offers sandwiches in 3 different package sizes: the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the second with 4 sandwiches for $6, and a third with 8 sandwiches, but the price is not indicated. Knowing that the prices are proportional, how much will the package with 8 sandwiches cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich and then use that to find the cost of the 8 sandwiches.\n\nFirst, let's denote the price of one sandwich as \\( p \\) dollars. According to the problem, the price of the first package with 2 sandwiches is $3, so the price of one sandwich in the first package is \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) dollars. Similarly, the price of the second package with 4 sandwiches is $6, so the price of one sandwich in the second package is \\( \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2} \\) dollars. The price of the third package with 8 sandwiches is not specified, but we can denote it as \\( q \\) dollars.\n\nSince the prices are proportional, we can set up the following proportion:\n\\[\n\\frac{p}{2} = \\frac{q}{8}\n\\]\nThis equation tells us that the price of one sandwich in the third package is \\( \\frac{q}{8} \\) dollars. To find \\( q \\), we need to determine the total cost of the 8 sandwiches. The total cost of the 8 sandwiches is:\n\\[\n8 \\times \\frac{q}{8} = q\n\\]\nSince the total cost of the 8 sandwiches is the same as the cost of the 8 sandwiches in the third package, we have:\n\\[\nq = 8 \\times \\frac{q}{8} = 8\n\\]\nThis confirms that the price of one sandwich in the third package is indeed $8. Therefore, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",
    "answer": "So the price for 1 sandwich is $3 / 2 sandwiches = $<<3/2=1.5>>1.5/sandwich\nNow the price for the package with 8 sandwiches would be $1.5/sandwich * 8 sandwiches = $<<1.5*8=12>>12\n#### 12"
