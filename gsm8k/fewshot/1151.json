    "question": "Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours. If Sid then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours, what's the average speed he was traveling?",
    "completion": "To find the average speed Sid was traveling, we need to use the formula for average speed, which is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance traveled:\n\\[ \\text{Total distance} = 110 \\text{ miles} + 140 \\text{ miles} = 250 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time taken:\n\\[ \\text{Total time} = 2 \\text{ hours} + 3 \\text{ hours} = 5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:\n\\[ \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} = \\frac{250 \\text{ miles}}{5 \\text{ hours}} = 50 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nSo, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour.",
    "answer": "After traveling 110 miles at first, Sid traveled 110 + 140 = <<110+140=250>>250 miles in total\nSince he spends 3 hours traveling after the first 2 hours, he traveled 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 hours\nOn average, Sid traveled 250 miles / 5 hours = <<250/5=50>>50 miles per hour.\n#### 50"
