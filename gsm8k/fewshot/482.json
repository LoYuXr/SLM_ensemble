    "question": "Keegan was running a car wash with his friend Tashay to raise money for a baseball camp. They needed to raise $200 for the two of them. By 3 pm, Keegan had earned $83 and Tasha had earned $91. How much more did they need to earn to reach their goal?",
    "completion": "To determine how much more money Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal of $200, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money they have already earned.\n2. Subtract the total amount of money they have already earned from their goal to find out how much more they need to earn.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money they have already earned:\n\\[ \\text{Total earned} = \\text{Keegan's earnings} + \\text{Tasha's earnings} = 83 + 91 = 174 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total amount of money they have already earned from their goal to find out how much more they need to earn:\n\\[ \\text{Amount needed} = \\text{Goal} - \\text{Total earned} = 200 - 174 = 26 \\]\n\nTherefore, Keegan and Tashay need to earn \\(\\boxed{26}\\) more dollars to reach their goal.",
    "answer": "They have raised $174 because 83 plus 91 equals <<83+91=174>>174.\nThey need to raise $26 more because 200 minus 174 equals 26.\n#### 26"
