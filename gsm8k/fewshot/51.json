    "question": "Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour.  He is sailing from 1 to 4 PM.  He then travels back at a rate of 6 mph.  How long does it take him to get back?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it takes Tom to travel back from 1 to 4 PM, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to travel from 1 PM to 4 PM at both his original speed and his new speed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel from 1 PM to 4 PM at his original speed of 10 miles per hour:\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{4 \\text{ PM} - 1 \\text{ PM}}{10 \\text{ mph}} = \\frac{3 \\text{ hours}}{10 \\text{ mph}} = 0.3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel from 1 PM to 4 PM at his new speed of 6 mph:\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{4 \\text{ PM} - 1 \\text{ PM}}{6 \\text{ mph}} = \\frac{3 \\text{ hours}}{6 \\text{ mph}} = 0.5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the two times together to find the total time it takes for Tom to travel back from 1 PM to 4 PM:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time} = 0.3 \\text{ hours} + 0.5 \\text{ hours} = 0.8 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Tom \\boxed{0.8} hours to get back from 1 PM to 4 PM.",
    "answer": "He was travelling at full speed for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours\nSo he went 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 miles\nThat means it takes 30/6=<<30/6=5>>5 hours to get back\n#### 5"
