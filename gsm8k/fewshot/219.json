    "question": "Four students scored a total of 251 points in a board game. Naomi scored 68 of the points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi and Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. How many points did Jojo score?",
    "completion": "To determine how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points each of the other three students scored. We know the total points scored by all four students is 251, and we can use this information to find out how many points Naomi scored.\n\nFirst, let's denote the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna as \\( N \\), \\( Y \\), and \\( B \\) respectively. We know:\n\\[ N + Y + B = 251 \\]\n\nWe are also given that Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ Y = \\frac{1}{2}N + 10 \\]\n\nAnd Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ B = N + 17 \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for \\( Y \\) into the equation for \\( B \\):\n\\[ B = N + 17 = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}N + 10 \\right) + 17 = \\frac{1}{2}N + 27 \\]\n\nNow we have expressions for \\( Y \\) and \\( B \\) in terms of \\( N \\):\n\\[ Y = \\frac{1}{2}N + 10 \\]\n\\[ B = \\frac{1}{2}N + 27 \\]\n\nNext, we substitute these expressions into the total points equation:\n\\[ N + \\left( \\frac{1}{2}N + 10 \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{2}N + 27 \\right) = 251 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[ N + \\frac{1}{2}N + \\frac{1}{2}N + 10 + 27 = 251 \\]\n\\[ N + \\frac{1}{2}N + \\frac{1}{2}N = 251 - 10 - 27 \\]\n\\[ N + \\frac{1}{2}N + \\frac{1}{2}N = 214 \\]\n\\[ N + N = 214 \\]\n\\[ 2N = 214 \\]\n\\[ N = 107 \\]\n\nNow that we know \\( N = 107 \\), we can find the points scored by Yuri and Brianna:\n",
    "answer": "Naomi scored 68 points.\nYuri scored 1/2 (68) + 10 = 44 points\nBrianna scored 68 + 17 = <<68+17=85>>85 points\nNaomi, Yuri + Brianna scored = 68 + 44 + 85 = <<68+44+85=197>>197 points\nJojo scored the rest 251 - 197 = <<251-197=54>>54 points\nJojo scored 54 points.\n#### 54"
