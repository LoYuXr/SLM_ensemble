    "question": "At Allan's house, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. He has a total of 40 cannolis in his house. Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house?",
    "completion": "Let's denote the number of cannolis Allan originally had as \\( C \\). According to the problem, Allan originally had 40 cannolis, so we have:\n\n\\[ C = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. Therefore, the number of cannolis Allan has now is:\n\n\\[ C + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100 \\]\n\nThe problem also states that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Let's denote the number of corns Allan originally had as \\( N \\). Since Allan originally had 40 cannolis, the number of corns he originally had is:\n\n\\[ N = 40 \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he originally had. Therefore, the number of corns Allan has now is:\n\n\\[ N - 40 = 40 - 40 = 0 \\]\n\nHowever, since Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he originally had, the number of corns he has now is:\n\n\\[ N - 40 = 40 - 40 = 0 \\]\n\nBut since the problem states that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis, we need to re-evaluate the problem statement. The correct interpretation is that Allan has twice the number of cannolis he originally had, which is 80 (since \\( 40 \\times 2 = 80 \\)).\n\nSo, the number of corns Allan has now is:\n\n\\[ N - 40 = 80 - 40 = 40 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total} = \\text{Number of corns} + \\text{Number of cannolis} = 40 + 100 = 140 \\]\n\nTherefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]",
    "answer": "Before buying any corn and cannoli, Allan had twice as much corn as cannoli, which is 40 cannoli * 2 corn/cannoli = <<40*2=80>>80 corns\nThe total number of corns and cannolis that Allan had before is 80 corn + 40 corn = <<80+40=120>>120 corn\nWhen he bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, he bought 60 corn - 40 corn = <<60-40=20>>20 corns\nIn total, he bought 20 corns + 60 cannolis = <<20+60=80>>80 items\nAfter the purchases, Allan has 120 items + 80 items = <<120+80=200>>200 total corns and cannolis combined.\n#### 200"
