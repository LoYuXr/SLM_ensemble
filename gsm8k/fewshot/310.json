    "question": "Theo has $6000 he wishes to spend on his upcoming business trip to South Africa. He buys 6 business suits at $100 each, 3 suitcases at $50 each, a flight ticket that costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. He wishes to save $2000 for this trip, how much does he have to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Theo needs to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the business suits.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the suitcases.\n3. Determine the cost of the flight ticket.\n4. Calculate the total cost of the business suits and suitcases.\n5. Subtract the amount Theo has already spent from the total cost to find out how much he needs to spend on gifts.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The cost of one business suit is $100. Theo buys 6 business suits.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of business suits} = 6 \\times 100 = 600 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. The cost of one suitcase is $50. Theo buys 3 suitcases.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of suitcases} = 3 \\times 50 = 150 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of one business suit.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of flight ticket} = 5 \\times 100 + 700 = 500 + 700 = 1200 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. The total cost of the business suits and suitcases is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of business suits and suitcases} = 600 + 150 = 750 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. Theo has $6000 initially. After spending $750 on the business suits and suitcases, the amount he has left is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount left} = 6000 - 750 = 5250 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. Theo wishes to save $2000 for this trip. The amount he needs to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount needed for gifts} = 5250 - 2000 = 3250 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Theo needs to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is \\(\\boxed{3250}\\).",
    "answer": "Theo buys business suits for 6 suits * $100/suit = $<<6*100=600>>600.\nTheo buys suitcases for 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $<<3*50=150>>150.\nTheo buys a flight ticket that costs $700 + 5 * $100 = $<<700+5*100=1200>>1200.\nTheo can spend $6000 - $600 - $150 - $1200 - $2000 = $<<6000-600-150-1200-2000=2050>>2050 on gifts for his friends.\n#### 2050"
