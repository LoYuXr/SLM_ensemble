    "question": "Melanie's father opens up an animal farm starting with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Milkie Cows Limited brings him 20 cows per day and Broilers Limited brings him 10 chickens per day, for three weeks. What's the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens brought in by Milkie Cows Limited and Broilers Limited, and then add these to the initial number of animals.\n\n1. **Initial number of animals:**\n   - Cows: 50\n   - Chickens: 20\n\n2. **Number of cows brought in by Milkie Cows Limited:**\n   - Milkie brings 20 cows per day.\n   - There are 3 days in three weeks.\n   - Total number of cows brought in by Milkie: \\( 20 \\text{ cows/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 60 \\text{ cows} \\)\n\n3. **Number of chickens brought in by Broilers Limited:**\n   - Broilers bring 10 chickens per day.\n   - There are 3 days in three weeks.\n   - Total number of chickens brought in by Broilers: \\( 10 \\text{ chickens/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 30 \\text{ chickens} \\)\n\n4. **Total number of animals after three weeks:**\n   - Total number of cows: \\( 50 \\text{ cows} + 60 \\text{ cows} = 110 \\text{ cows} \\)\n   - Total number of chickens: \\( 20 \\text{ chickens} + 30 \\text{ chickens} = 50 \\text{ chickens} \\)\n   - Total number of animals: \\( 110 \\text{ cows} + 50 \\text{ chickens} = 160 \\text{ animals} \\)\n\nThus, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",
    "answer": "Animals were brought to the farm for three weeks, which is 3*7 = <<3*7=21>>21 days.\nThe number of cows brought in by Milkie is 21*20 = <<21*20=420>>420 cows\nThe number of chickens brought in by Broilers is 10*21 = <<10*21=210>>210 chickens.\nThe total number of animals on the farm is 50+20+210+420 = <<50+20+210+420=700>>700 animals\n#### 700"
