    "question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Janet makes at the farmers' market every day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the ducks in a day.\n2. Determine how many eggs are eaten in a day.\n3. Calculate the number of eggs sold at the farmers' market.\n4. Determine the revenue from selling the eggs at the farmers' market.\n\nFirst, we know that Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 muffins for her friends, so the total number of eggs eaten in a day is:\n\\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many eggs are left for sale at the farmers' market. Since she has 16 eggs in total and eats 7 eggs, the number of eggs left for sale is:\n\\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nEach egg is sold for $2, so the revenue from selling the eggs at the farmers' market is:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ eggs} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/egg} = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Janet makes at the farmers' market every day is:\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]",
    "answer": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18"
