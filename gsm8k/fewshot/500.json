    "question": "Together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. Lily found 7 more than David. David found half of what Bodhi found. How many insects did Lily find?",
    "completion": "To determine how many insects Lily found, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- Let \\( D \\) be the number of insects David found.\n- Let \\( L \\) be the number of insects Lily found.\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of insects Bodhi found.\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following information:\n1. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43.\n2. Lily found 7 more insects than David.\n3. David found half as many insects as Bodhi.\n\nWe can translate this information into the following equations:\n1. \\( L + D + B = 43 \\)\n2. \\( L = D + 7 \\)\n3. \\( D = \\frac{1}{2}B \\)\n\nFirst, we substitute the expression for \\( D \\) from the third equation into the second equation:\n\\[ L = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}B\\right) + 7 \\]\n\nNext, we substitute the expressions for \\( L \\) and \\( D \\) into the first equation:\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{1}{2}B\\right) + 7 + B + B = 43 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}B + 7 + B + B = 43 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}B + 2B + 7 = 43 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{5}{2}B + 7 = 43 \\]\n\nSubtract 7 from both sides:\n\\[ \\frac{5}{2}B = 36 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\):\n\\[ B = 36 \\times \\frac{2}{5} \\]\n\\[ B = 14.4 \\]\n\nSince the number of insects must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate our steps. Let's correct the calculation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{2}B = 36 \\]\n\\[ 5B = 72 \\]\n\\[ B = 14.4 \\]\n\nThis indicates a miscalculation. Let's recheck the problem constraints and equations. The correct approach should be:\n\nFrom \\( D = \\frac{1}{2}B \\), we get \\( B = 2D \\). Substitute \\( B = 2D",
    "answer": "Let B = the number of insects Bodhi collected\nDavid = B/2\nLily = B/2 + 7\nB + B + 7 = 43\n2B = <<36=36>>36\nB = <<18=18>>18 insects\nDavid = 18/2 = <<18/2=9>>9 insects\nLily = 9 + 7 = <<9+7=16>>16 insects\nLily found <<16=16>>16 insects.\n#### 16"
