    "question": "To fund his store, Mr. Josue solicited money from two banks. The first bank gave him $4000, and the second company gave him twice as much. If he initially had $5000 in capital, how much capital does he have now?",
    "completion": "To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the amount of money given by the first bank.\n2. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.\n3. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.\n\nFirst, we know that the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second company gave him twice as much as the first bank. Therefore, the amount given by the second bank is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4000 = 8000 \\]\n\nNext, we add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital:\n\\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \\]\n\nSo, the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now is:\n\\[ \\boxed{17000} \\]",
    "answer": "If the second bank gave him twice as much money as the first bank, he received 2*$4000 = $<<2*4000=8000>>8000 from the second bank.\nThe total amount of money Mr. Josue got from the two banks is $8000+$4000 = $<<8000+4000=12000>>12000\nIf he initially had capital of $5000, his capital now is $12000+$5000= $17000\n#### 17000"
