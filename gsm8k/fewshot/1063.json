    "question": "James gets 80 emails a day.  20% of those emails don't require any response.  He responds to the rest of them.  How many emails does he respond to in a 5 day work week?",
    "completion": "To determine how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of emails that do not require any response.\n2. Determine the number of emails that do require a response.\n3. Calculate the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of emails that do not require any response. Since 20% of the emails do not require any response, we can find this number by multiplying the total number of emails by 20% (or 0.20):\n\n\\[ 80 \\times 0.20 = 16 \\]\n\nSo, 16 emails do not require any response.\n\nNext, we determine the number of emails that do require a response. Since the rest of the emails do require a response, we subtract the number of emails that do not require any response from the total number of emails:\n\n\\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \\]\n\nSo, 64 emails require a response.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. Since he responds to the rest of the emails, we multiply the number of emails that do require a response by 5:\n\n\\[ 64 \\times 5 = 320 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is \\(\\boxed{320}\\).",
    "answer": "He gets 80*.2=<<80*.2=16>>16 emails he doesn't need to respond to\nSo he responds to 80-16=<<80-16=64>>64 emails\nSo he responds to 64*5=<<64*5=320>>320 emails a week\n#### 320"
