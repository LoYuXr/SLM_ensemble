    "question": "Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max has. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, and Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. If Katarina has 68 cookies, how many cookies do they have in total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of cookies Katarina, Max, and Summer have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of cookies Max has:**\n   - We know that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.\n   - Katarina has 68 cookies.\n   - Therefore, Max has \\( 68 + 5 = 73 \\) cookies.\n\n2. **Determine the number of cookies Max has:**\n   - We know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.\n   - Let the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has be \\( x \\).\n   - Therefore, Max has \\( x + 12 \\) cookies.\n\n3. **Determine the number of cookies Max has:**\n   - We know that Max has 73 cookies.\n   - Therefore, \\( x + 12 = 73 \\).\n   - Solving for \\( x \\), we get \\( x = 73 - 12 = 61 \\).\n   - So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.\n\n4. **Determine the number of cookies Max has:**\n   - We know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.\n   - Therefore, Max has \\( 61 + 12 = 73 \\) cookies.\n\n5. **Determine the number of cookies Max has:**\n   - We know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.\n   - Therefore, Max has \\( 61 + 12 = 73 \\) cookies.\n\n6. **Determine the number of cookies Max has:**\n   - We know that Max has 23 more cookies than Max.\n   - Therefore, Max has \\( 73 + 23 = 96 \\) cookies.\n\n7. **Calculate the total number of cookies:**\n   - Katarina has 68 cookies.\n   - Max has 73 cookies.\n   - Summer has 96 cookies.\n   - Therefore, the total number of cookies is \\( 68 + 73 + 96 = 237 \\).\n\nThus, the total number of cookies Katarina, Max, and Summer have is \\(\\boxed{237}\\).",
    "answer": "Max\u2019s has a total of 68+5 = <<68+5=73>>73 cookies.\nCookie Monster\u2019s total amount of cookies is 73-12 = <<73-12=61>>61.\nSummer\u2019s total cookie amount is 73+23 = <<73+23=96>>96.\nTotal amount of cookies 68+73+61+96 = <<68+73+61+96=298>>298.\n#### 298"
