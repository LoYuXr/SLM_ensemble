    "question": "The cell-phone recharges at the rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. Now, the phone is at 60% charged. How long will it take to fully charge, in hours?",
    "completion": "To determine how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the charging rate**: The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes.\n\n2. **Convert the percentage point to minutes**: Since 1 percentage point is 1/100 of a minute, we can convert 1% to minutes as follows:\n   \\[\n   1\\% = \\frac{1}{100} \\text{ minutes} = 0.01 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total time to charge the phone**: The phone is currently at 60% charge. To find out how long it will take to charge the remaining 40% (since 100% - 60% = 40%), we use the charging rate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Percentage of charge}}{\\text{Charging rate}} = \\frac{40\\%}{0.01 \\text{ minutes}} = 4000 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours**: Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 4000 minutes to hours:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time in hours} = \\frac{4000 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes/hour}} = \\frac{4000}{60} \\approx 66.67 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take approximately 66.67 hours to fully charge the phone.",
    "answer": "100-60=<<100-60=40>>40 percentage points.\nThen 40*3=<<40*3=120>>120 minutes to fully charge.\nAnd 120/60=<<120/60=2>>2 hours.\n#### 2"
