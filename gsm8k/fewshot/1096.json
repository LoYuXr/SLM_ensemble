    "question": "Billy is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes. He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off, and helps people on all the other days. How many people does he help? (Remember there are 31 days in March.)",
    "completion": "To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of days Billy works.\n2. Determine the number of days he works off.\n3. Calculate the number of people he helps based on the number of days he works off.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of days Billy works. He works 3 hours a day for 31 days in March, so the total number of days he works is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 31 \\text{ days} = 93 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many days he works off. He takes 20% of the days off, so the number of days he works off is:\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 93 \\text{ days} = 18.6 \\text{ days} \\]\nSince he can't work a fraction of a day, we round this to the nearest whole number, which is 19 days.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many people he helps. He helps 2 people per hour, and he works 19 hours a day. Therefore, the total number of people he helps is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ people/hour} \\times 19 \\text{ hours/day} = 38 \\text{ people/day} \\]\nSince he works 31 days in March, the total number of people he helps is:\n\\[ 38 \\text{ people/day} \\times 31 \\text{ days} = 1178 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of people Billy helps is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1178} \\]",
    "answer": "First find the number of days between March 1st and April 19th: 31 days + 19 days = <<31+19=50>>50 days\nThen subtract the percentage of time Billy takes off from 100% to find the percentage of time he works: 100% - 20% = 80%\nThen multiply that number by 80% to find the number of days Billy works: 50 days * 80% = <<50*80*.01=40>>40 days\nThen find how many people Billy can help per day: 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = <<2*3=6>>6 people/day\nThen multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works to find the total number of people he helps: 6 people/day * 40 days = <<6*40=240>>240 people\n#### 240"
