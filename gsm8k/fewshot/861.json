    "question": "Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month.  It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge than Claire.  Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.  How many more badges does Wendy earn compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of badges Amber earns in a year:**\n   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.\n   - It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.\n   - Therefore, it takes Amber \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) months to earn a badge.\n   - Since there are 12 months in a year, Amber earns \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) badges in a year.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of badges Wendy earns in a year:**\n   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.\n   - Therefore, Wendy earns \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\) badges per month.\n   - Since there are 12 months in a year, Wendy earns \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\) badges in a year.\n\n3. **Determine how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber:**\n   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.\n   - Claire earns 24 badges in a year.\n   - The difference is \\(36 - 24 = 12\\) badges.\n\nThus, Wendy earns \\(\\boxed{12}\\) more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.",
    "answer": "Claire earns 1 badge every month so over 12 months she earns 1*12 = <<1*12=12>>12 badges\nIt takes Amber twice as long as Claire to earn a badge so over 1 year she earns 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 badges\nWendy earns 3 times the amount of badges compared to Claire who earns 12 badges so over 1 year Wendy earns 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 badges\nWendy earns 36 badges while Amber earns 6 so Wendy has earned 36-6 = <<36-6=30>>30 more badges\n#### 30"
