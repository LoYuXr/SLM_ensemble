    "question": "Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats, how many cupcakes did Carly make?",
    "completion": "To determine how many cupcakes Carly made, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the variables:**\n   Let \\( c \\) be the number of cupcakes Carly made.\n\n2. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**\n   Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Therefore, the number of brownies she makes is \\( 3c - 2 \\).\n\n3. **Set up another equation for the total number of treats:**\n   Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is \\( 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\).\n\n4. **Combine the equations:**\n   The total number of treats can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   c + (3c - 2) = 10\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the equation:**\n   Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   c + 3c - 2 = 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4c - 2 = 10\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\( c \\):**\n   Add 2 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   4c = 12\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 4:\n   \\[\n   c = 3\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Carly made \\(\\boxed{3}\\) cupcakes.",
    "answer": "First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats\nNext, express the number of brownies in terms of the number of cupcakes based on the problem information: b = 3c - 2, where b is the number of brownies and c is the number of cupcakes\nWe know that b + c = 10, the total number of treats, so now we can substitute in the expression for b from the last step: 3c - 2 + c = 10\nNow we combine like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10\nWe add two to both sides of the equation to get 4c = 12\nFinally, we divide both sides by 4 to get c = 3\n#### 3"
