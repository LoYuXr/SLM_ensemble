    "question": "Tom plants 10 trees a year.  Every year he also chops down 2 trees a year.  He starts with 50 trees.  After 10 years 30% of the trees die.  How many trees does he have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to account for both the trees he plants and the trees he chops down each year. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.\n2. **Trees planted each year**: Tom plants 10 trees a year.\n3. **Trees chopped down each year**: Tom chops down 2 trees a year.\n4. **Trees that die each year**: 30% of the trees die each year.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over 10 years:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ trees/year} \\times 10 \\text{ years} = 100 \\text{ trees} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of trees chopped down over 10 years:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ trees/year} \\times 10 \\text{ years} = 20 \\text{ trees} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of trees that die over 10 years:\n\\[ 30\\% \\text{ of } 50 \\text{ trees} = 0.30 \\times 50 = 15 \\text{ trees} \\]\n\nTo find the net change in the number of trees over 10 years, we subtract the number of trees that die from the number of trees that are planted:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ trees planted} - 15 \\text{ trees died} = 85 \\text{ trees} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the net change in the number of trees to the initial number of trees:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ initial trees} + 85 \\text{ net change} = 135 \\text{ trees} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{135}\n\\]",
    "answer": "He gets 10-2=<<10-2=8>>8 new trees a year\nAfter 10 years he has 8*10=<<8*10=80>>80 new trees\nSo he had 80+50=<<80+50=130>>130 trees\nHe lost 130*.3=<<130*.3=39>>39 trees\nThat means he had 130-39=<<130-39=91>>91 trees\n#### 91"
