    "question": "George, a grade six teacher, ordered 600 burritos for the sixth-grade class picnic. If there were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given ten burritos, with Mr. George eating 20 of them, calculate the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students.\n2. Subtract the number of burritos Mr. George ate from the total number of burritos given.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given is:\n\\[ 50 \\times 10 = 500 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of burritos Mr. George ate from the total number of burritos given. Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so the number of leftover burritos is:\n\\[ 500 - 20 = 480 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:\n\\[ \\boxed{480} \\]",
    "answer": "The total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50*10 = <<50*10=500>>500\nIf Mr George also ate 20, the total number of burritos eaten at the picnic is 500+20 = <<500+20=520>>520\nThere were 600-520 = <<600-520=80>>80 leftover burritos.\n#### 80"
