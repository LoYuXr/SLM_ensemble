    "question": "Hannah's city is having a big display of fireworks for the 4th of July. They're going to set off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. How many fireworks will Hannah see in total?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate each part separately.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by Hannah's city for the 4th of July:\n- Hannah's city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.\n- Therefore, the total number of fireworks is:\n  \\[\n  15 \\times 20 = 300\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many fireworks Hannah will see in her backyard. Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.\n- The total number of fireworks in her backyard is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 5 = 15\n  \\]\n\nNow, we add the fireworks from both Hannah's city and her backyard to find the total number of fireworks she will see:\n- The total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:\n  \\[\n  300 + 15 = 315\n  \\]\n\nThus, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{315}\n\\]",
    "answer": "First find the total number of fireworks the city sets off: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = <<15*20=300>>300 fireworks\nThen multiply that number by the proportion of the fireworks Hannah can see: 300 fireworks * 40% = <<300*40*.01=120>>120 fireworks\nThen find the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her own backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = <<3*5=15>>15 fireworks\nThen add the number of city fireworks to the number of personal fireworks to find the total number of fireworks: 15 fireworks + 120 fireworks = <<15+120=135>>135 fireworks\n#### 135"
