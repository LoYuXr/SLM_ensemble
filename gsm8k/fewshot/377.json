    "question": "Lucy sells apples from her orchard at $4 per piece. On Monday, she sold all the apples picked. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. Come Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day. If Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, how many apples did she pick over the three days?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of apples picked on Tuesday:**\n   - On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked.\n   - On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of apples picked on Wednesday:**\n   - On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day.\n   - Since she picked 12 apples on Tuesday, she picked \\( 12 \\times 2 = 24 \\) apples on Wednesday.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days:**\n   - Monday: 12 apples\n   - Tuesday: 12 apples\n   - Wednesday: 24 apples\n\n   Adding these together:\n   \\[\n   12 + 12 + 24 = 48\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is \\(\\boxed{48}\\).",
    "answer": "Since each apple costs $4, it means that on Monday, Lucy picked 56/4 = <<56/4=14>>14 apples\nCombining Monday and Tuesday, Lucy picked 14 + 12 = <<14+12=26>>26 apples\nOn Wednesday, she picked 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 apples\nAll together, Lucy picked 26 + 24 = <<26+24=50>>50 apples.\n#### 50"
