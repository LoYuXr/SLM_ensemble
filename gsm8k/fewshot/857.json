    "question": "The amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. If the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 6000 gallons on the third day, calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point.",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial amount of water passing through the river at the point of interest.\n2. Calculate the amount of water passing through the river after the first day of heavy rain.\n3. Calculate the amount of water passing through the river after the second day of heavy rain.\n4. Calculate the amount of water passing through the river after the third day of heavy rain.\n5. Sum the amounts of water passing through the river over the three days.\n\nLet's start with the initial amount of water passing through the river at the point of interest:\n\\[ \\text{Initial amount} = 4000 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nAfter the first day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles:\n\\[ \\text{Amount after first day} = 4000 \\times 2 = 8000 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nAfter the second day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles again:\n\\[ \\text{Amount after second day} = 8000 \\times 2 = 16000 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nAfter the third day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles once more:\n\\[ \\text{Amount after third day} = 16000 \\times 2 = 32000 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNow, we sum the amounts of water passing through the river over the three days:\n\\[ \\text{Total amount} = 4000 + 8000 + 16000 + 32000 = 58000 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:\n\\[ \\boxed{58000} \\]",
    "answer": "After a day of rain, the volume of water in the river passing at one point in time doubled to 2*4000 = <<2*4000=8000>>8000 gallons.\nAfter more heavy rains, the volume of water passing through the river on the third day is 8000+6000 = <<8000+6000=14000>>14000 gallons.\n#### 14000"
