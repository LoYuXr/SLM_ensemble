    "question": "Adam has $100 and wants to spend it to open a rock stand. He can buy rocks for $5 each and sell them for $7 each. If he invests all his money in the rock stand but only sells 60% of his inventory, how much money does he lose?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Adam can spend on rocks.\n2. Determine how much money Adam sells.\n3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the rocks.\n4. Find out how much money Adam loses by subtracting the total revenue from the total amount of money he started with.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Adam can spend on rocks.**\n\nAdam has $100 and can buy rocks for $5 each. Therefore, the total amount of money he can spend on rocks is:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much money Adam sells.**\n\nAdam sells 60% of his inventory. So, the amount of money he sells is:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ dollars} \\times 0.60 = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the rocks.**\n\nThe revenue from selling the rocks is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ dollars} \\times 7 \\text{ dollars per rock} = 420 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Find out how much money Adam loses.**\n\nThe amount of money Adam loses is the difference between the total amount of money he started with and the total revenue from selling the rocks:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ dollars} - 420 \\text{ dollars} = -320 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince the result is negative, it means Adam loses $320. Therefore, the amount of money Adam loses is:\n\\[ \\boxed{320} \\]",
    "answer": "He can buy 20 rocks because 100 / 5 = <<100/5=20>>20\nHe sells 12 of these rocks because 20 x .6 = <<20*.6=12>>12\nHe makes $84 selling these because 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84\nHe lost $16 on his business because 100 - 84 = <<100-84=16>>16\n#### 16"
