    "question": "Four dogs sat in a line within the veterinarian's waiting room.  The first dog was the Affenpinscher, who weighed only 10 pounds.  Next to him sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher.  Next to the Dachshund sat a Papillon, who weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.  And at the end of the line sat a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon.  How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?",
    "completion": "To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we need to follow the sequence of weights and relationships given in the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Weight of the Affenpinscher:**\n   The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.\n\n2. **Weight of the Dachshund:**\n   The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight of the Dachshund} = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Weight of the Papillon:**\n   The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight of the Papillon} = \\frac{20}{4} = 5 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Weight of the Mastiff:**\n   The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight of the Mastiff} = 44 \\times 5 = 220 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the weight of the Mastiff is \\(\\boxed{220}\\) pounds.",
    "answer": "The Affenpinscher weighed 10 pounds, and the Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, or 2*10=20 pounds.\nThe Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, or 20/4=<<20/4=5>>5 pounds.\nAnd the Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, or 5*44=<<44*5=220>>220 pounds.\n#### 220"
