    "question": "John's car breaks down.  The car weighs 1200 pounds and he has luggage in it weighing 250 pounds.  He also has his two young children who weigh 75 pounds each in it.  If the force to move the car is 1% of the weight how much force does he need to push the car?",
    "completion": "To determine the force needed to move the car, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of the car and its luggage.\n2. Determine the force required to move the car based on the given percentage.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of the car and its luggage:\n- The car weighs 1200 pounds.\n- The luggage weighs 250 pounds.\n- The two children weigh 75 pounds each, so the total weight of the children is \\(75 \\times 2 = 150\\) pounds.\n\nAdding these together gives the total weight of the car and its luggage:\n\\[ 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out what percentage of this total weight is required to move the car. The problem states that the force to move the car is 1% of the weight. Therefore, we calculate 1% of the total weight:\n\\[ 1\\% \\text{ of } 1600 = 0.01 \\times 1600 = 16 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSo, the force needed to push the car is \\(\\boxed{16}\\) pounds.",
    "answer": "His two children weigh 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 pounds\nSo the total weight of the car and everything is 1200+250+150=<<1200+250+150=1600>>1600 pounds\nSo he needs to generate 1600*.01=<<1600*.01=16>>16 pounds\n#### 16"
