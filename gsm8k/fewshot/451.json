    "question": "On a certain day, the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. How much did Bentley pay to fill 170 balloons if he went to fill them after the price increase?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the original cost per balloon:**\n   The total cost to fill 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per balloon} = \\frac{900}{20} = 45 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the new cost per balloon after the price increase:**\n   The price of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:**\n   The total cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \\times 65 = 11050 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{11050}\n\\]",
    "answer": "If the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900 before the price increase, the cost of filling one balloon was $900/20=$<<900/20=45>>45\nTwo days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20 to $45+$20=$<<45+20=65>>65\nIf Bentley had 170 balloons that he wanted to fill, after the price increase, Bentley paid 170*$65=$<<170*65=11050>>11050 to fill 170 balloons.\n#### 11050"
