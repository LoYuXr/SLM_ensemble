    "question": "Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. She is planning to add a device that will consume 2 kilowatts per hour a day. If a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, how much is the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device?",
    "completion": "To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device.\n2. Calculate Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device.\n3. Calculate the weekly electric bill before adding the new device.\n4. Calculate the weekly electric bill after adding the new device.\n5. Find the difference between the two weekly electric bills.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device.**\n\nAda's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily electric consumption is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ kilowatts/hour} \\times 24 \\text{ hours/day} = 288 \\text{ kilowatts/day} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device.**\n\nThe new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour. Therefore, her daily electric consumption after adding the new device is:\n\\[ 288 \\text{ kilowatts/day} + 2 \\text{ kilowatts/day} = 290 \\text{ kilowatts/day} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the weekly electric bill before adding the new device.**\n\nThere are 7 days in a week, so her weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is:\n\\[ 290 \\text{ kilowatts/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 2030 \\text{ kilowatts/week} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the weekly electric bill after adding the new device.**\n\nThe weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is:\n\\[ 290 \\text{ kilowatts/day} + 2 \\text{ kilowatts/day} = 302 \\text{ kilowatts/day} \\]\n\n**Step 5: Find the difference between the two weekly electric bills.**\n\nThe difference in weekly electric bills is:\n\\[ 2030 \\text{ kilowatts/week} - 302 \\text{ kilowatts/week} = 1728 \\text{ kilowatts/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1728} \\]",
    "answer": "Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.\nSo, her weekly electric bill is 84 x $1.50 = $<<84*1.5=126>>126.\nAda's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.\nSo her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.\nAda's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147\nTherefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $<<147-126=21>>21.\n#### 21"
