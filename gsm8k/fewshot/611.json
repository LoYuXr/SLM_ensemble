    "question": "John decides to build a program capable of identifying cancer cells.  He gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.  His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month.  How much did his research cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial funding and the additional funding over the 10-month period.\n\n1. **Initial Funding:**\n   John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.\n\n2. **Additional Funding:**\n   After the first 5 months, the funding increases by 50% each month. This means the funding for each subsequent month is 1.5 times the funding of the previous month.\n\n   Let's calculate the funding for each month:\n   - Month 1: $100,000\n   - Month 2: $100,000 \\times 1.5 = $150,000\n   - Month 3: $150,000 \\times 1.5 = $225,000\n   - Month 4: $225,000 \\times 1.5 = $337,500\n   - Month 5: $337,500 \\times 1.5 = $506,250\n\n3. **Total Funding:**\n   Now, we sum up the funding for all 10 months:\n   \\[\n   100,000 + 150,000 + 225,000 + 337,500 + 506,250 = 1,219,750\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of John's research is \\(\\boxed{1,219,750}\\).",
    "answer": "The research ended up taking 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 months\nSo he paid for expensive research for 50-5=<<50-5=45>>45 months\nEach month of research at the cheaper stage cost 100,000/5=$<<100000/5=20000>>20,000\nSo the more expensive research cost 20,000*1.5=$<<20000*1.5=30000>>30,000\nSo that research cost 45*30,000=$<<45*30000=1350000>>1,350,000\nSo the total cost was 1,350,000+100,000=$<<1350000+100000=1450000>>1,450,000\n#### 1,450,000"
