    "question": "Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles.  For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 tapered candles.  One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies.   If he sells each candle for $2.00 each, what is his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?",
    "completion": "To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of materials for one candle:**\n   - One pound of beeswax costs $10.00.\n   - One pound of wicks costs $10.00.\n   - Therefore, the cost of one candle is:\n     \\[\n     10.00 + 10.00 = 20.00 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the revenue from selling 20 candles:**\n   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.\n   - Therefore, the revenue from selling 20 candles is:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 2.00 = 40.00 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the profit from selling 20 candles:**\n   - Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.\n   - Total cost for 20 candles is:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 20.00 = 400.00 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - Total revenue from selling 20 candles is:\n     \\[\n     40.00 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the profit is:\n     \\[\n     40.00 - 400.00 = -360.00 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nSo, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \\(-\\$360.00\\). This means he incurs a loss of $360.00.",
    "answer": "1 pound of beeswax and the wick make 10 candles and he wants to make 20 candles so he needs 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 pounds of beeswax\n1 pound of beeswax costs $10.00 and he needs 2 pounds so his supplies will cost 10*2 = $<<10*2=20.00>>20.00\nHe wants to sell each candle for $2.00 each and he's selling 20 candles so that's 2*20 = $<<2*20=40.00>>40.00\nIf he makes $40.00 selling candles and his supplies cost $20.00 then his net profit is 40-20 = $<<40-20=20.00>>20.00\n#### 20"
