    "question": "Ophelia and Jenna are living in the same apartment building. They each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. If Ophelia has 20 sofas, calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that they have.",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have, we start by defining the variables and using the given information.\n\nLet \\( O \\) represent the number of sofas Ophelia has, and \\( J \\) represent the number of chairs Jenna has.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \\( O = 20 \\).\n2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \\( J = 3 \\times O \\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of chairs Jenna has:\n\\[\nJ = 3 \\times 20 = 60\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of sofas Jenna has:\n\\[\nO = 20\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the total number of sofas and chairs by adding the number of sofas and chairs together:\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = O + J = 20 + 60 = 80\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{80}\n\\]",
    "answer": "If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20+2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.\nJenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, a total of 3*22 = <<3*22=66>>66 chairs\nThe total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 66+22 = <<66+22=88>>88\nSince Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the total number of sofas she has is 66-2 = <<66-2=64>>64 sofas.\nThe total number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have is 64+20 = <<64+20=84>>84 sofas\nTogether, they have 84 sofas+88 chairs = <<84+88=172>>172\n#### 172"
