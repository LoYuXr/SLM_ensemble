    "question": "Rong has been saving 20 coins in his piggy bank every month. Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong. How many coins are they having ten years after they started their savings?",
    "completion": "To determine how many coins Rong and Neil have saved ten years after starting their savings, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of coins Rong has saved in ten years.\n2. Calculate the number of coins Neil has saved in ten years.\n3. Add the number of coins saved by Rong and Neil to get the total.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of coins Rong has saved in ten years. Rong saves 20 coins per month, and there are 12 months in a year. Therefore, in ten years, Rong will have saved:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ coins/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} \\times 10 \\text{ years} = 2400 \\text{ coins} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of coins Neil has saved in ten years. Neil saves \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times more coins than Rong per month. This means Neil saves \\(20 \\text{ coins/month} + \\frac{2}{5} \\times 20 \\text{ coins/month} = 20 \\text{ coins/month} + 8 \\text{ coins/month} = 28 \\text{ coins/month}\\). Therefore, in ten years, Neil will have saved:\n\\[ 28 \\text{ coins/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} \\times 10 \\text{ years} = 3360 \\text{ coins} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of coins saved by Rong and Neil to get the total:\n\\[ 2400 \\text{ coins} + 3360 \\text{ coins} = 5760 \\text{ coins} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of coins they have saved ten years after starting their savings is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5760} \\]",
    "answer": "Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong, a total of 2/5*20 = <<2/5*20=8>>8 more coins.\nThe total number of coins that Neil has been saving in his piggy month per month is 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 coins.\nIf Rong has been saving 20 coins every month for ten years, the total number of months he's been saving for is 12*10 = <<12*10=120>>120 months.\nSaving 20 coins every month for ten years, Rong has 20*120 = <<20*120=2400>>2400 coins in his piggy bank.\nIf Neil has also been saving for ten years, he has saved 120*28 = <<120*28=3360>>3360 coins in his piggy bank.\nThe total number of coins they both have in their piggy banks after ten years of saving is 3360+2400 = <<3360+2400=5760>>5760\n#### 5760"
