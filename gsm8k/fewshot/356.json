    "question": "Dean's mother gave him $28 to go to the toy store. Dean bought 6 toy cars and 5 teddy bears. Each toy car cost $2 and each teddy bear cost $1. His mother then feels generous and decides to give him an extra $10. How much money does Dean have left?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Dean has left after his purchases and the extra money his mother gives him, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the toy cars.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the teddy bears.\n3. Add the cost of the toy cars and the cost of the teddy bears to find the total amount spent.\n4. Add the extra $10 given by his mother to the total amount spent.\n5. Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Dean had.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n\n1. The cost of 6 toy cars is \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\) dollars.\n2. The cost of 5 teddy bears is \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\) dollars.\n3. The total amount spent is \\(12 + 5 = 17\\) dollars.\n4. Adding the extra $10 given by his mother, the total amount spent is \\(17 + 10 = 27\\) dollars.\n5. Dean initially had $28, so the amount of money he has left is \\(28 - 27 = 1\\) dollar.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Dean has left is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",
    "answer": "The cost of the toy cars is 6 cars \u00d7 $2/car = $<<6*2=12>>12.\nThe cost of the teddy bears is 5 bears \u00d7 $1/bear = $<<5*1=5>>5.\nThe total cost of the toys is $12 + $5 = $<<12+5=17>>17.\nAdding the two amounts of money his mother gave him, we find that Dean has $28 + $10 = $<<28+10=38>>38 to spend.\nDean has $38 \u2212 $17 = $21 left.\n#### 21"
