    "question": "Sophia is thinking of taking a road trip in her car, and would like to know how far she can drive on a single tank of gas. She has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. The owner's manual for her car says that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophia drive on a single tank of gas?",
    "completion": "To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total distance driven in gallons:**\n   Sophia has driven 100 miles and needed to fill her tank again with 4 gallons of gas.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total distance driven in gallons} = 100 \\text{ miles} + 4 \\text{ gallons} = 104 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the fuel efficiency of the car:**\n   The owner's manual states that the car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas.\n\n3. **Calculate the distance driven per gallon:**\n   To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on one gallon of gas, we divide the total distance driven by the tank capacity.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance driven per gallon} = \\frac{104 \\text{ gallons}}{12 \\text{ gallons}} = \\frac{104}{12} \\text{ miles per gallon} = \\frac{26}{3} \\text{ miles per gallon} \\approx 8.67 \\text{ miles per gallon}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total distance driven on a single tank of gas:**\n   Now, we multiply the distance driven per gallon by the tank capacity.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total distance driven on a single tank} = \\frac{26}{3} \\text{ miles per gallon} \\times 12 \\text{ gallons} = \\frac{26 \\times 12}{3} \\text{ miles} = 26 \\times 4 = 104 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Sophia can drive **104 miles** on a single tank of gas.",
    "answer": "To find miles per gallon divide 100 miles / 4 gallons = <<100/4=25>>25 miles per gallon\nTo find how far Olivia can go on a single tank, multiply 25 miles per gallon x 12 gallons = <<25*12=300>>300 miles\n#### 300"
