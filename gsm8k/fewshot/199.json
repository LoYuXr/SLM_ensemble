    "question": "Mark is a copy-editor. He edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Mark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the payment rate for Publisher A:**\n   Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.\n\n2. **Determine the payment rate for Publisher B:**\n   Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Therefore, the payment rate for Publisher B is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 5 \\text{ cents} = 10 \\text{ cents per sentence}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of sentences edited each week:**\n   Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.\n\n4. **Calculate the total payment for Publisher A:**\n   Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the total payment for Publisher A is:\n   \\[\n   1000 \\text{ sentences} \\times 5 \\text{ cents per sentence} = 5000 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total payment for Publisher B:**\n   Publisher B pays Mark 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, the total payment for Publisher B is:\n   \\[\n   1000 \\text{ sentences} \\times 10 \\text{ cents per sentence} = 10000 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total payment for both publishers:**\n   The total payment for both publishers is the sum of the payments for Publisher A and Publisher B:\n   \\[\n   5000 \\text{ cents} + 10000 \\text{ cents} = 15000 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Mark makes \\(\\boxed{15000}\\) cents in a week.",
    "answer": "Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.\nFrom Publisher A, he earns 5 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<5*500=2500>>2500 cents.\nSince Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.\nThus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.\nThus, he earns 2500 + 5000 = <<2500+5000=7500>>7500 cents in total.\n#### 7500"
