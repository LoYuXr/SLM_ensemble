    "question": "There are 20 students in Miss Susan's class. 5 of them are good at math only, 8 of them perform well in English only, and the rest are good at both math and English. How many are good at math?",
    "completion": "To determine how many students in Miss Susan's class are good at math, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the following:\n\n- \\( M \\) as the set of students who are good at math.\n- \\( E \\) as the set of students who perform well in English.\n- \\( |M| \\) as the number of students who are good at math.\n- \\( |E| \\) as the number of students who perform well in English.\n- \\( |M \\cap E| \\) as the number of students who are good at both math and English.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n- The total number of students in the class is 20.\n- The number of students who are good at math is 5.\n- The number of students who perform well in English is 8.\n\nSince every student in the class is either good at math, English, or both, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find \\( |M \\cap E| \\). The principle of inclusion and exclusion for two sets states that:\n\n\\[ |M \\cup E| = |M| + |E| - |M \\cap E| \\]\n\nHere, \\( |M \\cup E| \\) is the total number of students in the class, which is 20. We know \\( |M| = 5 \\) and \\( |E| = 8 \\). Substituting these values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 20 = 5 + 8 - |M \\cap E| \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 20 = 13 - |M \\cap E| \\]\n\nTo find \\( |M \\cap E| \\), we subtract 13 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ |M \\cap E| = 13 - 20 \\]\n\\[ |M \\cap E| = -7 \\]\n\nHowever, this result is not possible because the number of students cannot be negative. This indicates that there is an error in the interpretation of the problem or the given data. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the number of students who are good at both math and English cannot be negative. Instead, we should consider the possibility that the problem might have a different interpretation or there might be a mistake in the given data. Given the problem constraints, the correct interpretation should be that the number of students who are good at both math",
    "answer": "The number of students who are good at math includes those who are only good at math and those who are good at both math and English. The only group that isn't included is the students who are only good at English.\nThere are 20 - 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 students who are good at math.\n#### 12"
