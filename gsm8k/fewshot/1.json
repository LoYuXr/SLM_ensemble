    "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to consider the amount of blue and white fiber required and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Blue Fiber:**\n   - The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.\n\n2. **White Fiber:**\n   - The robe requires half the amount of white fiber that the blue fiber requires.\n   - Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is \\( \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\) bolt.\n\n3. **Total Bolts:**\n   - To find the total number of bolts needed, we add the number of blue and white bolts together:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ (blue bolts)} + 1 \\text{ (white bolts)} = 3 \\text{ bolts}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of bolts required for the robe is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
    "answer": "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3"
