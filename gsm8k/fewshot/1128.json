    "question": "Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam\u2019s age was twice the age of Vince. How old is Vince now?",
    "completion": "To determine Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given.\n\n1. **Identify Liam's age two years ago:**\n   Liam is currently 16 years old. Two years ago, he was:\n   \\[\n   16 - 2 = 14 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Vince's age two years ago:**\n   Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Therefore, two years ago, Vince's age was:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Vince's current age:**\n   Since two years have passed, Vince's current age is:\n   \\[\n   7 + 2 = 9 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Vince is currently \\boxed{9} years old.",
    "answer": "Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = <<16-2=14>>14 years old.\nVince's age two years ago was 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 years old because Liam's age is twice his.\nSo Vince age now is 7 + 2 = <<7+2=9>>9 years old.\n#### 9"
