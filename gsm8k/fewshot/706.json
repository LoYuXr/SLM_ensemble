    "question": "The local firefighters are doing a \u201cfill the boot\u201d fundraiser. Their goal is to raise $6300. After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100.  For how many hours do they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal, assuming an equal amount raised in every hour?",
    "completion": "To determine how many hours the local firefighters need to raise the remaining amount to reach their goal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the remaining amount to be raised:**\n   The total goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining amount} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount:**\n   The firefighters need to raise $4200 over an equal number of hours. Let \\( h \\) be the number of hours they need to raise the remaining amount.\n   \\[\n   h \\times \\text{hourly rate} = 4200\n   \\]\n   Since the hourly rate is the same, we can simplify this to:\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{4200}{\\text{hourly rate}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the hourly rate:**\n   The firefighters have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. To find the hourly rate, we divide the total amount raised in the first 3 hours by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Hourly rate} = \\frac{2100}{3} = 700\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of hours needed:**\n   Now that we know the hourly rate is $700, we can find the total number of hours needed to raise the remaining $4200:\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{4200}{700} = 6\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for \\(\\boxed{6}\\) hours in total to reach their goal of $6300.",
    "answer": "The fireman raise 2100 / 3 = $<<2100/3=700>>700 per hour.\nThey have to fundraise for 6300 / 700 = <<6300/700=9>>9 hours.\n#### 9"
