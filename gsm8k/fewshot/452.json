    "question": "A car is on a road trip and drives 60 mph for 2 hours, and then 30 mph for 1 hour. What is the car's average speed in mph during this trip?",
    "completion": "To calculate the car's average speed during the trip, we need to determine the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then use the formula for average speed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance traveled:\n\n1. For the first part of the trip, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance}_1 = 60 \\text{ mph} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 120 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. For the second part of the trip, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance}_2 = 30 \\text{ mph} \\times 1 \\text{ hour} = 30 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we add the distances to find the total distance:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Distance} = \\text{Distance}_1 + \\text{Distance}_2 = 120 \\text{ miles} + 30 \\text{ miles} = 150 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total time taken:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time} = 2 \\text{ hours} + 1 \\text{ hour} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we use the formula for average speed:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} = \\frac{150 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ hours}} = 50 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph.",
    "answer": "The car drives 60*2=<<60*2=120>>120 miles for 2 hours.\nThe car drives 30*1=<<30*1=30>>30 miles for 1 hour.\nIt drives a total of 120+30=<<120+30=150>>150 miles.\nLet S be the average speed, M be the number of miles, and H the number of hours spent driving.\nThen we have, S=M/H, so, S=150 miles/3 hours = <<150/3=50>>50 mph\n#### 50"
