    "question": "The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. If the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, how many more popsicles does Sam have more than Betty?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles. The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, which means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have a total of 165 popsicles.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many popsicles each person has. Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \\(5x\\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \\(6x\\), where \\(x\\) is a common multiplier. The sum of the popsicles they have together is given by:\n\\[5x + 6x = 165\\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[11x = 165\\]\nTo find \\(x\\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:\n\\[x = \\frac{165}{11} = 15\\]\nNow that we have the value of \\(x\\), we can find the number of popsicles each person has:\n\\[5x = 5 \\times 15 = 75\\]\n\\[6x = 6 \\times 15 = 90\\]\nSo, Betty has 75 popsicles and Sam has 90 popsicles. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:\n\\[90 - 75 = 15\\]\nTherefore, Sam has \\(\\boxed{15}\\) more popsicles than Betty.",
    "answer": "The total ratio representing the number of popsicles that Betty and sam have is 5+6 = <<5+6=11>>11.\nSince Betty has 5/11 of the total number of popsicles they have together, she has 5/11*165 = <<5/11*165=75>>75 popsicles.\nSam has 165-75 = <<165-75=90>>90 popsicles.\nSam has 90-75 = <<90-75=15>>15 more popsicles than Betty.\n#### 15"
