    "question": "Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?",
    "completion": "To determine how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we need to work backwards from the information given about the remaining vacuum cleaners.\n\n1. **Identify the number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house:**\n   Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left at the orange house.\n\n2. **Determine how many vacuum cleaners were sold at the orange house:**\n   Melanie sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house. Therefore, the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\n   \\]\n   Since the number of vacuum cleaners must be a whole number, we assume she sold 2 vacuum cleaners at the orange house (as typically in such problems, the number of vacuum cleaners sold is a whole number).\n\n3. **Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the red house:**\n   Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house than to the orange house. Therefore, the number of vacuum cleaners sold to the red house is:\n   \\[\n   2 + 2 = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house:**\n   Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Therefore, the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{3} \\approx 1.67\n   \\]\n   Again, since the number of vacuum cleaners must be a whole number, we assume she sold 1 vacuum cleaner at the green house (as typically in such problems, the number of vacuum cleaners sold is a whole number).\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of vacuum cleaners sold:**\n   Adding up all the vacuum cleaners sold, we get:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ (red house)} + 4 \\text{ (green house)} + 1 \\text{ (orange house)} = 7\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with:**\n   Since Melanie sold 7 vacuum cleaners and has 5 left, the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with is:\n   \\[\n   7 + 5 = 12\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
    "answer": "First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10\nThen add two to figure out how many vacuum cleaners she had before visiting the red house: 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12\nNow we know that 2/3 * x = 12, where x is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We can find x by dividing each side of the equation by 2/3, which produces x = 18\n#### 18"
