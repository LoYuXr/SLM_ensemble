    "question": "Jenny goes to the florist to buy some flowers. Roses cost $2 each and $15 for a dozen. If she bought 15 roses and arrived with five 5 dollar bills and they only have quarters for change, how many quarters does she leave with?",
    "completion": "To determine how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the roses.\n2. Determine the total amount of money Jenny spent.\n3. Calculate the change she received.\n4. Convert the change into quarters.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the roses. Each rose costs $2, and Jenny bought 15 roses:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ roses} \\times \\$2/\\text{rose} = \\$30\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much change Jenny received. She had 5 $5 bills, which is equivalent to $25. The total amount of money she spent is $30, so the change she received is:\n\\[\n\\$25 - \\$30 = -\\$5\n\\]\nSince the change is negative, it means she spent $5 more than she had. This means she did not have enough money to buy the roses. However, the problem states that she only has quarters for change, so we need to consider the change as a negative amount of money.\n\nNow, let's convert the negative change into quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we can convert the negative change into quarters by dividing the negative amount by $0.25:\n\\[\n-5 \\text{ dollars} \\div \\$0.25/\\text{quarter} = -20 \\text{ quarters}\n\\]\nSince we can't have a negative number of quarters, we need to consider the absolute value of the change, which is 20 quarters. Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",
    "answer": "Jenny has $25 because 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25\nShe buys 1 dozen roses and 3 single roses because 15 - 12 - 3 = <<15-12-3=0>>0\nShe spends $6 on the single roses because 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6\nShe spends $21 on roses because 15 + 6 = <<15+6=21>>21\nShe gets $4 in change because 25 - 21 = <<25-21=4>>4\nShe gets 16 quarters because 4 x 4 = <<4*4=16>>16\n#### 16"
