    "question": "Jake's family wants to compare the cost of the two different amusement parks. The first amusement park has a $26 fee for each adult and a $12 fee for each child; while the second amusement park has a $14 fee for each adult and $10 for each child. If there are 2 adults and 2 children in their family, how much will they be able to save if they choose the second amusement park over the first?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each amusement park and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:\n- The cost for each adult is $26.\n- The cost for each child is $12.\n- There are 2 adults and 2 children.\n\nThe total cost for the first amusement park is:\n\\[ 26 \\times 2 + 12 \\times 2 = 52 + 24 = 76 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:\n- The cost for each adult is $14.\n- The cost for each child is $10.\n- There are 2 adults and 2 children.\n\nThe total cost for the second amusement park is:\n\\[ 14 \\times 2 + 10 \\times 2 = 28 + 20 = 48 \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in cost between the second amusement park and the first amusement park:\n\\[ 76 - 48 = 28 \\]\n\nTherefore, if they choose the second amusement park over the first, they will save \\(\\boxed{28}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "The two adults pay $26 x 2 = $<<26*2=52>>52 for the first amusement park.\nWhile the two children's tickets cost $12 x 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24 for the first amusement park.\nSo, they will pay a total of $52 + $24 = $<<52+24=76>>76 for the first amusement park.\nThe two adults pay $14 x 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28 for the second amusement park.\nWhile the two children's tickets for the second amusement park cost $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.\nSo, they will pay a total of $28 + $20 = $<<28+20=48>>48 for the second amusement park.\nThus, they will save $76 - $48 = $<<76-48=28>>28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.\n#### 28"
