    "question": "To make a call from a payphone, you must pay $0.25 for each minute of your call. After 16 minutes, that price drops to $0.2 per minute. How much would a 36-minute call cost?",
    "completion": "To determine the cost of a 36-minute call from a payphone, we need to break down the cost into two parts: the cost of the first 16 minutes and the cost of the remaining 20 minutes.\n\n1. **Cost of the first 16 minutes:**\n   - The cost per minute for the first 16 minutes is $0.25.\n   - Therefore, the cost for the first 16 minutes is:\n     \\[\n     16 \\text{ minutes} \\times \\$0.25/\\text{minute} = \\$4.00\n     \\]\n\n2. **Cost of the remaining 20 minutes:**\n   - The cost per minute for the remaining 20 minutes is $0.20.\n   - Therefore, the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is:\n     \\[\n     20 \\text{ minutes} \\times \\$0.20/\\text{minute} = \\$4.00\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total cost:**\n   - To find the total cost of the 36-minute call, we add the cost of the first 16 minutes to the cost of the remaining 20 minutes:\n     \\[\n     \\$4.00 + \\$4.00 = \\$8.00\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total cost of a 36-minute call from a payphone is \\(\\boxed{8.00}\\).",
    "answer": "First 16 minutes would be a cost of 16 * 0.25 = $<<16*0.25=4>>4.\nAfter that, there are 36 - 16 = <<36-16=20>>20 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 20 minutes cost 20 * 0.2 = $<<20*0.2=4>>4.\nSo in total, the 36-minute call would cost 4 + 4 = $8.\n#### 8"
