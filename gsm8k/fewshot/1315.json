    "question": "There are some oranges in a basket. Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange and Jane spends 4 minutes doing the same. If Ana and Jane start picking oranges from this basket to peel at the same time, how many more oranges will Ana have peeled than Jane after an hour?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each person peels in an hour and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana peels in an hour. Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, so in one hour (60 minutes), she will peel:\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\text{ oranges}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane peels in an hour. Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, so in one hour, she will peel:\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{4} = 15 \\text{ oranges}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane after an hour. We do this by subtracting the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels:\n\\[\n20 - 15 = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled \\(\\boxed{5}\\) more oranges than Jane.",
    "answer": "There are 60 minutes in an hour. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes so she will peel 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 oranges in an hour\nJane peels an orange in 4 minutes so she will peel 60/4 = <<60/4=15>>15 oranges in an hour\nAna will have peeled 20-15 = <<20-15=5>>5 more oranges\n#### 5"
