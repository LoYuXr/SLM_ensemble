    "question": "Pam and Fred went to a carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times while Fred rode it 4 times. After that, each of them decided to ride the luge 2 times. If each ride cost 6 tickets, how many tickets did they use that day?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of tickets Pam and Fred used, we need to calculate the number of tickets each of them used and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of tickets Pam used:\n- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.\n- Each ride costs 6 tickets.\n- Therefore, the total number of tickets Pam used is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ rides} \\times 6 \\text{ tickets/ride} = 12 \\text{ tickets}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of tickets Fred used:\n- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.\n- Each ride costs 6 tickets.\n- Therefore, the total number of tickets Fred used is:\n  \\[\n  4 \\text{ rides} \\times 6 \\text{ tickets/ride} = 24 \\text{ tickets}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the tickets used by both Pam and Fred:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ tickets (Pam)} + 24 \\text{ tickets (Fred)} = 36 \\text{ tickets}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of tickets they used that day is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The total times that they ride the roller coaster is 2+4=<<2+4=6>>6 times.\nThe total times that they ride the luge is 2+2=<<2+2=4>>4 times.\nThe total times they ride that day is 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10 times.\nSo, Pam and Fred used 10x6=<<10*6=60>>60 tickets that day.\n#### 60"
