    "question": "4 adults and 8 children are to share 8 packets of chocolate bars. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. If each adult gets 6 chocolate bars and the rest are to be shared equally among the children, how many will each child get?",
    "completion": "To determine how many chocolate bars each child will get, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of chocolate bars available.\n2. Determine how many chocolate bars each adult gets.\n3. Calculate the number of chocolate bars left after giving each adult their share.\n4. Determine how many chocolate bars each child will get with the remaining chocolate bars.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:\n- There are 8 packets of chocolate bars.\n- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.\n- Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars is \\(8 \\times 5 = 40\\).\n\nNext, we calculate how many chocolate bars each adult gets:\n- There are 4 adults.\n- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.\n- Therefore, the number of chocolate bars each adult gets is \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\).\n\nNow, we calculate the number of chocolate bars left after giving each adult their share:\n- The total number of chocolate bars is 40.\n- Each adult gets 24 chocolate bars.\n- Therefore, the number of chocolate bars left is \\(40 - 24 = 16\\).\n\nFinally, we determine how many chocolate bars each child will get with the remaining chocolate bars:\n- There are 8 children.\n- The number of chocolate bars each child gets is \\(16 \\div 8 = 2\\).\n\nSo, each child will get \\(\\boxed{2}\\) chocolate bars.",
    "answer": "Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars so 8 packets contain a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 bars\nEach adult gets 6 bars so 4 adults will get 6*4 = <<6*4=24>>24 bars in total\nThere are now 40-24 = <<40-24=16>>16 bars left\n16 bars are shared equally among 8 children, so each child will get 16/8 = <<16/8=2>>2 bars\n#### 2"
