    "question": "Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.  Billy took twice as many as Kyle.  Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, and then Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken.  If in the end Griffin had 27 fries, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?",
    "completion": "To determine how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of fries each person took step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of fries:**\n   Griffin had 24 fries.\n\n2. **Kyle took 5 fries:**\n   After Kyle took his fries, Griffin had:\n   \\[\n   24 - 5 = 19 \\text{ fries}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle:**\n   Billy took:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ fries}\n   \\]\n   After Billy took his fries, Griffin had:\n   \\[\n   19 - 10 = 9 \\text{ fries}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries:**\n   Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \\( x \\). After Ginger gave her fries, Griffin had:\n   \\[\n   9 + x \\text{ fries}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken:**\n   Colby took:\n   \\[\n   5 - 3 = 2 \\text{ fries}\n   \\]\n   After Colby took his fries, Griffin had:\n   \\[\n   (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x \\text{ fries}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final number of fries Griffin had:**\n   According to the problem, Griffin had 27 fries at the end. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   7 + x = 27\n   \\]\n\n7. **Solving for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = 27 - 7 = 20\n   \\]\n\nThus, Ginger gave Griffin \\(\\boxed{20}\\) fries.",
    "answer": "Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.\nBilly took twice as many as Kyle, removing 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 fries.\nColby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, removing 5-3=<<5-3=2>>2 fries.\nIf we let X be the number of fries given to Griffin by Ginger, then 24-5-10-2+x=27\nThus, Ginger had given Griffin x=20 fries\n#### 20"
