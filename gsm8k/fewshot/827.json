    "question": "Milly needs to return a book she decided was really boring. The book weighs 4 pounds, cost $32, and needs to be returned to a distribution center 20 miles away. If the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile, and Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, how much money will Milly lose?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of returning the book and then find out what 75% of the book's purchase price is.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of returning the book:\n- The book weighs 4 pounds.\n- The cost per pound is $32.\n- The total cost is \\(4 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$32/\\text{pound} = \\$128\\).\n\nNext, we need to calculate the shipping cost:\n- The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.\n- The book needs to be returned 20 miles away.\n- The cost per mile is $0.08.\n- The total shipping cost is \\(20 \\text{ miles} \\times \\$0.35/\\text{mile} + \\$0.08 \\times 20 \\text{ miles} = \\$7.00 + \\$1.60 = \\$8.60\\).\n\nNow, we add the shipping cost to the total cost of the book to get the total cost of returning the book and shipping:\n- Total cost = \\$128 + \\$8.60 = \\$136.60.\n\nFinally, we calculate 75% of the book's purchase price to find out how much Milly will lose:\n- 75% of \\$128 = \\(0.75 \\times \\$128 = \\$96\\).\n\nTherefore, Milly will lose \\(\\boxed{96}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "Milly will get back from Amazon $32 * .75 = $<<32*.75=24>>24 once the book is returned.\nShe will lose $32 - 24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 when the book is returned.\nThe first part of the shipping cost is $0.35 per pound * 4 pounds = $<<0.35*4=1.40>>1.40\nThe second part of the shipping cost is $0.08 per mile * 20 miles = $<<0.08*20=1.60>>1.60\nMilly loses $8 + $1.40 + $1.60 = $<<8+1.4+1.6=11>>11\n#### 11"
