    "question": "A trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag. If it costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse, and the trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each, how many bags did he sell?",
    "completion": "To determine how many bags of wheat the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost of the wheat and the total revenue from selling the wheat, and then find out how many bags were sold.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the wheat. The trader bought the wheat at a rate of $20 per bag and made a total profit of $400. Therefore, the total cost of the wheat is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\text{Profit} + \\text{Cost per bag} = 400 + 20 = 420\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many bags of wheat were sold. The total revenue from selling the wheat is $30 per bag. Let \\( x \\) be the number of bags sold. The total revenue from selling \\( x \\) bags is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total revenue} = 30x\n\\]\n\nSince the total revenue is equal to the total cost, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n30x = 420\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 30:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{420}{30} = 14\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the trader sold \\(\\boxed{14}\\) bags of wheat.",
    "answer": "Each bag of wheat cost the trader $20+$2=$<<20+2=22>>22 (taking transportation costs into account)\nEach bag of wheat was sold for $30 each giving a profit of $30-$22=$<<30-22=8>>8 on each bag\nSince a total of $400 profit was made, the total number of bags sold is $400/$8=<<400/8=50>>50 bags\n#### 50"
