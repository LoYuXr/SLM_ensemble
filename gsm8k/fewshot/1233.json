    "question": "Walter bought 60 apples from the store. He ate 2/5 of them and gave his sister 25% of the remaining number. If he then sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each, how much money did he receive?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Walter received, we need to follow the steps of his transactions and calculate the remaining apples and the amount he received from selling them.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of apples Walter ate:**\n   Walter ate \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) of the 60 apples.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Apples eaten} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 60 = 24\n   \\]\n   So, the number of apples remaining after eating is:\n   \\[\n   60 - 24 = 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of apples Walter gave to his sister:**\n   Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Apples given to sister} = 0.25 \\times 36 = 9\n   \\]\n   So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:\n   \\[\n   36 - 9 = 27\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples:**\n   Walter sold the remaining 27 apples at $3 each.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money received} = 27 \\times 3 = 81\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Walter received is \\(\\boxed{81}\\).",
    "answer": "From the 60 apples that Walter bought, he ate 2/5*60=<<2/5*60=24>>24 apples\nThe number of apples remaining was 60-24=<<60-24=36>>36\nWalter gave 25/100*36=<<25/100*36=9>>9 apples to his sister.\nHe remained with 36-9=<<36-9=27>>27 apples.\nHe then sold the apples for 27*$3=$<<27*3=81>>81 to his uncle.\n#### 81"
