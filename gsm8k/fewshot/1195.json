    "question": "Mr. Maxim works at The Best Cookeries Around restaurant. On a particular day, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning to eat. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant and ordered the same amount of food as the first people. After a while, twice the number of people who entered the restaurant at 10:00 came in and ordered lunch. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day.",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of people who entered The Best Cookeries Around restaurant on that particular day, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Entry:**\n   - At 10:00, 50 people entered the restaurant.\n\n2. **Second Group:**\n   - At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.\n   - Total people at 10:00: \\(50 + 40 = 90\\).\n\n3. **Third Group:**\n   - At 10:00, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in.\n   - Total people at 10:00: \\(90 \\times 2 = 180\\).\n\n4. **Fourth Group:**\n   - At 10:00, an additional 3 times as many people came in as the number that entered at 10:00.\n   - Total people at 10:00: \\(180 \\times 3 = 540\\).\n\n5. **Fifth Group:**\n   - At 10:00, an additional 3 times as many people came in as the number that entered at 10:00.\n   - Total people at 10:00: \\(540 \\times 3 = 1620\\).\n\n6. **Sixth Group:**\n   - At 10:00, an additional 3 times as many people came in as the number that entered at 10:00.\n   - Total people at 10:00: \\(1620 \\times 3 = 4860\\).\n\n7. **Seventh Group:**\n   - At 10:00, an additional 3 times as many people came in as the number that entered at 10:00.\n   - Total people at 10:00: \\(4860 \\times 3 = 14580\\).\n\n8. **Eighth Group:**\n   - At 10:00, an additional 3 times as many people came in as the number that entered at 10:00.\n   - Total people at 10:00: \\(14580 \\times 3 = 437",
    "answer": "The number of people who came in at lunch is twice the number that came in at 10:00: 2 * 40 people = <<2*40=80>>80 people.\nAn additional 50 people * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 people came into the restaurant by evening.\nThe total number of people who entered the restaurant was 80 people + 150 people + 50 people + 40 people = <<80+150+50+40=320>>320 people.\n#### 320"
