    "question": "Bill is trying to figure out how many water bottles he needs to buy for his party.  He started out with 2 cases of water which have 24 bottles each. He has 70 guests that will be arriving, and he wants to have 2 bottles of water for each guest. How many additional bottles of water will he need to buy?",
    "completion": "To determine how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of water bottles Bill has initially.\n2. Calculate the total number of bottles needed for the guests.\n3. Determine the difference between the number of bottles needed and the number of bottles Bill currently has.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of water bottles Bill has initially:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ cases} \\times 24 \\text{ bottles per case} = 48 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed for the guests:\n\\[ 70 \\text{ guests} \\times 2 \\text{ bottles per guest} = 140 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy:\n\\[ 140 \\text{ bottles needed} - 48 \\text{ bottles already have} = 92 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nTherefore, Bill will need to buy \\(\\boxed{92}\\) additional bottles of water.",
    "answer": "Bill has 2 cases of 24 bottles each, so he has 24 * 2 = <<2*24=48>>48 bottles of water\nBill needs enough water for 70 guests to have 2 bottles each, so he needs 70+70 = <<70+70=140>>140 bottles of water.\nBill needs 140 bottles of water and has 48, so he needs to buy 140- 48 = <<140-48=92>>92 bottles of water.\n#### 92"
