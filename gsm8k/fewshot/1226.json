    "question": "A basic manicure starts at $35 while a pedicure starts at $40. A certain salon offers 20% off if you get both. Suppose Karen chooses to do both and would also like to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. How much would she pay in all?",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost for Karen, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure, the pedicure, and the nail art separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. **Cost of the manicure:**\n   - The basic manicure costs $35.\n   - The pedicure costs $40.\n   - The salon offers a 20% discount on both the manicure and the pedicure.\n   - The discount on the manicure is \\(35 \\times 0.20 = 7\\) dollars.\n   - The discount on the pedicure is \\(40 \\times 0.20 = 8\\) dollars.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the manicure and the pedicure is \\(35 + 40 - 7 - 8 = 50\\) dollars.\n\n2. **Cost of the nail art:**\n   - The nail art costs $3 per finger.\n   - Karen has 5 fingers, so the total cost for the nail art is \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) dollars.\n\n3. **Total cost:**\n   - The total cost for Karen is the sum of the manicure cost, the pedicure cost, and the nail art cost.\n   - Therefore, the total cost is \\(50 + 15 = 65\\) dollars.\n\nThe total amount Karen would pay is \\(\\boxed{65}\\).",
    "answer": "The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.\nThe discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.\nSo, Karen would only pay $75-$15=$<<75-15=60>>60 for both services.\nThe cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.\nTherefore, Karen would pay a total of $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90.\n#### 90"
