    "question": "April is donating plant pots to a local school for their new garden. They ask for 30 plant pots for the daisies, and twice as many for the roses. April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center before she knew how many she needed. How many plant pots does April have left over?",
    "completion": "To determine how many plant pots April has left over, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses.\n2. Determine the total number of plant pots required.\n3. Subtract the number of plant pots already bought from the total required.\n\nFirst, we know that April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. Since she needs twice as many for the roses, we calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses as follows:\n\\[ 30 \\times 2 = 60 \\text{ plant pots} \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots required:\n\\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \\text{ plant pots} \\]\n\nApril already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the number of plant pots she bought from the total number of plant pots required:\n\\[ 90 - 100 = -10 \\]\n\nSince the result is negative, it means that April does not have enough plant pots to complete the order. She is short by 10 plant pots. Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:\n\\[ \\boxed{-10} \\]",
    "answer": "For the roses, the school wants 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 plant pots.\nThis means she is giving the school 60 plant pots for roses + 30 plant pots for daisies = <<60+30=90>>90 plant pots.\nSo in total, Alice has 100 \u2013 90 = <<100-90=10>>10 plant pots left over.\n#### 10"
