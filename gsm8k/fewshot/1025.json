    "question": "The Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. How many eggs did the friends find?",
    "completion": "To determine how many eggs the friends found, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of eggs initially hidden.\n2. Determine how many eggs were found by the Smith twins.\n3. Calculate the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and their friends combined.\n4. Subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and their friends from the total number of eggs to find out how many eggs were found by the friends.\n\nLet's go through these steps in detail:\n\n1. The total number of eggs initially hidden is 100.\n2. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins is:\n   \\[\n   30 + 30 = 60\n   \\]\n3. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. So, the number of eggs found by the friends is:\n   \\[\n   100 - 60 = 40\n   \\]\n4. The number of eggs found by the Smith twins and their friends combined is:\n   \\[\n   60 + 40 = 100\n   \\]\n5. The number of eggs found by the friends is the total number of eggs minus the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and their friends:\n   \\[\n   100 - 100 = 0\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",
    "answer": "The Smith twins found, 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 eggs.\nThe number that remained hidden was 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40 eggs\nSince 10 eggs were not found, this means the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs\n#### 30"
