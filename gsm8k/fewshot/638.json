    "question": "In a grocery store, four apples cost $5.20, and three oranges cost $3.30. How much will Clyde pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one apple and one orange. We know that four apples cost $5.20 and three oranges cost $3.30. Let's calculate the cost of one apple and one orange.\n\nFirst, we find the cost of one apple:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of one apple} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of four apples}}{4} = \\frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the cost of one orange:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of one orange} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of three oranges}}{3} = \\frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \\times 1.30 = 6.50\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \\times 1.10 = 5.50\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Clyde will pay \\(\\boxed{12.00}\\) for 5 apples and 5 oranges.",
    "answer": "Each apple costs $5.20/4 = $<<5.20/4=1.30>>1.30.\nEach orange cost $3.30/3 = $<<3.30/3=1.10>>1.10.\nSo 5 apples cost $1.30 x 5 = $<<5*1.30=6.50>>6.50.\nAnd 5 oranges cost $1.10 x 5 = $<<5*1.1=5.50>>5.50.\nThus, Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $<<6.5+5.5=12>>12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.\n#### 12"
