    "question": "Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops this week. Last week she bought 4 boxes of cereal. How many more boxes of cereal did she buy this week than last week?",
    "completion": "To determine how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of boxes of cereal bought this week.\n2. Calculate the total number of boxes of cereal bought last week.\n3. Find the difference between the number of boxes bought this week and last week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of boxes of cereal bought this week:\n- Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch.\n- Castle bought 5 boxes of Fruit Loops.\n- Therefore, the total number of boxes of cereal bought this week is \\(3 + 5 = 8\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of boxes of cereal bought last week:\n- Castle bought 4 boxes of cereal last week.\n\nNow, we find the difference between the number of boxes bought this week and last week:\n- The difference is \\(8 - 4 = 4\\).\n\nSo, Castle bought \\(\\boxed{4}\\) more boxes of cereal this week than last week.",
    "answer": "Castle has 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 boxes of cereals this week.\nTherefore, Castle bought 8 - 4 = <<8-4=4>>4 more boxes of cereals this week than last week.\n#### 4"
