    "question": "A company produces chocolate in bars. In one day, it can produce 5000 bars. The company sells all the produced bars for $2 per bar. How much money will the company receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money the company will receive for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks.\n2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the produced bars.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks. Since the company produces 5000 bars per day and there are 14 days in two weeks, we can calculate the total production as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total production} = 5000 \\text{ bars/day} \\times 14 \\text{ days} = 70000 \\text{ bars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total revenue from selling these 70000 bars at $2 per bar. The total revenue is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total revenue} = 70000 \\text{ bars} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the company will receive \\(\\boxed{140000}\\) dollars for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks.",
    "answer": "During two weeks the company can produce 14 * 5000 = <<14*5000=70000>>70000.\nIf the price of 1 bar is $2, the company will be able to make 70000 * 2 = $<<70000*2=140000>>140000 from the sales.\n#### 140000"
