    "question": "Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. Calculate the total cost of buying each cup.",
    "completion": "To determine the total cost of buying each cup, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of buying half a dozen plates.\n2. Determine the cost of buying twenty dozen cups.\n3. Find the cost of one cup.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of buying half a dozen plates. Since half a dozen is 6 plates, the total cost is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 6000 = 36000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:\n\\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups cost $34800, the cost of one cup is:\n\\[ \\frac{34800}{20} = 1740 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the total cost of buying each cup is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1740} \\]",
    "answer": "Since a dozen has 12 items, half a dozen plates are 12/2 = <<6=6>>6\nHalf a dozen plates sold at $6000 each cost 6*$6000 = $<<6*6000=36000>>36000\nTwenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, meaning the twenty dozen cups cost a total of $36000-$1200 = 34800\nSince a dozen has 12 items, twenty dozen cups are 20*12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.\nIf the twenty dozen cups cost $34800, each cup costs $34800/240=$<<34800/240=145>>145\n#### 145"
