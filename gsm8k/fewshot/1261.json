    "question": "Alicia's clothes have to be sent to the dry cleaners weekly.  Her weekly drop-off includes 5 blouses, 2 pants and 1 skirt.  If they charge her $5.00 per blouse, $6.00 per skirt and $8.00 per pair of pants, how much does she spend on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks?",
    "completion": "To determine how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to calculate the cost of the clothes she drops off each week and then multiply that by 5.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the clothes for one week:\n- Alicia drops off 5 blouses.\n- Alicia drops off 1 skirt.\n- Alicia drops off 2 pants.\n\nThe cost of the blouses is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ blouses} \\times \\$5.00 \\text{ per blouse} = \\$25.00 \\]\n\nThe cost of the skirts is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ skirt} \\times \\$8.00 \\text{ per skirt} = \\$8.00 \\]\n\nThe cost of the pants is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ pants} \\times \\$6.00 \\text{ per pair of pants} = \\$12.00 \\]\n\nNow, we sum these costs to find the total weekly cost:\n\\[ \\$25.00 + \\$8.00 + \\$12.00 = \\$45.00 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for 5 weeks:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ weeks} \\times \\$45.00 \\text{ per week} = \\$225.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{225}\n\\]",
    "answer": "The blouses cost $5.00 each to dry clean and she has 5 so that's 5*5 = $<<5*5=25.00>>25.00\nThe one skirt she has costs $6.00 to dry clean\nThe pants cost $8.00 to dry clean and she has 2 pairs so that's 8*2 = $<<8*2=16.00>>16.00\nIn one week she spends 25+6+16 = $<<25+6+16=47.00>>47.00 on dry cleaning\nOver 5 weeks, she will spend 5*47 = $<<5*47=235.00>>235.00 on dry cleaning\n#### 235"
