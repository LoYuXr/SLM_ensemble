    "question": "Ashley has an internet connection speed of 20kb per second. Knowing that 1 Mb has 1000 kb, she wants to know her internet connection speed in Mb per hour. What is Ashley\u2019s internet connection speed in Mb per hour?",
    "completion": "To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the internet speed from kb/s to Mb/s:**\n   - Given: 20 kb/s\n   - 1 Mb = 1000 kb\n   - Therefore, 20 kb/s = \\( \\frac{20}{1000} \\) Mb/s = 0.02 Mb/s\n\n2. **Convert the internet speed from kb/s to Mb/h:**\n   - 1 hour = 3600 seconds\n   - Therefore, 0.02 Mb/s = \\( \\frac{0.02}{3600} \\) Mb/h = 0.00000556111 Mb/h\n\nSo, Ashley's internet connection speed is approximately 0.00000556111 Mb per hour.",
    "answer": "With a speed of 20 kb per second, there are 20*60 = <<20*60=1200>>1200 kb per minute.\nAs 1Mb has 1000kb, the converted speed is 1200/1000=<<1200/1000=1.2>>1.2Mb per minute.\nSo, Ashley\u2019s internet connection speed is 1.2*60 = <<1.2*60=72>>72Mb per hour.\n#### 72"
