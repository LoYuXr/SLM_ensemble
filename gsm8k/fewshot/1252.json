    "question": "Dominick went to his team's changing room and saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs kept there. If there were 20 helmets, calculate the total number of items Dominick saw.",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of helmets.\n2. Use the information about the number of helmets to find the number of robots.\n3. Use the information about the number of robots to find the number of footballs.\n4. Sum the number of helmets, robots, and footballs to get the total number of items.\n\nLet's start with the number of helmets:\n\\[ \\text{Number of helmets} = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we use the information about the number of robots. According to the problem, the number of robots is half the number of helmets:\n\\[ \\text{Number of robots} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\]\n\nThen, we use the information about the number of footballs. The problem states that the number of robots is half the number of footballs:\n\\[ \\text{Number of footballs} = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of helmets, robots, and footballs to find the total number of items:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of items} = \\text{Number of helmets} + \\text{Number of robots} + \\text{Number of footballs} = 20 + 10 + 20 = 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is:\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",
    "answer": "If the number of helmets was 20, there were 2 footballs/helmet * 20 helmets = <<20*2=40>>40 footballs\nThere were half as many robots as helmets, so in total, there were 1 robot/2 helmets * 20 helmets = <<1/2*20=10>>10 robots.\nThe total number of items in the changing room is 10 robots + 40 footballs + 20 helmets = <<10+40+20=70>>70 items\n#### 70"
