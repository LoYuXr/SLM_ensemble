    "question": "Tim gets a promotion that offers him a 5% raise on his $20000 a month salary.  It also gives him a bonus worth half a month's salary. How much money will he make in a year?",
    "completion": "To determine how much money Tim will make in a year after receiving a 5% raise and a bonus, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the salary after the 5% raise.\n2. Calculate the bonus.\n3. Add the salary and the bonus to get the total salary for the year.\n\nLet's start with the salary after the raise:\n\\[ \\text{Salary after raise} = \\text{Original salary} + (\\text{Original salary} \\times 5\\%) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Salary after raise} = 20000 + (20000 \\times 0.05) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Salary after raise} = 20000 + 1000 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Salary after raise} = 21000 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the bonus:\n\\[ \\text{Bonus} = \\text{Salary after raise} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Bonus} = 21000 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Bonus} = 10500 \\]\n\nNow, we add the salary and the bonus to find the total salary for the year:\n\\[ \\text{Total salary for the year} = \\text{Salary after raise} + \\text{Bonus} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total salary for the year} = 21000 + 10500 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total salary for the year} = 31500 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Tim will make in a year is:\n\\[ \\boxed{31500} \\]",
    "answer": "The promotion increased his monthly salary by 20000*.05=$<<20000*0.05=1000>>1000\nSo his new salary is 20000+1000=$<<20000+1000=21000>>21000 a month\nSo he makes 21000*12=$<<21000*12=252000>>252,000 a year\nThe bonus is worth 21000*.5=$<<21000*.5=10500>>10500\nSo he makes 252,000+10,500=$<<252000+10500=262500>>262,500 for the year\n#### 262500"
