    "question": "A company wanted to buy 500 computers and had $700 for each computer. However, when they went to order, they realized the price of each computer was 10% higher than they had planned for. Calculate the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices.",
    "completion": "To determine the total amount of money the company paid for the computers at the new prices, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the original price of each computer:**\n   The company had $700 for each computer and wanted to buy 500 computers.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Original price per computer} = \\frac{700}{500} = 1.40 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the new price of each computer:**\n   The price of each computer was 10% higher than the original price.\n   \\[\n   \\text{New price per computer} = 1.40 + 0.10 \\times 1.40 = 1.40 + 0.14 = 1.54 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost for 500 computers at the new price:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 500 \\times 1.54 = 770 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is \\(\\boxed{770}\\) dollars.",
    "answer": "When they went to order, the company realized the prices of each computer had increased by 10/100*700 = $<<10/100*700=70>>70\nThe total buying price at the new prize is $700+$70 = $<<700+70=770>>770\nSince they wanted to buy 500 computers, they paid a total of $770*500 = $<<770*500=385000>>385000\n#### 385000"
