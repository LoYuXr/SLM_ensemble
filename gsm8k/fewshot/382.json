    "question": "Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. He visits her friend Anna who has twice as many silver pesos as he has and 40 more gold pesos. What's the total number of pesos they have together?",
    "completion": "To determine the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the number of each type of peso they each have and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many silver pesos Anna has. According to the problem, Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel. Since Axel has 50 silver pesos, we calculate:\n\\[ \\text{Anna's silver pesos} = 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many gold pesos Anna has. The problem states that Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel. Since Axel has 80 gold pesos, we calculate:\n\\[ \\text{Anna's gold pesos} = 80 + 40 = 120 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the total number of pesos each person has by adding their individual amounts of silver and gold pesos:\n\\[ \\text{Axel's total pesos} = 50 + 80 = 130 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Anna's total pesos} = 100 + 120 = 220 \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the total number of pesos that Axel and Anna have together:\n\\[ \\text{Total pesos} = 130 + 220 = 350 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pesos they have together is:\n\\[ \\boxed{350} \\]",
    "answer": "Axel has 50 + 80 = <<50+80=130>>130 pesos.\nHis friend Anna has 2 * 50 = <<2*50=100>>100 silver pesos.\nAnna also has 80 + 40 =<<80+40=120>>120 gold pesos.\nThe total number of pesos that Anna has is 120+100 = <<120+100=220>>220.\nThe combined total for the two friends is 130 + 220 = <<130+220=350>>350 pesos.\n#### 350"
